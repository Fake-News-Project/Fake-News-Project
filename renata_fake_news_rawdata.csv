China has demanded that India pull back its troops from a contested region high in the Himalayas, warning New Delhi not “to push your luck” amid a festering border dispute.

According to Indian officials, about 300 soldiers from either side face each other about 150 metres apart on the Doklam plateau, an area also claimed by India’s ally Bhutan.

What do you think India Should do?

(comment below)



The stand-off began in June when Chinese troops started building a road onto the plateau towards India’s border.

Bhutan sought help from India, which sent troops across the border from the northeastern state of Sikkim.

Watching Politics', 'Observing Human Behavior', 'Writing Are All Long-Time Interests.', 'In Her Other Life']","One thing is assured any time the pope – any pope – talks about a “controversial” topic. People will listen. Even people who have eschewed the Catholic Church and all she stands for if for no other reason to ridicule and lecture Catholics. Well, Pope Francis made a change, again, in the absolution procedures for the sin of procuring, assisting in or causing an abortion, and all hell has broken loose. Unlike earlier in the year when a procedural convenience was made permanent, this change actually is a change.

Allow me to explain.

In the full list of sins for Catholics, abortion is one of a handful that are so heinous, they are in a category that automatically incurs what is called latae sententiae excommunication. That means that “by the act” the human puts himself or herself OUTSIDE of the Christian Community. This is not a formal bull of excommunication that is posted for heresy (teaching or espousing that which is against the Church in one way or another), but a very personal sort of separation. However, in order to have the excommunication lifted – this is a spiritual remedy, not a punishment – which would allow for absolution (it is not granted if one is excommunicated), there is some administrative paperwork that needs to happen.

Earlier in his pontificate, Pope Francis officially transferred the paperwork procedure to the parishes for abortion, rather than sending it through the bishops’ offices, a practice that had been in place in the United States and other western nations infested with modernism for decades. It just made things smoother. With Monday’s move, Canon Law actually will have to be changed as the formal procedure of lifting the excommunication has been dropped.

“I wish to restate as firmly as I can that abortion is a grave sin, since it puts an end to an innocent life,” the pope wrote. “In the same way, however, I can and must state that there is no sin that God’s mercy cannot reach and wipe away when it finds a repentant heart seeking to be reconciled with the Father.” Speaking to reporters during a Vatican news conference Nov. 21, Archbishop Rino Fisichella said procuring an abortion still results in automatic excommunication the very moment the procedure is carried out. Sacramental absolution, therefore, is not just forgiving the sin of abortion, but also means “the excommunication is removed,” he said. Now that all priests have been given the faculty to lift the excommunication and grant absolution, the Code of Canon Law will have to be updated, said the archbishop, who is president of the Pontifical Council for Promoting New Evangelization, the office that organized events for the Year of Mercy.

Pope Francis, truly, has picked up the baton of a number of late 19th century and 20th century figures in Catholicism when it comes to his message on God’s mercy. The main proponent of the message was Pope Saint John Paul II, along with a Polish nun known to him during his life who was canonized during his pontificate. Her name is St. Faustina, the Divine Mercy image to the left is taken from an entry in her papers, and her diary speaks of Divine Mercy in terms many never considered before. (It’s a tough, but good read.) By declaring the just completed Year of Mercy, Pope Francis reminds the flock that returning to God is always possible, yes, even for those who are involved with abortion. The Church is a hospital for sinners, not an exclusive club.

In Catholicism, though, there is a catch to receiving absolution no matter what your sins. Confession must be

made, and the Penance (the real name of the Sacrament) must be carried out with a contrite heart. We are supposed to be sorry for our sins. That’s something a lot of us need to work on.

Watching Politics', 'Observing Human Behavior', 'Writing Are All Long-Time Interests.', 'In Her Other Life']","Now that Donald Trump is President-elect, not just an American billionaire shooting his mouth off on the campaign trail, all of the various sectors of the world’s economy are starting to actually respond to what he had to say. Take Saudi Arabia, for example. When it looked like Hillary Clinton would win the White House, they didn’t say much as Donald Trump talked about the United States being energy independent. Now that the preferred scenario for yhe Saudis did not pan out, they are facing the prospect that one of their two industries might well dry up.

Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih warned this week that banning oil from his kingdom could backfire. “At his heart, President-elect Trump will see the benefits and I think the oil industry will also be advising him accordingly that blocking trade in any product is not healthy,” Falih told the Financial Times. The powerful Saudi minister added that “energy is the lifeblood of the global economy” and the U.S. “benefits more than anybody else from global free trade.”

Just to interpret for Americans who do not believe in nuance, that’s a threat and a dare all rolled into one. Buy oil from us, or else. After all, the sale of oil is bankrolling Saudi Arabia’s OTHER industry: exporting and setting up Islam in nations where Christianity no longer carries zeal.

Don’t know if the Saudis have been paying attention, but the world’s largest oil reserve was discovered in western Texas. The announcement was made this week. With modern technology, shipping oil across oceans just might not be needed anymore.

Given the events of the last week as President-elect Trump has begun putting together his transition team and interviewing for the Cabinet, his modus operandi has begun to take shape. He chooses his advisers carefully. Those who he considers to be part of the problem are not consulted. That universe may well include the lobbyists for OPEC, the cartel that controls oil output from almost all producers.

At this time, the United States does import oil from around the world. The largest supplier is actually Canada. Saudi Arabia is second with over a million barrels imported daily.

Yes, oil is the lifeblood of the world economy. However, the United States, technically, not only has the largest market for oil, but the largest reserves. In a right side up economic situation, this should greatly benefit us. President-elect Trump understands this, and aims to make that concept a reality.

Watching Politics', 'Observing Human Behavior', 'Writing Are All Long-Time Interests.', 'In Her Other Life']","Every new leader has his or her own style. Some are open and gregarious. Some are micromanagers. Some are dictators. Donald Trump appears to be private. At least about some things. And to the mainstream media posse that follows around the president-elect, and/or the president himself, that privacy is a barrier to them doing their jobs. Supposedly.

See, on Tuesday evening, the Trump media pool was told the day was done. Nothing else would be happening at Trump Tower. Then, later on in the evening, a reporter at Bloomberg posted this on Twitter:

Trump and the family went to the 21 Club in New York City for dinner – and they ditched the press.

Most Americans would be chuckling under their breaths at giving the media the slip. Really, does every detail of the man’s life HAVE to be broadcast to the world? According to the people who follow the president around, yes. However, Donald Trump has other ideas and the press is not amused by them. On the campaign trail, they were not permitted on his plane, and routinely Trump has decried the way in which facts and events were reported. This is setting up a contentious relationship that will undoubtedly continue when the man moves into the White House.

With his Tuesday night actions, the Trump Administration is shaping up to be the least accessible to the public and the press in modern history.

At this point, the mainstream media is smarting due to inattention, actually, which could be adding to the rancor. Trump has not held a press conference since summer, and there has not been one mention of when he might hold a presser in the future. Previous president-elects have at least held press conferences. The Trump camp does not seem inclined to do so any time in the future.

Many of us out here on the fruited plain are anxious to actually see a Trump press conference once he’s in office. The media’s big word on administrations fawning over them is “transparency.” The complaints are already starting that Trump is setting up the least transparent administration in modern memory (they seem to forget Helen Thomas taking apart of Obama’s press secretaries on that score), and all the man wanted to do was take his family to dinner.

Watching Politics', 'Observing Human Behavior', 'Writing Are All Long-Time Interests.', 'In Her Other Life']","One of the keystone issues of President-Elect Donald Trump’s campaign was the promise to deport illegal aliens who commit crimes in the United States. This should be a no brainer, but due to the concept of “sanctuary cities,” such people essentially can find asylum within the nation in any one of these locales – all run by Democrats, by the way.

On Tuesday, after President-Elect Trump once again reiterated the reality that criminal illegal aliens needed to be deported, the police chiefs in Denver and Los Angeles vowed not to cooperate with federal officials in turning over such people to be removed from the country.

Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said Monday that the force would not change its stance on immigration enforcement, the Los Angeles Times reported. The move is an apparent act of defiance against the president-elect’s promise to deport or imprison up to 3 million undocumented immigrants after his inauguration. Since 1979, the LAPD has barred officers from contacting people solely to investigate whether they are in the country legally, the LA Times noted. During Beck’s tenure, the department also stopped bringing suspects in minor crimes to federal authorities. “I don’t intend on doing anything different,” Beck told the newspaper. “We are not going to engage in law enforcement activities solely based on somebody’s immigration status. We are not going to work in conjunction with Homeland Security on deportation efforts. That is not our job, nor will I make it our job.”

Also defiant in the face of growing popular sentiment that violent criminals be deported, is the Denver Police Department:

“Immigration enforcement is handled at the federal level, not by local law enforcement,” Denver Police spokesman Doug Schepman said in a statement. “The Denver Police Department has not participated in those enforcement efforts in the past and will not be involved in the future.”

In order to find the illegal alien suspects of crime, federal law enforcement needs the cooperation of local officials. Local LEOs are the ones on the ground. Refusing to help the federal forces, the U.S. Marshalls Service and the FBI, may not go over very well. Trump also has threatened to revoke sanctuary city funding for the municipalities that refuse to cooperate.

Any way it’s sliced, this may not be all that smart a move on their parts.

Watching Politics', 'Observing Human Behavior', 'Writing Are All Long-Time Interests.', 'In Her Other Life']","Friends of Jim Webb who were in Washington to support his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for president were in for a shock on Tuesday. He dropped out. Not only did he drop out of the race, the former Republican might be dropping out of the Democratic Party. From CNN:

Speaking at the National Press Club in Washington, Webb argued the Democratic Party has moved away from “millions of dedicated, hard-working Americans.” “For this reason, I am withdrawing from any consideration of being the Democratic Party’s nominee for the presidency,” he said. “The very nature of our democracy is under siege due to the power structure and the money that finances both political parities,” Webb said, adding later that it is “time for a new Declaration of Independence — not from an outside power but from the paralysis of a federal system that no longer serves the interests of the vast majority of the American people.”… When asked if he still considers himself a Democrat, the usually blunt Webb said, “We will think about that.” “Some people say I am a Republican who became a Democrat, but that I often sound like a Republican in a room full of Democrats or a Democrat in a room full of Republicans,” Webb said. “Actually, I take that as a compliment.”

Leaving aside that we have a republic, not a democracy in this country, there is no doubt that these words and Webb’s story of being a veteran (Navy) will be attractive to any number of people who are disenchanted with the political establishment as it sits right now. The gridlock in Washington, unfortunately, follows decades of “getting things done” by those who really did not have the country’s best interests at heart and were not interested in truly serving the people. That would make a potential Jim Webb independent run for president potentially dangerous for either of the major parties.

Best of luck to Mr. Webb on his future, and may this patriot find his footing in helping to get the American government back to working for the people.

She welcomes the author of Clinton Cash, Peter Schweizer, an expert on the topic of Clinton corruption.

She notes that some documents that the Clintons had chosen not to release are being forced into the public sphere by a federal judge, Judge Emmit Sullivan. Judge Jeanine asks Mr. Schweizer “What is the latest in terms of the information that we are learning about the Clinton Foundation and that relationship between the Foundation and the State Department, under Hillary Clinton?”

Schweizer has a name for the tactic that is being employed by the Clintons, calling it the Clinton Blur. He explains as being the blurring of lines between their private activities, some of them commercial, some of them related to the Clinton Foundation, and the State Department. They were blurring them and the problem is that ethics laws don’t allow you to blur them.”

Mr. Schweizer states, “The emails that are now coming out as a result of the work of Judicial Watch and also Citizens United, are confirming that, contrary to the agreement that Hillary Clinton made with Barack Obama, promising there would be no overlap between the two, that indeed favors were done and access was given to Clinton Foundation donors by senior State Department officials. The pay to play that he wrote about in Clinton Cash is being exposed and corroborated by the emails.

Judge Jeanine says that what she finds interesting is that “We would not have found out about this, the MOU that was signed and right before Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State, she signed with Barack Obama. She swore that this was not the kind of thing that would happen. Judge Jeanine says, I’m curious as to whether or not, when Hillary handed over her emails that she said were work related, whether or not the email that involved Cheryl Mills and the request for her email addresses we just heard about, was ever turned over.” She asks of Mr. Schweizer, do you know what the answer to that is?

Schweizer says his understanding is that they still have not been turned over. He also notes that Clinton has completely violated two planks of the MOU. He says, “Number one, they said that they were going to turn over the names of all the donors – There are at least 11,000 that he says they have chosen not to disclose, so we still don’t know the names of everyone giving them money.”

They discuss other revelations contained in this latest batch of emails include the relationship with convicted money launderer Gilbert Chagoury, one that was clearly a pay for play with a foreign donor, which is illegal.

The balance of the video once Mr. Schweizer leaves contains an interview with Rosie O’Donnell, something that any decent human being would feel compelled to warn viewers of in advance. Time constraints didn’t allow for her to be edited out. It may not be the original O’Donnell, but it’s close enough to create the same kind of mental distress. It’s all the same after the initial “Dear God No,” and then the quick eye diversion anyway.

Watching Politics', 'Observing Human Behavior', 'Writing Are All Long-Time Interests.', 'In Her Other Life']","The 2016 election just got even more weird. Buried in the middle of the latest Wikileaks dump of John Podesta emails (from his gmail account, too) is this exchange:

For some context, the word or words “wetworks” has a very specific meaning in slang. From Wikipedia:

Wetwork is a euphemism for murder or assassination, alluding to spilling blood. The expression “wet work”, as well as the similar “wet job“, “wet affair”, or “wet operation”, are all calques of the euphemism used by the KGB for such activities, mokroye delo (wet dealings).[1] These operations are reputed to have been handled at the KGB by Spetsbureau 13, colorfully known as the “Department of wet affairs”

For those who are not long time political junkies, Steve Elmendorf, according to Jim Hoft of The Gateway Pundit, once worked for former congresscritter of the great State of Missouri Dick Gephardt, who was very powerful in Democratic politics when he was voted out of office.

What makes this exchange hinky is that it happened on February 9. The next death of anyone of consequence in American government was Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia at Cibolo Creek Ranch on February 12 or 13 under truly suspicious circumstances. To make matters even more hinky, there is a vineyard adjacent to the complex where Scalia’s body was found.

This coincidence could mean nothing or it could mean everything. From the beginning, Scalia’s death didn’t sit right with a lot of conservatives. He was not really sick, and no autopsy was done. He was embalmed before any investigation happened. He was also one of the few people who was in a position and WILLING to stop the progressive agenda. Not only that, with Chelsea Clinton’s words that now that Scalia was gone, they could move on gun control not even three months later, the whole Scalia death episode is smelling more and more like the KGB wetworks definition.

This little email exchange just adds to the intrigue. Was Scalia assassinated? Good question.

Before my fellow conservatives go off half cocked about the other major conservative figure death of the year – Phyllis Schlafly – this writer has knowledge via close contacts and mutual friends that she died of cancer. It was not unexpected to the family at all. She had not been doing well for quite some time.

On Labor Day, Hillary Clinton stepped to the podium in Cleveland, Ohio, to give some sort of stump speech and WHAMO! Guess what returned?

THE COUGH.

Remember the cough? The hacking, nasty, shallow with no ab strength behind it cough that kept the Hildebeast from answering questions from time to time? Well, it BA-ACK.

“Every time I think about Trump, I get allergic.” That’s probably the best joke she’s ever cracked.

To be honest, we out here in the American midwest are experiencing the end of summer mold and ragweed push. A lot of us are allergic, and have stuff stuck in our throats, but we don’t cough for minutes at a time trying unsuccessfully to bring our own bodily defenses under control. That’s an indication that there is something really wrong. Not that this writer is supposed to know that without a medical license.

Granted, today, Mrs. Clinton looks better than she has in a while, and the outfit is not the designer hospital gown she actually wore out of doors last week, but that cough….

All over the “news” punditry and the blogosphere, we on the fruited plain – as well as physicians who have read just what is public about Hillary Clinton’s medical history and care – have been warned by the #NeverTrump sorts and the Democrats that armchair diagnosing is not allowed. Nope. Even those of us who have watched multiple loved ones go downhill are not allowed to ask the question:

WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS WOMAN?

Well, as a person who is trained in vocal arts, and who has to avoid respiratory diseases around the holidays or be sidelined from the choir, that cough is nothing to sneeze at. People just don’t cough that way without reason. Something is wrong, and one does not need to be her personal physician to figure that out.

Olympic Gold Medalist,Ryan Lochte Gets A Gun To His Head In Rio

I often wondered what the contestants of the Olympics do on their down time, if they have any? On this occasion, Sunday, four Americans had a close call with almost getting shot dead.

Lochte and three of his American teammates, Gunnar Bentz, Jack Conger, and Jimmy Feigen, had been out with Brazilian swimmer Thiago Pereira when the terrifying theft took place.

Speaking on Sunday, Lochte says he had a“gun put to his forehead” by one of the muggers. “We got pulled over, in the taxi, and these guys came out with a badge, a police badge, no lights, no nothing just a police badge and they pulled us over,’ Lochte told NBC’s Today Show. ‘They pulled out their guns, they told the other swimmers to get down on the ground — they got down on the ground. I refused, I was like we didn’t do anything wrong, so — I’m not getting down on the ground. ‘And then the guy pulled out his gun, he cocked it, put it to my forehead and he said, “Get down,” and I put my hands up, I was like “whatever.” ‘He took our money, he took my wallet — he left my cell phone, he left my credentials.’ Gunnar Bentz tweeted: ‘We are all safe. Thank you for your love and support. P.s. the gold medal is safe.’

The U.S. Olympics confirmed the robbery and said it WAS carried out by men who posed as policemen.

Club France has a 4,000 person capacity and it was filled with party goers Saturday night. The Olympians were their celebrating a friends birthday party. The four members of the U.S. Olympic Swimming Team had left. ” France House” early Sunday morning in a taxi headed for the Olympic Village,’ USOC spokesperson Patrick Sandusky said in a statement.

‘Their taxi was stopped by individuals posing as armed police officers who demanded the athletes’ money and other personal belongings. All four athletes are safe and cooperating with authorities.

In an ABC town hall about race relations and police (video shown below), Patrick told Obama how most police officers feel about him, and why they feel that way.

“I’m concerned that police officers across the country, they know you support law enforcement, of course. But do they really in their heart feel like you’re doing everything you can to protect their lives?” Patrick asked.

Patrick also accused Obama of proclaiming, “Tensions between the police and between black America are only going to get worse.”

“Words matter,” Patrick said. “I would ask you to consider being careful when there is an incident of not being too quick to condemn the police without due process and until the facts are known.”

In case after case, Obama has repeatedly disrespected police officers. When a prominent black professor, Henry Louis Gates, behaved like a screaming moron, Obama immediately announced that it was POLICE who “acted stupidly”.

Obama sent White House representatives to the funeral of Michael Brown, a criminal who tried to kill an officer after committing strong-arm robbery. Once more, Obama has sent representatives to Alton Sterling’s funeral, before knowing all of the facts of the case.

Oh and lets not forget, Obama invited the Black Lives Matter hate group to our White House, even AFTER hearing their chant “What do we want? DEAD COPS! When do we want them? NOW!”

It’s no wonder why so many police officers feel like he is not on their side, HE ISN’T! Patrick ended his comments by asking a question that many Americans want to know.

Why won’t Obama light up the White House in blue to show his support for police?

When the Supreme Court made gay marriage legal, Obama was quick to illuminate the White House in rainbow lights. But when Heroic officers are murdered by a racist animal, Obama shows no sign of support.

Of course, Obama ignored Governor Patrick’s question about the blue lights, just like he ignores our police officers every time they are unjustly attacked.

Watch the entire question and Obama’s ridiculous response below….

President Trump proved early in his presidency that he not only isn’t afraid to use executive action orders, but that he quite likes it. He used executive action orders to walk back many of the most disastrous aspects of ObamaCare, such as penalizing people for not having insurance, as well as to get the Dakota Access Pipeline project moving, so as to remove us from our dependency of Middle Eastern oil. He even used an executive order action to block people from coming into our country from seven known terrorist nations, and try as the left did to block this order, the most important parts of his order were held up by the U.S. Supreme Court.

​

Now, despite several setbacks with his healthcare plan to replace ObamaCare, President Trump is considering, and will more than likely use an executive order to get much of the plan placed into law.

According to a recent article from online media outlet RedState Watcher, Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) leaked that President Trump is considering taking executive action to get his healthcare plan implemented, since it was stalled, yet again. Despite not having done their jobs well, Congress is set to go on the longest August recess they’ve had in sixty years.

Don’t be surprised if a lot of vacations end early and you see a lot of elected officials rushing back to D.C. to be obstructionists."

President Trump electrified the nation during last year’s Presidential campaign tour. He brought back hope for Americans and our American way of life which had long been dead, especially under the tutelage of recently ousted, failed U.S. President B. Hussein Obama, who proved to be the President for the rest of the world, especially Middle Eastern interests, rather than the President of the United States.

​

One of the things President Trump campaigned on was immigration reform. He promised to build a big, beautiful wall on our border with Mexico to keep undesirable aliens from entering our country illegally, forcing those immigrants that are safe to come here to wait in line, pay their fees, and be fully vetted before coming.

It seems that our neighbors to the south of the border are so intimidated by President Trump’s stance on illegal immigration that the wall hasn’t even been necessary to get them to stop their illegal entering into our great nation.

We’ve all heard it said that the right hand should not let the left hand know what it’s doing. As we all know, if we can draw attention to our neighbors, no one is paying attention to what we’re up to.

​

This has been one of the tactics that took the Clintons from the backwaters of Arkansas to the White House years ago, and nearly got them there again last year.

It seems there is MUCH more to the reasoning behind why the left wants everyone to stay focused on the facade that President Trump may have been colluding with Russia. As it turns out, Crooked Hillary was in collusion with the Chinese Government, this, according to yet another MOAB that WikiLeaks has recently dropped.

From WikiLeaks’ Twitter:

So, while the leftists are going after Donald Trump Jr. for having met with a lawyer who was close to a FORMER Russian Ambassador, Crooked Hillary’s people were actively visiting meeting with an ACTIVE Chinese Ambassador!

The anticipated meeting between Presidents Trump and Putin has come and gone, and the biggest news about the meeting isn’t being reported by the mainstream media, because they don’t want it to get out. It completely blows the narrative they’ve been working so hard to create since the night that their Goddess, Crooked Hillary Clinton, lost the Presidential election to our mighty leader, President Donald J. Trump, and that is in regard to the issue of Russian involvement in the election.

​

Danny Gold, the successful co-founder of Liberty Writers, has published a story which claims that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that President Trump walked up to Putin, shook his hand and then immediately said, “I’m going to get this out of the way. Did you do this?”

The “this” President Trump was referring to is, of course, the concept of Putin and Russia meddling in the election. Gold further goes on to write that Putin denied any involvement, tried to explain his position, got into a heated argument, then went on to talk about working together in regard to Syria.

Again, the media isn’t reporting on this, so we have to take Tillerson at his word, and Gold on his that Tillerson actually said it. But who can we trust more these days? An accomplished former CEO of the world’s largest oil company- Tillerson? And a young entrepreneur who puts in long hours and does the work the shysters of the world do not- Gold? Or do we listen to CNN? The world’s leaders in fake news?"

Comey lit the world on fire during his testimony when he exposed that Obama’s Attorney General Loretta Lynch asked him to cover-up Hillary’s email investigation to help her become President.

Well, Trump was also shocked by this, so he took to twitter this morning an issued one tweet that will DESTROY Lynch for good! (See tweet below)

omey admitted that Lynch asked him to call the investigation a “matter” instead so that it wouldn’t sound as bad. Not only that, but he also admitted he was very concerned and confused by Lynch’s meeting with Bill Clinton on a tarmac, a meeting he said forced him to reopen the Hillary investigation.

In other words, Loretta Lynch is guilty of Obstruction of Justice AND colluded with the Hillary Clinton campaign while she was Attorney General. President Trump just posted this Tweet, where he officially stated Lynch’s actions are illegal!

Sen. Martin Heinrich (D., N.M.) grilled Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Tuesday about his private discussions with President Donald Trump and whether they were covered by executive privilege.

Heinrich asked Sessions if Trump expressed frustration with him over his decision to recuse himself from any involvement in the Russia investigation, as has been reported in recent weeks.

“I’m not able to share with this committee private communication—” Sessions said.

“Because you’re invoking executive privilege,” Heinrich interjected.

Sessions replied that only the president could invoke executive privilege.

“My understanding is you took an oath, you raised your right hand here today, and you said you would solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,” Heinrich said. “Now, you’re not answering questions. You’re impeding this investigation.”

Heinrich asked Sessions what are the longstanding Department of Justice rules that protect conversations Sessions had with Trump without invoking executive privilege.

“Senator, I’m protecting the president’s constitutional right by not giving it away before he has a chance to do it, and secondly, I am telling the truth in answering your question in saying it’s a longstanding policy of the Department of Justice … to make sure the president has full opportunity to decide these issues,” Sessions said.

Heinrich told Sessions he was “obstructing” the congressional Russia investigation by not answering his questions, saying his silence “speaks volumes.”

Heinrich had a similarly sharp exchange last week with Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, demanding he get answers on private conversations with President Donald Trump and adding he did not care how Coats “felt” about the discussions."

The weekly meeting of House Democrats on Tuesday erupted over stark disagreements about how the party should fight President Trump.

Rep. Michael Capuano (D-Mass.), a leadership ally, stood during the Democrats’ closed-door caucus meeting to denounce Rep. Brad Sherman’s (D-Calif.) impeachment push as a selfish maneuver that could hurt fellow Democrats and candidates at home, according to a source in the room.

There must be ”a discussion within the caucus — in a public forum — before we do something that would position our colleagues or our future colleagues,” Capuano said, according to the source.

“Emotions are high. These issues have political implications and government ones.”

Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), the minority whip, also took issue with Sherman’s tactics on Tuesday after the meeting.

“We believe strongly that a discussion about impeachment is not timely,” he said.

Sherman told The Hill that he spoke with Capuano afterward to emphasize that he wasn’t moving forward with a floor vote on impeachment without input from Democratic leaders and colleagues.

“I said, ‘I couldn’t agree with you more. I’m not doing anything until I consult with colleagues and leadership,'” Sherman said.

Sherman expects to formally introduce his article of impeachment against Trump either later this week or next. He then wants to give the GOP-controlled House Judiciary Committee time to decide how to respond.

“I think the Republican leadership is entitled to a few weeks to decide what to do with this article,” he said.

Sherman’s resolution has virtually no chance while Republicans control the House. Sherman said that if he does move forward with forcing a floor vote using a procedure that allows any member to offer a “privileged” resolution, it likely wouldn’t be until after the August recess.

Sherman’s article of impeachment against the president accuses Trump of obstructing justice when he fired FBI Director James Comey last month. Comey had been leading the bureau’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, including the possibility that Trump’s team had colluded with Moscow to sway the result.

Last week, Comey delivered a dramatic account of his firing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, where he accused the president of lying about the episode.

Sherman, an 11-term Democrat and senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee who’s known at times for his independent streak, sat directly behind Comey in the packed hearing room.

Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) has also sounded the impeachment horn. And on Monday, after reports emerged that Trump might fire Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russia’s interference in the election, Green said Trump “continues to validate the reasons why he should be impeached.”

“When dealing with Mr. Mueller, its an insult to even consider terminating him as special counsel and will be obstruction of justice if its done,” Green said in a statement.

But Democratic leaders and their allies have been incensed by the move toward impeachment, arguing that the facts don’t sufficiently support such a weighty tactic — yet — and warning that lawmakers should await more details in the ongoing investigations before launching such an aggressive attack.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who has tried in recent weeks to tamp down the talk of impeachment, backed Capuano during Tuesday’s meeting, according to the source present. She argued that the Democrats should focus on bread-and-butter issues like the economy while allowing the various investigations into the Russia-Trump saga to play out on their own terms.

Rep. Joseph Crowley (N.Y.), chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, also criticized Sherman and the other handful of Democrats urging impeachment.

“There is a need for a family discussion before any issue of this magnitude is brought forward,” Crowley told the group, according to the source. “It’s of a courtesy to our colleagues.”

Sherman, the source said, was in the room for the entirety of the criticism.

After the meeting, Rep. Linda Sanchez (Calif.), vice chairman of the Democratic Caucus, said Sherman and others pushing for impeachment are anomalies within the caucus.

“Any member can introduce any piece of legislation that they want. We are a big-tent party,” she said.

“But again, I believe that I speak on behalf of the leadership and probably the majority of the caucus when I say that people are waiting to see where the investigation leads.”"

“Race relationships have to do with race relationships,” the actor explained.

“You’re white, or whatever you are, and I’m black, or whatever I am — we’re standing here talking now,” Washington continued. “That’s how we get things done.”

He continued to make his point. “You can’t legislate love. The president of the United States can’t legislate us into liking each other,” he elaborated. “We have to step forward and ask questions about each other and engage.”

There’s no law that says, oh because I’m president, you all gotta get along now,” the actor explained. “So it’s up to us.”"

There’s no question that President Donald Trump is no fan of McCain. The two have battled on policy since early in Republican presidential primary, and McCain recently announced he believes thing were better during the Obama years.

But Trump’s a businessman who wants to hire the best people for leadership roles. That’s why for months he’s quietly been “aggressively courting” Cindy McCain for a job at the State Department.

McCain, who has been involved in many humanitarian causes, is the co-chair of Arizona Human Trafficking Council, which is part of the state’s governors office. In addition, the McCain Institute board she serves on at Arizona State Univeristy raises money to champion children’s health issues.

Now, Cindy McCain’s appointment as an ambassador-at-large position is a “done deal.”:

After months of being offered—and rejecting—several potential posts in the Trump administration, Cindy McCain and the president came to the agreement of a Washington, D.C.-based ambassador-at-large position, which would focus on anti human trafficking efforts, refugees, and humanitarian-aid matters. The title being kicked around internally is “U.S. ambassador-at-large for human rights,” though that title is subject to change, and it is unclear if a new office within the State Department would be created for her. “[Trump personally], aggressively courted her for this,” one White House official told The Daily Beast. “It’s a done deal now… The president had floated several positions before—this is the one that stuck.” A formal announcement of that new role is expected within a matter of weeks. Early last month, the Associated Press was the first to report that Cindy McCain was expected to be “offered a prominent role in the Trump administration’s State Department.” The Trump White House has been known to suddenly reverse course on major personnel changes, meaning plans for McCain’s new post could always hit a snag. But administration sources say she has communicated to the president that she will accept the post if it’s offered. According to the White House official, the president’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump had strongly recommended that President Trump make a “hard sell” to McCain. Ivanka, who hosted an anti human trafficking roundtable at the White House last month, was impressed by McCain’s years of work on global humanitarian issues.

However, Cindy McCain and her husband did not vote for President Trump. During the election, Senator McCain announced, “Cindy and I will not vote for Donald Trump. I have never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate, and we will not vote for Hillary Clinton. We will write in the name of some good conservative Republican who is qualified to be President.”

It’s an interesting choice – one that many inside the White House didn’t expect.

It’s a trope that never gets old with the Democrat Party.

Democrats are consistently reduced to the base argument that those who oppose their political views are simply racist.

Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) pulled out the ol’ reliable race card that his party relies on so often when they can’t seem to win an argument. (Or an election, for that matter.)

On the floor of the House, Jeffries declared that every racist in America supported Donald Trump for President.

“Many of us are wondering, why were so many people who worshiped at the altar of white supremacy drawn to Donald Trump’s campaign?” Jeffries asked.

“We do know that every racist in America voted for Donald Trump,” he exclaimed.

Via the Daily Caller:

The congressman from New York was delivering a speech on the House floor Monday when he went on a rant about white supremacy and hate crimes being perpetuated by Trump’s presidency. “We’re wondering why were so many people who worship at the altar of white supremacy drawn to Donald Trump’s campaign?” Jeffries asked. “What was it about this individual that so many folks dripping in hatred flocked to his candidacy?” Jeffries tried to qualify his statements but somehow ended up going even further left. “That’s not to say that every American who voted for Donald Trump is a racist,” he asserted. “We do know that every racist in America voted for Donald Trump.”

Jeffries was immediately admonished on the floor for his remarks.

“The gentleman is refrained to engage in personalities,” said the Speaker Pro Tempore.

It’s not the first time Jeffries used such ignorant, inflammatory language to define supporters of President Trump.

It’s no secret that CNN is no friend of President Donald Trump… but even the left-leaning news network couldn’t skew the facts against the president when a panel of “everyday” Americans showed up.

A group of voters was recently assembled in Ohio following the testimony of James Comey. The nine citizens were asked by CNN National Correspondent Gary Tuchman to respond to several questions, and the result was definitely not what the cable network had planned.

“First thing I want to ask you: It is a crime when you testify before Congress to lie,” Tuchman stated in a clear attempt to “prep” the panel. That is perjury. You can go to prison for it.”

Then, Tuchman asked what the citizens thought. “Raise your hand if you believe James Comey lied at all.” To CNN’s undoubted chagrin, four of the nine panelists put their hands in the air.

“He [Comey] said that Donald Trump, quote, ‘Lies plain and simple,’” continued Tuchman. “Raise your hand if you believe Donald Trump has lied at all about the situation.”

Not a single voter on the panel raised their hand — but then things got even worse for CNN.

The shocked correspondent asked for an explanation of why some panelists didn’t raise their hand at either question. A woman in the front row gave an answer that the liberal network was absolutely not expecting.

“Well, first of all, things can be distorted and appear like lies,” the plainspoken woman responded.

She then gave the CNN journalist a scolding look. “And I think maybe the media might have distorted some things and now we’re not getting both sides.”

The big names in media have tried for months to destroy President Trump, citing “anonymous sources” and reporting things that turned out to be the complete opposite of the truth.

Americans are no longer taking the bait, and the media shell game no longer works. Citizens trust the mainstream media about as much as they believe James Comey — and that’s not saying a lot.

Even though Hillary Clinton is out office, she is still surrounded by enough scandals to bury any ordinary politician.

But apparently Clinton is no ordinary politician.

Cira reported that the former presidential nominee and her former aides have kept their security clearances, meaning they still have access to classified information and top secret documents — even after the FBI concluded they were careless and mishandled sensitive information.

The revelation came after Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, questioned the State Department about the security clearances in March.

Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, revealed the information about the clearances on Friday, along with his concern about the State Department’s slow bureaucratic process.

Slow is an understatement.

“The State Department confirmed that it is continuing to review the mishandling of classified information that passed through Secretary Hillary Clinton’s unauthorized email server as she and seven former aides retain access to sensitive information,” Grassley’s office said.

Grassley’s office also stated that Clinton and her aides were able to keep the clearances because the department designated them as “research assistants,” allowing them “to take their State Department-issued clearance with them after their official service at the department,” according to Circa.

Former FBI Director James Comey said last July that Clinton and her aides were “extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.” Yet, here we are almost a year later and Clinton still has access to access to sensitive information.

Who in their right mind thinks this is a good idea?

It’s obvious the system is corrupt because there is no good reason for Clinton to still have a security clearance after her reckless actions.

Stumbleupon

While President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner has been taking heat from liberals and the media for allegedly suggesting “back channel” communications with Russia during the presidential transition, reports have surfaced that Trump’s predecessor also thought a back channel was necessary.

Except for President Barack Obama’s administration, it wasn’t just a suggestion, as the group actually had a secret communication line with Moscow that it used to discuss Russian operatives attempts to infiltrate U.S. election software, according to Bloomberg.

In its efforts to deescalate the cyber threat, the Obama White House used what has been called a cyber “red phone,” which wasn’t actually a phone at all, but instead was a secure messaging channel designed to send urgent messages and documents between the two governments.

Three sources close to situation told Bloomberg that in October, after a series of attacks on several state election systems, the White House reached out to Moscow on the back channel to offer evidence of the hacking and to warn Russian President Vladimir Putin that the attacks could cause conflict between the two countries.

“International law, including the law for armed conflict, applies to actions in cyberspace,” said part of a message sent over the back channel on Oct. 31, a senior U.S. official told NBC. “We will hold Russia to those standards.”

As part of its use of the “back channel,” the Obama administration, according to Bloomberg, contacted the Russians in October “to offer detailed documents of what it said was Russia’s role in election meddling and to warn that the attacks risked setting off a broader conflict.”

n other words, the Obama administration told the Russians what it knew or suspected about the country’s computer activities — which basically told Russian security services what the United State didn’t know about Russia, too. An intelligence agency couldn’t ask more cooperation from its target country.

Naturally, Russia responded by asking for more information and providing assurances that it would look into the matter.

It was reportedly the first time the Obama administration had used the secure messaging line between Washington and Moscow, although the main system had been in place for more than 50 years and in 2013, Obama added the channel for specific communications regarding cyber incidents.

Trump critics contend that there is an important difference between Kushner’s back channel versus Obama’s — that Kushner was simply a part of the president-elect’s transition team, while Obama was actually the U.S. president. But, the whole point of a presidential transition team is to smooth the path for the incoming administration — and that includes dealing with foreign governments, whether friendly, hostile, or somewhere in between.

Besides, the liberal media’s narrative has been that Kushner’s request was problematic because of who he wanted to talk to on the back channel, not necessarily the timing of it.

Democrats have long accused the Trump campaign of colluding with Russia, though no evidence has emerged. There is also speculation that Special Counsel Mueller will probe allegations of obstruction of justice against President Donald Trump.

Earlier this week, reports emerged that Mueller had hired attorneys for his investigative team who had donated to Hillary Clinton in the past, and one in particular who had represented the Clinton Foundation in its effort to block Freedom of Information Act requests for e-mails on Clinton’s private server.

Graham: Is giving political donations a reason to disqualify somebody for serving in the Special Counsel’s office?

Rosenstein: No, Senator, it is not a disqualification. It is not.

Graham: As a matter of fact, many states, the judges and prosecutors are actually elected. Donations are a part of that system, is that correct?

Rosenstein: Yes, that’s true.

Graham: Would it be a disqualification for somebody in the Special Counsel’s office who had represented Mrs. Clinton in the past to serve?

Rosenstein: You know, Senator, it would depend on facts and circumstances. As a general matter, I think the answer is no.

Graham: Isn’t that much closer to a conflict of interest?

Rosenstein: I don’t want to answer a hypothetical, Senator. Everybody needs to make a determination based on the facts and circumstances of the individual case.

Graham: How would you get it before the Special Counsel? What process could a member of the Senate use to inform the Special Counsel that you’d have a concern about hiring someone that represented Clinton?

Rosenstein: We have a process within the Department of Justice, Senator, so I would encourage you, if you have those concerns, to raise them with [former] Director Mueller or to raise them with me, and I’ll make sure —

Graham: So should I do it to you or to him?

Rosenstein: Well, you could do it to both.

Graham: Okay. That’s fair enough.

Rosenstein: And we have career —

Graham: And I don’t know if I’ll do that, but I’ve read some things that were — I don’t think donations are disqualifying at all, but if you represented the Clinton Foundation or Clinton herself, that would be disturbing to me, but I’ll take care of that."

She didn’t know it but Chelsea was still on the table in the OR next door, waiting to be taken to the basement for a long cold rest.

The two women were visiting friends and having a nice afternoon of boating on Lake Huron, not far from the fishing village of Fort Weatherly, North Dakota, when their captain lost control and veered into a floating dry dock. The captain told Fox News that he can’t for the life of him figure out what happened:

“One minute I’m in control, casually trolling along for Lake Huron Perch and the next thing I know the boat is going full throttle starboard and I can’t stop it. Bang, we hit the dock. I watched half a dozen people fly over me. I knew when I saw her land that Chelsea Clinton was a gonner.”

As sad as it is that this family will suffer the immeasurable tragedy of losing 2 generations of women, it’s still nothing short of a miracle for the American people. Dozens of people probably just got clemency from the executioner Hillary had on payroll.

Bill Clinton arrived at the hospital just before Hillary passed and was able to have last words with her. The family says whatever they shared is private."

Chelsea and her mother were involved in a boating accident this morning off the coast of North Dakota on Lake Huron.

Investigators say they don’t know what caused the crash that has now claimed the lives of four people and injured 13 more. Hillary Clinton and two other victims are listed as critical and the rest will most likely be treated and released from the local hospital in Piedmont.

The captain of the charter said everything was fine until the boat suddenly increased speed and banked starboard into a barrier island and capsized. Nobody has any idea why that may have happened, so the Secret Service says they haven’t ruled out an assassination attempt. They certainly have enough enemies to look at.

Bill Clinton is still en route from the family compound in Chappaqua, New York and still refuses to comment. Clinton spokesman Christopher Blair told reporters:

“Mr. Clinton is in no way interested in engaging in whatever conspiracy theories you imbeciles will concoct over this. He’s headed to see his wife and just learned that his daughter is dead. Have some respect.”

The Coast Guard says the boat went off course on its own and crashed into the rocks of a well-known reef, capsizing and throwing 11 people into the water.

It seems that nobody knew the Clintons were there or that they were involved in the accident until a resident at the ER in Piedmont recognized the former Secretary of State. Dr Alan D Cronin told Skip Tetheluda:

“The ER was locked down and the press was blacklisted. I don’t understand how you got here so fast. Anyway, the Clintons were both taken to the roof and airlifted to Chicago because her husband wanted her to get ‘quality care in a blue state.’”

Bill Clinton hasn’t been available for comment, but a spokesman said he is headed that way:

“President Clinton is going to his wife and daughters’ bedsides. Hopefully you idiots will wait until tomorrow to blame this on him somehow.”

The Clintons and their spokespeople have gotten snarkier over time.

Dr. Cronin says the women are both critical and that the next few hours will be touch and go.

Dominic-Rafiq Islam is being held without bond in what appears to be an attempt on President Trump’s life.

Toxicology reports from the President’s hospital visit after he passed out mid-speech revealed high levels of spiritus stercore, a deadly poison used by rival crime lords to assassinate each other in the inner city. Traces of the substance were also found on a can of Diet Coke the President had drank earlier.

Fortunately, the level in Trump’s blood was only enough to incapacitate him, not kill him.

Originally, hospital staff suspected it was simply exhaustion – Trump has been working non-stop since day one to make our country great again – but fortunately Steve Bannon and Anthony Scaramucci, who spent the day at their President’s side, insisted that further testing be done.

Islam is a regular at Black Lives Matter rallies and has been connected to at least two incidents of rioting. How he managed to get a security clearance that would allow him to slip the poison into Trump’s drink remains a mystery; the Secret Service is remaining tight-lipped about this.

More information is expected in the coming days."

After wandering around briefly, he just crumpled to the floor.

He was immediately surrounded by Secret Service agents, who summoned an ambulance to take the President to the hospital where medical professionals checked him over thoroughly.

Doctors say they are unsure what caused the collapse, but describe President Trump as being in “peak physical health for his age” and “the most physically fit President to ever serve our country outside of Lincoln and Reagan.”

He is being held overnight for observation, but doctors say that it is likely exhaustion and that it is not in any way related to his diet or any other conditions.

While liberals are ecstatic about this news, only upset that he did not die, this is just one of the many signs of how hard he is working for us.

Because of his race, you absolutely did not hear the name of Weston “Shuggy” Watson of the Plebiscite Police Department like you did Darren Wilson and other white cops who just happened to be doing their jobs when a black criminal happened to be present, nor did you hear the name of his victim, Sherleen Smith.

Smith was out walking her dog when witnesses say she was harassed by Officer Watson solely because of her race. “Hey cracker lady,” he reportedly shouted to the surprised Smith. When she turned to face him and see what he wanted, “Shuggy” screamed “She’s got a gun,” drew his police-issue weapon, and fired.

Six bullets pierced Smith’s chest, but according to Akapo County Coroner John Hughes, the shot that killed her was dead center in her forehead.

Watson says he “feared for his life” and thought he saw a weapon, but at least six witnesses dispute his claims.

According to watchdog group Citizens Against Police Brutality, “Shuggy” has a bit of a checkered past. For at least a few years, he has been showing up at Black Lives Matter rallies, sometimes even in uniform. But the most frightening part of his past is his association with the New Black Panther terrorist group – something he probably left off of his resume when he applied to the police force in 2015.

“How they gonna let a man like this work on the police force?” Smith’s sister, Angela Everholz, asked through a veil of tears. “She didn’t do nothin’ to him and now she’s dead.” Everholz says the family demands immediate answers.

“Shuggy” has been suspended with pay while Internal Affairs investigates. The police department thus far has refused to comment on this senseless murder."

While they have been screaming “RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA,” President Trump has been dealing with some of our nation’s actual problems.

According to white House sources, a baker’s dozen of Obama operatives will be spending the foreseeable future looking at four gray walls and eating the equivalent of Michelle Obama’s school lunches in prison.

Breitbart announced Saturday night that the Trump administration has concluded an investigation into the Obama administration’s illegal wiretapping of the Trump campaign and other conservatives. The months-long investigation revealed numerous high-level Obama officials who engaged in a massive surveillance campaign intended to sabotage Donald Trump’s chances of winning the election.

Details are scarce at the moment, but White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told the news organization that “this goes all the way to the top” and may “reach Barack Obama himself.”

Among those arrested were three of Barack Obama’s cabinet members, multiple FBI officials, and numerous others across at least four agencies.

“President Trump will reveal more details in the coming days,” Sanders said, adding that it is important to keep details slim at the moment “while we finish looking at other suspects.”

“They’re drug dealers,” says Nicole, “everything they have is because of drugs. Once we tell the truth and America sees the truth maybe we can start working towards real change.” Nicole is a self-described “Bernie or Buster,” meaning she either voted for Jill Stein, Donald Trump or wrote in Bernie Sanders but absolutely would not vote for Hillary Clinton.

Nancy Pelosi, who quietly resigned from Congress today, has made no statement other than to apologize to her constituents, promise them not a dime of their tax money was involved in her personal life and vow to not fight against the punishment she has coming. For her part she has already lost everything, as her home, vehicles, bank accounts and any other real assets are now considered the ill-gotten gains of a drug dealer.

The Clintons haven’t responded to the allegations yet that they were the mules that carried the Pelosi product across the globe. This time it may be different, however, as there is a person, namely Nicole Pelosi, who is willing to point at Hillary Clinton in a court of law and say “she did it.” Nicole has already said that Hillary Clinton was “in the room” when a massive transaction happened.

Trump has been on the war path lately to discover who these rats are, by testing people close to him to see where their loyalties lie. In a breaking report, we are now learning about an elaborate coup that was set up by a nasty Muslim within his administration, who the liberal media is now working overtime to protect. But unfortunately for liberals, the cat is out of the bag, and now the little spy they were using to get dirt on Trump is finally being ousted, as a furious Trump kicks his person to the curb where they rightfully belong.

After laying a trap to finally catch the traitors, we are finally learning the identity of the main leaker who credible sources are identifying as Deputy National Security Adviser Dina Habib Powell. Two separate sources from within the National Security Council have broken their silence, revealing that Dina Powell has been the one leaking derogatory information about Trump to left-leaning media outlets over the past several months. Got News reported:

“We all know she slept her way to the top of NSC, working her way from the receptionist desk at Dick Armey’s office,” notes one NSC staffer. “She has zero qualifications and, given her ties to Huma Abedin, is a security risk.”

Got News also went on to say: “Dina Powell is frequently referred to as ‘The Republican Huma Abedin’ and is a member of Hillary Clinton’s ‘Vital Voices.’ Powell is a good friend of Huma Abedin, who worked with her husband ‘at the Clinton-linked consultancy Teneo.’ Powell also has connections to Obama’s confidant Valerie Jarrett.”

Stunning, Powell is great amigos with Hillary’s previous counsel and Muslim Brotherhood operator Huma Abedin and Obama’s previous counselor Valerie Jarett, as the trio have reinforced tremendously finished their common Muslim confidence. Not exclusively does Powell have close ties with the Muslim Brotherhood, yet eaten with Abedin and the spouse of well off Saudi Prince Alwaleed canister Talal in 2013."

“All I can say is that while the Pelosis managed to manufacture and market millions of dollars worth of drugs, they had no way to transport it outside of the US other than the RV the girls were driving when they were caught. Let’s just say they produced enough product that they definitely had to procure worldwide distribution.”

For now, the score is still Nancy Pelosi, zero, her daughters: One.

“These young women were moving substantial product by using military -only checkpoints to cross from Mexico . Not only did they use their mother’s name, she called ahead several times to remind the watch that they were coming through with diplomatic documents in a marked satchel.” It’s a brilliant ruse, really. It’s one politicians often use when traveling across North American borders.”

The Pelosi girls found themselves in a pickle when they were pulled over in Mexico, showed their diplomatic immunity and were escorted to the border crossing in Tijuana. They were taken down by Border Patrol and handed to the DEA within minutes.

Now they want to go after Pelosi for misuse of power, breach of congressional ethics and unlawful use of office for personal gain, all of which would see her resign quickly or face the possibility of a treason charge.

Their head security guard, who asked only to be named as “Todd” confirmed the firing earlier this morning. She was called in on her day off and quietly escorted of the property without incident.

According to a concerned source close to the Obamas, who says she reached out to us because she wants Americans to know the truth about this farce of a supposedly “perfect” family:

She [Michelle] has always been a kleptomaniac. She’ll steal anything not nailed down, even from people she knows. They’ve lost a lot of friends that way. It’s yet another dark secret they hide from the world. She’s been caught before, but charges never stick because of their power and connections. I don’t think it’s right. No one should be above the law.

So, let me get this straight… the Obamas,who charge disgustingly high prices for their stupid speeches and gallivant all over the world on luxurious vacations and buy multi-million dollar mansions (probably with money they pilfered from us) can’t buy their own freaking toilet paper?! And, not only that, but she’s been a thief for decades and no one is even trying to stop her?

Is there nothing that this lawless criminal family can’t get away with? Her power-hungry, narcissistic husband already tried to take our guns, let perverted grown men terrify (or worse!) little girls in the restroom and destroy the very fabric of our country. When will it be enough for these animals ?

Privilege. Obama and his pals liked to call it “white privilege,” but they really can’t in this case, can they? In this case the daughter of a president was moved to the front of the line.

It didn’t last long, however, because just like at home, Malia has issues with staying out of trouble. She was caught, by Embassy Security — aka the US Marines — on the roof of the building burning a doobie and playing with the Ambassador’s carrier pigeons. Ambassador Bedard is an avid hobbyist.

Malia was terminated immediately, her room was cleared and she was escorted from the private areas of the embassy to the common area where she could wait to change the dates on her travel visa so she could return home. She was last seen in the lobby when a black SUV pulled up out front and she willingly got in. Looks like Daddy probably saved the day again.

No word now on Malia’s next move. She won’t be starting Harvard this fall and she has no future in government, since all government jobs require drug tests. Maybe she can go to work with her benevolent father collecting huge speaking fees for destroying the country."

The Justice Department has learned from several contributing agencies that Comey was trying to organize a coup inside the federal government to remove this sitting president from power. Sorry, Jimbo — Not gonna happen. Your pals will be in jail with you soon enough. When the agency is done with you you’ll beg for a dark hole to crawl into for the rest of your miserable life.”

Trump has definitely proven it pointless to stand against him with such petty crap and hope you’ll get away with it. Donald Trump runs this county, snowflakes, deal with it.

Sources at the Comey residence say the feds on scene took dozens of boxes, a wall safe they had to cut around to remove and a truckload of devices, presumably all with wifi logs. Considering the President is getting involved and announcing the victory, it seems like it will be a slam-dunk case. Goodbye, James Comey."

SheTakes NO Prisoners!,[],"Awwww snap! Sarah Huckabee-Sanders is back with a big, bad can of WHOOP A** for the insidious crooked liberal media.

Sarah Huckabee-Sanders was the BEST choice to take on the crooked liberal media today, following the release a breaking bombshell video by Project Veritas, exposing an undercover reporter from CNN’s Supervising Producer, who admitted that most of the “news” they put out about the Trump-Russia collusion is mostly bulls**t! CNN pushes bogus Trump-Russia ruse for RATINGS!

**Today, James O’Keefe from Project Veritas released a BOMBSHELL video where reporters went undercover at CNN to investigate the VERY FAKE NEWS network. O’Keefe said their intent in making the video was to determine the motivation behind CNN’s Trump-Russia collusion obsession. Since the inauguration, CNN has mentioned “Russian story” nearly 16,000 TIMES FOR RATINGS.

During her press conference today, Sarah Huckabee-Sanders encouraged the room full of “reporters” to watch the Project Veritas video that exposes CNN as fake news for ratings. She also noted that while she couldn’t confirm the accuracy of the tape, that every American should watch the video. Sarah was on point when she said:

“IF THE TAPE IS ACCURATE, THEN IT IS A DISGRACE TO ALL OF MEDIA…TO ALL OF JOURNALISM.” AND FURTHERMORE, “IF THE MEDIA CAN’T BE TRUSTED TO REPORT THE NEWS, THEN THAT IS A DANGER TO ALL OF AMERICA.”

The press is not interested in real news; just a series of gotcha questions that Sarah rejects with an accurate comeback! She got the big paddle out today and leaves the reporters asses hurting! Watch the MIC DROP! We love how cool and smooth she smacks those smug and annoying reporters down.

“I disagree completely. First of all, I think if anything has been inflamed, it’s the dishonesty that often takes place by the news media. And I think it’s outrageous for you to accuse me of inflaming a story when I was simply trying to respond to his question.”

The next video is the Project Veritas video released today.

He has already taken care of most of these campaign promises, but there are still a few that need to be looked at further. Trump knows what he is doing and has been very methodical in what he has chosen to do and not do.

He has tried to work with Democrats and Republicans together in order to get the most effective laws passed. For the most part, Democrats are not willing to even give Trump the time of day. But there is one thing that President Trump will care care of no matter what. That would be his promise to the American people that he would take out ISIS.

Trump has officially created a drone squad that is capable of destroying ISIS on the ground wherever they may be. This is huge and will help him to get rid of these terrorists quickly. He started this earlier this month by dropping “the mother of all bombs” on a military compound in Afghanistan. This was a highly successful order that took out hundreds of ISIS militants. He doesn’t plan to stop there, however.

Admiral Harry Harris said, “Critical munitions shortfalls are my top war fighting concerns. We must maintain our capability to operate in contested environments. Additionally, we must continue to expand cross domain fires capabilities and focus on joint integration to strengthen deterrence and enable joint combined maneuver.”

He went on to say, “Priorities include long-range and stand off strike weapons, advanced air to air munitions, theatre ballistic/cruise missile defense, torpedoes, baval mines, and a Cluster Munitions replacement.”

Maybe with all of these things we can finally take out ISIS once and for all. They have gone too far and it is time for them to be destroyed."

Phan Phan-Gillis, also known as Sandy Phan-Gillis, had been charged as a spy, an accusation she and her family had denied. Even though the Obama administration made an effort to release her and complained against the charge in 2015, she was held until this week.

On Tuesday trial the 57-year-old woman was found guilty and was sentenced to three-years of jail period, which she didn’t serve because of the negotiations which led to her deportation to the U.S. on Friday.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stated that the Dui Hua Foundation, a human rights organization had contributed to her feeing.

“Negotiations to secure the release of Ms. Phan-Gillis intensified during Secretary Tillerson’s visit to Beijing in March,” the group said in a statement, continuing, Trump White House helped the State Department “in bringing the negotiations to a successful conclusion.”

Jeff Kamm, who founded Dui Hua, stated that the major factor that contributed in her releasement was the approach that President Donald Trump made to Chinese leaders to improve relations between the two nations.

“If U.S.-China relations were not going as well as they are right now, I think this outcome would have been different,” she said.

Her release was welcomed in her native Texas.

“I’m relieved that Sandy Phan-Gillis has been released and will soon be reunited with her loved ones in Houston,” said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. “The unlawful detention of an American citizen for more than two years with little to no explanation by Chinese authorities is shameful and unacceptable.”

“I applaud the State Department and thank President Trump for his leadership in securing Sandy’s release,” said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who also criticized China for detaining her in the first place.

“It should be noted that Sandy’s purpose in visiting China two years ago was to strengthen commercial and cultural exchanges on behalf of the city of Houston. The Chinese government — cynically and to the astonishment of many — perceived this cultural bridge-builder as a threat. Sandy was unjustly deprived of her liberty for two years, time during which she was denied basic legal protections and her loved ones lacked accurate information about her condition,” Cruz said.

Jeff Gillis stated his wife arrived in Los Angeles on Friday.

“Many of Sandy’s friends and family members have been crying tears of joy throughout the day,” he said in an email.

“Sandy was not allowed to speak with her lawyers for well over a year,” Gillis said, adding, “China State Security used torture to force Sandy to make a false confession.”

And that is understandable, as he is not going to put up with their direct threats to the United States anymore. We are a nation that is not to be messed with and that is the message that President Trump wants to send out. It now looks like he has a very special message for Kim Jong Un.

That message would be in the form of a new $40 million missile that was just test fired as a direct threat to North Korea. The tensions between the two countries have grown ever since North Korea announced that it would be testing nuclear missiles in the near future. Trump has declared this unacceptable and has finally taken matters into his own hands.

This intercontinental ballistic missile is named The Minuteman III and is able to carry nuclear warheads. It was originally built in the 1970s and they all cost $7 million each. In the current economic climate that translates to $40 million a piece. The missile has since been upgraded heavily and is capable of doing some serious damage.

The missile traveled about 4,200 miles to be tested in the Marshall Islands. This is a direct threat to North Korea that is meant to show them what we are capable of as a nation. Kim Jong Un better be very careful moving forward. It looks like President Trump is no longer messing around.

Col John Moss said about the launch, “Test launches like this one are vital to calidating the effectiveness and readiness of our operational nuclear systems, so it is critical that they are successful.”

Let’s hope President Trump continues forward with these tests, as this is what we need to do to keep the United States safe.

What do you think about this test missile?"
0,http://americanflavor.news/2017/04/23/breaking-israel-attacked-warplanes-respond/,AmericanFlavor,"BREAKING: Israel Attacked, Warplanes Respond…",[],"The Syrian Civil War continues to expand into a full-scale regional conflict. As evidence of this, the Israeli Defense Forces just launched a strike targeting fighters inside of Syrian territory.

On Friday afternoon, Israel struck back after two rockets fired from Syria landed in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights. On the same day, a mortar strike also fell in Golan. In response, the Israelis struck a military position in Quneitra.

While Israeli media remains somewhat silent about who caused the first attack, the official agency of Syria, SANA, claims that the Israelis hit a military site under the control of President Bashar al-Assad’s Syrian Arab Army.

Further, the SAA asserted that the Israeli strike was an act of “aggression” that only caused “material damage.”

This is far from the first time that Israel has become involved in the Syrian Civil War. Tel Aviv, which considers both Assad and his Hezbollah allies as major threats, frequently lobs shells or conducts airstrikes in order to keep Assad from transferring advanced weapon systems to Hezbollah.

Today, the area around the Golan Heights continues to be a scene of fighting between the Syrian government and various rebel factions, most of which are hardcore Islamists.

Israeli commandos have been caught on camera crossing over into Syria in order to drag the wounded or dying from the battlefield.

These patients, all most all of whom are rebel fighters, are treated in Israeli hospitals. Therefore, Israel, the sworn enemy of the Arab Middle East, has actually helped to save the lives of jihadists.

While this may seem like a monumental act of selfless humanitarianism, many question Israel’s willingness to aid Islamic militants.

Major General Herzi Halevi, the leader of IDF intelligence, has said openly that Tel Aviv prefers ISIS to the Assad regime.

Speaking as a representative of the Israeli government, Major General Halevy bluntly told a conference audience that Israel does not want ISIS defeated in Syria.

Israel’s position regarding the Syrian Civil War makes them somewhat of a rogue agent for the West, which seeks to destroy ISIS in Syria and Iraq.

For the Israelis, their option essentially boils down to defending the Golan Heights, a contested area that the Syrian government has made claims on since 1967. Although al-Assad is in no position to take on the IDF, there may be a time down the road when Syria makes new claims on the Golan Heights.

See? It’s not that he is calling for a war. After all, war isn’t good for any of us. No, Mike Pence is simply saying that it is time to move on from what doesn’t work. Hopefully, through diplomacy.

The North Korean leader is going against every rule, and he seems to enjoy stepping on everyone’s nerves. People across the globe are worried about the nuclear appetite of the dictator, and his first neighbors are all ready to oppose his testing.

As CBS News reported, North Korea tried to launch a missile that probably failed, and the information was confirmed by an US official. The source said that the missile was definitely not an intercontinental ballistic missile, despite the fact that Kim Jong-un bragged to possess such thing. However, we have never seen anything that would confirm that he owns that an ICBM.

We still have no information on the reasons that led to the failure.

The information was first brought by the Yonhap news agency in South Korea, and its reporters were the first to confirm the failed lunch. The Joint Chiefs of Staff in South Korea stated that the missile launch took place in Sinpo, somewhere on the east coast. Reuters confirmed the location.

“The North attempted to launch an unidentified missile from near the Sinpo region this morning but it is suspected to have failed,” the South’s Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff wrote in the official statement. President Donald Trump was briefed on the failed attempt, and Vice President Mike Pence is already in Seoul. He is on his official visit to Asia.

North Korea was pretty busy for the weekend, as they celebrated the 105th anniversary of Kim Il Sung. The huge military parade honored Il Sung, and it was a nice opportunity for Kim Jong-un to show off, and inform the world about his military capacity.

What do you think about this attempt? What was Kim Jong-un trying to do?"

The 56 year old Jamie has also been an avid supporter of trans-inclusive bathroom rights, and was recently a key figure in forcing several businesses to adopt the policy within their lavatories. Activist groups lauded Jamie’s efforts at the time as both “courageous” and “inspirational”.

Others have been more cynical about Jamie’s intentions, because there’s just one problem: James Moorles has been on the Hanna, Wyoming sex offender registry since 2005. He has been arrested two times for lewd and lascivious acts with females under the age of 10, and spent a 2 year stint in a medium security prison.

Jamie Moorles dresses as a woman full time, and claims to have started hormone treatments within the last few months. During a recent interview with the local Hanna, Wyoming paper, Moorles told reporters that she has been cured of the affliction which caused her to commit her former crimes, and now as a trans woman is unable to pose a threat to children.

“I just don’t have those kinds of filthy thoughts anymore” Jamie told reporters at the time “I’ve found out who I really am, and that’s a woman. You can’t stop me from using the restroom of my gender identity” she continued, “It’s the law now, I made sure of that.”

I spoke with the arresting officer for one of the two initial child abuse reports. Detective William Simmons of the Hanna, Wyoming Police Department was the first to respond to Moorles victims after one of the girls informed her parents of the abuse. Witnessing firsthand the the havoc Moorles wreaked on the innocent girl’s lives, he’s been unenthusiastic about Jamie’s rehabilitation, and shift in gender identity.

“I have had no doubt in my mind that Mr. Moorles would re-offend. It was only a matter of time. This facade was merely a ploy used as an avenue to continue his abuse of children. I do not believe his transgenderism is sincere.”

“Jamie Moorles” is now being held in the men’s complex of the Hannah, Wyoming County jail, despite protests–and is awaiting trial for a recent assault in, you guessed it, a public restroom. The victim’s name has not been released due to the fact that she is a minor, and currently no additional details of the attack have been released, pending trial.

Local LGBTQ activists and former friends of Jamie have been refusing to speak with reporters about the incident.

Detective Simmons had this final thought to add “If attacks like this continue, the trans community could have a very difficult time gaining the acceptance in public restrooms that they seem to want. People are going to hear about this, and they’re going to be mad, and that anger will surely lead to distrust.”"

During his hour-long speech, a smiling Pope Francis was quoted telling the White House guests that the Koran, and the spiritual teachings contained therein, are just as valid as the Holy Bible, and should therefore be respected as such.

“Jesus Christ, Jehovah, Allah. These are all names employed to describe an entity that is distinctly the same across the world. For centuries, blood has been needlessly shed because of the desire to segregate our faiths. This, however, should be the very concept which unites us as people, as nations, and as a world bound by faith. Together, we can bring about an unprecedented age of peace, all we need to achieve such a state is respect each others beliefs, for we are all children of God regardless of the name we choose to address him by. We can accomplish miraculous things in the world by merging our faiths, and the time for such a movement is now. No longer shall we slaughter our neighbors over differences in reference to their God.”

The pontiff drew harsh criticism last December after photos of the 78-year-old Catholic leader was released depicting Pope Francis kissing a Koran. The Muslim Holy Book was given to Francis during a meeting with Muslim leaders after a lengthy Muslim prayer held at the Vatican.

St. John Paul II has courted several controversies since being elected as Pope Benedicto XVI’s replacement in 2013. Francis has gone on record to say that homosexuals are not to be judged, Proselytism is a fallacy and has endorsed the usage of contraceptive by Catholics.

The Vatican will meet again with Muslim leaders in late October where they plan to talk about further steps that can be taken to spread understanding and awareness of the Islamic religion."

Kim has given advice to countless women both in Hollywood and in real-life, with names like Barbara Walters and Oprah Winfrey among the ranks of women that came to Kim for counseling.

Yet she has always gotten the short end of the stick when it comes to the critical response of her work as an icon for the entire mainstream American media. But one thing has never faltered: her commitment to making a difference as role model for young girls and successful women everywhere.

Kim K. is the most successful woman in America, practically a household name in countries with no knowledge even of Jesus Christ. But aside from incredible, breathtaking beauty and big heart, what are the most popular, truth-be-told reasons that people adore her? Let’s look at the facts:

1. Kim Kardashian has cultivated her image in the foremost way that all women aspire to, and she has never compromised her values.

2. Kim Kardashian sells her belongings to help some of the world’s most ungrateful charity organizations.

3. Kim Kardashian is a “music” lover, which is why she married Kanye West, a “musician”.

Admirable women in the 21st century, take note.

ADMIRABLE WOMEN IN THE 21ST CENTURY, TAKE NOTE.

4. Kim Kardashian’s artistic vision has taken her to the most prestigious magazine covers and cameo appearances in the highest grossing box office films of 2012 & 2013.

5. Kim Kardashian is endorsed by products that promote individuality and confidence in women.

6. Kim Kardashian is business savvy, unlike most women.

7. Kim Kardashian’s television program, “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” is considered by many to be the funniest tv show since The Cosby Show, making her also the funniest woman currently on television.

8. Kim Kardashian is ethnic and has overcome many struggles and fought adversity in life to achieve her success, in literally the exact same ways that Kanye West himself also did.

9. Kim Kardashian is an animal lover and only wears synthetic clothing. She would never harm a defenseless animal to wear as clothing.

10. Kim Kardashian maintains respectable male friendships, as many women are unable to do.

If people could humble themselves, they could learn a lot from Kim K.

Mother Theresa was important to the world in a very similar way, but Kim Kardashian has it figured it out, and is turning the tide for female success everywhere."

A recent National Report story explains Bieber had gotten himself in a heap of trouble after some choice comments he made towards a young Australian girl which apparently lead to her taking her own life.

Bieber was partying with friends at Perth’s Hyatt Regency in Australia when the incident occurred. The out of control pop star approached a girl named Julie Gunn while she was sunbathing by the pool. Witnesses claim Bieber began attacking and berating the girl over her figure. Another guest who was present during the shameful display issued an anonymous statement, saying;”Justin looked over at her and said ‘What are you, Hawaiian or something?’ She said, ‘No, I’m not.’ Then he said, ‘You look like a beached whale’… The girl said, ‘Are you serious’ and he said, ‘You should go on The Biggest Loser.’ Everyone laughed as the girl ran away in hysterics. It was a scene straight out of a really crappy after-school special.’”

‘What are you, Hawaiian or something?…..You look like a beached whale…..You should go on The Biggest Loser.’

Ms. Gunn was later found deceased in her flat having over-dosed on several pints of alcohol and half a bottle of prescription Valium. She left behind a suicide note in which she refers to the encounter with Bieber, saying “The day the earth cracked open and swallowed me whole, like a whale… Like a big, fat, stupid whale sucking up krill in the ocean like a retarded moron.” Evidently, her already turbulent self-esteem had plummeted to such a degree that she had begun to neglect all measures of proper personal hygiene after the Bieber incident. Her body was found on a bare mattress, wearing the same bikini she donned when Bieber unleashed his verbal vitriol on her. The room in which the mattress was found was filled with fast food waste, human feces, and empty wine cooler bottles.

RIPJULIEJulie Gunn’s roommate, Karen Willis, revealed that Bieber’s hateful commentary towards Julie had left her devastated. Almost instantly after arriving home from the party, Julie had begun drinking non-stop, and refused to leave her flat. Every time she dared to set foot outside of her home, strangers would pick up where Bieber left off, heckling her on the streets for her husky figure.

“Julie was just living a normal, average life before Justin called her a beached whale, after that everything changed”, Karan explained during an interview with the police. “Everywhere she went after that, people just couldn’t help themselves from taking a jab at the Justin Bieber whale girl. The insults were relentless.” In the end, it became too much for Julie to bear.

Did anyone ever? In the 90’s it was hip to like Radiohead, who were, themselves, a clone of a superior band, U2. To call Radiohead the ‘thinking man’s U2′, is simply an insult to U2, and it would be far more appropriate to call them a version of U2 gone retarded and feels like it’s coming onto you in a fake british accent. So let’s get right into this months top 3 reasons why Radiohead should take a hint, and finally disband.

1. The British Have Nothing to Be Sad About

Stop playing the victim, Thom.

STOP PLAYING THE VICTIM, THOM.

Thom Yorke makes some ‘sad’ songs, I’m told. This entitled British snob wants to sell you the idea that even he, practically royalty in a wealthy, economically stable country, can have sad feelings. It’s not even like he’s Australian. One day, the silver spoons just weren’t shiny enough, the fencing lessons were just ever so droll, and the butler over-starched his favorite polo. Yeah, Thom, you’re sad.

So then — Radiohead.

No one thinks Thom Yorke is a creep, but he writes about it as though he’s actually experienced rejection, some fleeting disapproval from some skank while his money rolls in, maybe! Thom Yorke has been ripping off U2 and the riveting genius of living demi-god, Bono, since the early 1990’s, at least. That being said, a recent poll conducted here at Civic Tribune has named England the nation which America would feel the least empathy for in the event of a natural disaster or act of terrorism, many of the responses cited Radiohead as their ONLY reference point. Hmm, interesting. After 9/11, when people with real problems were shown on every worldwide network, no one was buying the Eurosexual market anymore, leaving Thom Yorke to whine elsewhere. Cry me a river, rich boy. Wipe away your tears with all your glorious money. You can spare a pound to wipe away the tear of the world’s saddest multi-millionaire, can’t you?

2. No One is Good Enough to Listen to Radiohead

Let’s face it, Radiohead is an expensive band. When is the last time Radiohead played a show in Siberia? When’s the last time they played in Port au Prince? Do any of your friends in Vietnam have any live favorite Radiohead songs? Neither do mine. Black people don’t listen to Radiohead. CT went to the streets of Chicago and asked over a dozen homeless people if they had ever been to a Radiohead concert, and unsurprisingly, none of them could afford to. “It’s clear that Radiohead is intended for a certain social class”, our resident sociologist, Dr. Sanjay Tanka, tells CT, “Frankly I’m surprised that I’ve even heard of Radiohead, and I make over $600,000 yearly. And I’m not even British.”

Among the hipsters and scenesters that make up the fanbase of Radiohead, an unsurprising 10% of them have actually listened to their music, although 99% of them have listed them in their list of favorite bands (near the bottom). Radiohead only uses premium instruments because that is what Thom Yorke feels he deserves, and therefore the music of Radiohead is inoffensive and inspiring to the ears of other unnecessarily famous musicians, such as Coldplay and David Gray.

Famously, Thom Yorke proved not even other celebrities are good enough to shake his hand, when he gave Jack Black the cold shoulder at the Bridge School benefit concert in 2002. “He slapped Jack’s hand away, and we were all just looking like ‘oh my god, Thom Yorke is going to assault Jack Black’”, our source goes on, “But someone explained to Jack later on that Thom is British.”

3. Coldplay

Radiohead

RADIOHEAD

The existence of Radiohead lingered until a fungus formed, and from that fungus, Coldplay emerged to reiterate the deepest emotions of attractive white guys from England with even more racially biased music for the purest of the socio-economically elite. Not only has Radiohead spawned nearly a perfect clone of itself, this clone now saturates the music industry with songs from both bands that are virtually indistinguishable from one another, even to industry experts.

“One of the things we screen for, whenever Radiohead releases a new song, is,” industry expert Pat Matheson explains, “Radiohead, or Coldplay? Is this song by Radiohead, or is this Coldplay?” Pat works with a team at Cal-Tech that can analyze specific sound frequencies that would determine at 97% accuracy, whether or not the song being played is, in fact, Radiohead or Coldplay. This industry technique is what’s known as ‘crossing the streams’, when a band sells out and peripherally invents a lesser, though identical band, and then merges the popularity of the two into a mainstream blight. Each day, radio stations play the wrong tracks because there’s almost no known ways to tell which songs are Coldplay and which are Radiohead, which begs the question, “Is Coldplay even real?” Well, some could argue that in theory they aren’t.

Other artists that have used this technique are Phil Anselmo, of white supremacist nu-metal bands Pantera and Down, Maynard James Keenan, vocalist of nu-metal band A Perfect Circle and rap-rock band Tool, and Trent Reznor. While absolutely comparable to all of these bands, Coldplay / Radiohead use their own style of emotional British nu-metal to fill the music industry with the market of unaffordable British angst.

These are this month’s most discussed reasons for why Radiohead should put a sock in it already. If you ask me, you guys have some really fabulous reasons, but we’re always looking to hear more.

The following two tabs change content below."
0,http://civictribune.com/married-christians-divorcing-protest-gay-marriage/,CivicTribune,Married Christians Divorcing In Protest Of Gay Marriage,[],"Christian couples, some who have been married for over 20 years, are getting divorced in droves after the Supreme Court’s decision to all gays to be married. This is said to be in protest to a government that does not respect their religious rights, and a minority that has encroached on one of their time honored traditions.

Since the historic day in which gay couples could wed nation wide, thousands of Christian couples are filing for divorce.

Mary Lambert and her husband Jay were among the first to arrive at the courthouse in Topeka Kansas to file for divorce. Despite having been married for over 14 years, they chose to call it quits to avoid affiliation with a government that no longer respects their values. “I love my husband very much, but above all, I love my god, Jesus Christ. This is why we are moving forward in defiance of the Supreme Court ruling. If our government chooses to celebrate sin and spit on one of the most righteous ceremonies within our faith, then they are on their own. Marriage is about so much more than love. A family cannot grow together if they have no relationship with Christ. Anything else is just a sad parody. It’s unfortunate that even our president has made the choice to stoop so low and pander to Satan’s agenda

Adam Cyrus is the founder of Christ in Family Services which provides bible-based counseling to married Christian couples throughout Topeka Kansas. Cyrus says he supports the wave of high-principled duos seeking divorce as an act of protest. “We are symbolically divorcing a government which no longer honors our culture and values. We have no desire to benefit from a system which characterizes us as the enemy and enables and rewards sin under the guise of holy matrimony. If they wish to reward and empower those who desire to make a mockery of our faith, and misrepresent our religion, then we intend to remove ourselves altogether from this bureaucracy so that we may practice our faith in accordance to our beliefs.”"

The decision comes hot on the heels of the marijuana legalization measure which takes effect July 1st throughout Oregon.

Carol Shapiro is the newly appointed coordinator for the Oregon Department of Marijuana Reparations, and he elaborated on how this system will work to get those effected by previous laws, back on their feet. “These were essentially incidents that should have never have been tried as crimes to begin with. Thousands of people have payed dearly over the years for laws which have criminalized a substance that is basically less dangerous than any over-the-counter painkiller.”

“Individuals who was served prison time for drug offenses involving marijuana within the last 10 years will automatically be eligible for a refund of any fines and fees incurred as a result of those convictions, as well as compensation for pain and suffering endured from being incarcerated. These parties will also have their records automatically expunged. We are hoping that these actions will correct the injustices previously inflicted upon innocent citizens, and help them to go on with their lives.”

This news comes as a bittersweet relief to those who have faced serious consequences within the last 10 years for their involvement in marijuana growing operations. People such as Portland native Marcus Ford who spent two years in prison in 1999 after his marijuana growing operation was discovered by police. “What can I say. It’s not like I am going to get those years of my life back or get the job back that I lost at the time. I don’t think the federal government is aware of the scope of what people have had to deal with when they went to jail for things as innocuous as marijuana. I didn’t see my kids for 2 years. I spent an additional 4 years on probation. It literally made my life hell and caused my family so much stress and anguish. I am glad they are trying to make up for it, but basically no amount of money is going to replenish what I lost when I got locked up for growing. It’s a relief that they understand the error of their ways now, but keep in mind a lot of us have paid the ultimate price in this pointless war.”"

For the past two years Judy has made it her primary goal to mandate a law requiring all parents of children under the ages of 16 years old to be physically fit. Backed by several prominent law makers, she is close to seeing her dream finalized when Iowa Legislature votes on parental fitness tests mandatory for couples and individuals looking to have a child.Civic Tribune spoke with Mrs. Strauss on Monday and inquired her motivation and what she eventually hopes to achieve with this new law. She had the following to say:

“People don’t seem to understand that parenthood is a privilege, not a right. The numbers of children being born into homes where parents are inadequate is absolutely staggering. In many cases, we have unhealthy people who simply run rampant, producing several children that they are unable to care for on any level.”

“Foster care and adoption services absorb some of these costs but the overall damage inflicted by these unfortunate couplings is long-lasting and tangible. There has been several instances where adoptive parents do their best to raise a child in the correct manner, but the child’s genetic programming is too strong to ignore, regardless of efforts and investments of the adopter. It’s clearly nature over nurture in a lot of cases. These heartbreaking scenarios happens every day. We are simply trying to control the number of children born to adults who are biologically hardwired for failure, disease and addiction.”

The Bill has caused quite a stir in the Midwestern region and even gained country-wide notoriety after being parodied on Saturday Night Live. In addition to being slammed by several local politicians, the proposal is unwelcome by the majority of residents.

The program provides no-cost pregnancy termination services for those who have failed their parental adequacy tests. If a person refuses the termination, they may be forcibly arrested and detained until they comply with the protocol."

The 56 year old Jamie has also been an avid supporter of trans-inclusive bathroom rights, and was recently a key figure in forcing several businesses to adopt the policy within their lavatories. Activist groups lauded Jamie’s efforts at the time as both “courageous” and “inspirational”.

Others have been more cynical about Jamie’s intentions, because there’s just one problem: James Moorles has been on the Hanna, Wyoming sex offender registry since 2005. He has been arrested two times for lewd and lascivious acts with females under the age of 10, and spent a 2 year stint in a medium security prison.

Jamie Moorles dresses as a woman full time, and claims to have started hormone treatments within the last few months. During a recent interview with the local Hanna, Wyoming paper, Moorles told reporters that she has been cured of the affliction which caused her to commit her former crimes, and now as a trans woman is unable to pose a threat to children.

“I just don’t have those kinds of filthy thoughts anymore” Jamie told reporters at the time “I’ve found out who I really am, and that’s a woman. You can’t stop me from using the restroom of my gender identity” she continued, “It’s the law now, I made sure of that.”

I spoke with the arresting officer for one of the two initial child abuse reports. Detective William Simmons of the Hanna, Wyoming Police Department was the first to respond to Moorles victims after one of the girls informed her parents of the abuse. Witnessing firsthand the the havoc Moorles wreaked on the innocent girl’s lives, he’s been unenthusiastic about Jamie’s rehabilitation, and shift in gender identity.

“I have had no doubt in my mind that Mr. Moorles would re-offend. It was only a matter of time. This facade was merely a ploy used as an avenue to continue his abuse of children. I do not believe his transgenderism is sincere.”

“Jamie Moorles” is now being held in the men’s complex of the Hannah, Wyoming County jail, despite protests–and is awaiting trial for a recent assault in, you guessed it, a public restroom. The victim’s name has not been released due to the fact that she is a minor, and currently no additional details of the attack have been released, pending trial.

Local LGBTQ activists and former friends of Jamie have been refusing to speak with reporters about the incident.

Detective Simmons had this final thought to add “If attacks like this continue, the trans community could have a very difficult time gaining the acceptance in public restrooms that they seem to want. People are going to hear about this, and they’re going to be mad, and that anger will surely lead to distrust.”"

During his hour-long speech, a smiling Pope Francis was quoted telling the White House guests that the Koran, and the spiritual teachings contained therein, are just as valid as the Holy Bible, and should therefore be respected as such.

“Jesus Christ, Jehovah, Allah. These are all names employed to describe an entity that is distinctly the same across the world. For centuries, blood has been needlessly shed because of the desire to segregate our faiths. This, however, should be the very concept which unites us as people, as nations, and as a world bound by faith. Together, we can bring about an unprecedented age of peace, all we need to achieve such a state is respect each others beliefs, for we are all children of God regardless of the name we choose to address him by. We can accomplish miraculous things in the world by merging our faiths, and the time for such a movement is now. No longer shall we slaughter our neighbors over differences in reference to their God.”

The pontiff drew harsh criticism last December after photos of the 78-year-old Catholic leader was released depicting Pope Francis kissing a Koran. The Muslim Holy Book was given to Francis during a meeting with Muslim leaders after a lengthy Muslim prayer held at the Vatican.

St. John Paul II has courted several controversies since being elected as Pope Benedicto XVI’s replacement in 2013. Francis has gone on record to say that homosexuals are not to be judged, Proselytism is a fallacy and has endorsed the usage of contraceptive by Catholics.

The Vatican will meet again with Muslim leaders in late October where they plan to talk about further steps that can be taken to spread understanding and awareness of the Islamic religion."

Kim has given advice to countless women both in Hollywood and in real-life, with names like Barbara Walters and Oprah Winfrey among the ranks of women that came to Kim for counseling.

Yet she has always gotten the short end of the stick when it comes to the critical response of her work as an icon for the entire mainstream American media. But one thing has never faltered: her commitment to making a difference as role model for young girls and successful women everywhere.

Kim K. is the most successful woman in America, practically a household name in countries with no knowledge even of Jesus Christ. But aside from incredible, breathtaking beauty and big heart, what are the most popular, truth-be-told reasons that people adore her? Let’s look at the facts:

1. Kim Kardashian has cultivated her image in the foremost way that all women aspire to, and she has never compromised her values.

2. Kim Kardashian sells her belongings to help some of the world’s most ungrateful charity organizations.

3. Kim Kardashian is a “music” lover, which is why she married Kanye West, a “musician”.

Admirable women in the 21st century, take note.

ADMIRABLE WOMEN IN THE 21ST CENTURY, TAKE NOTE.

4. Kim Kardashian’s artistic vision has taken her to the most prestigious magazine covers and cameo appearances in the highest grossing box office films of 2012 & 2013.

5. Kim Kardashian is endorsed by products that promote individuality and confidence in women.

6. Kim Kardashian is business savvy, unlike most women.

7. Kim Kardashian’s television program, “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” is considered by many to be the funniest tv show since The Cosby Show, making her also the funniest woman currently on television.

8. Kim Kardashian is ethnic and has overcome many struggles and fought adversity in life to achieve her success, in literally the exact same ways that Kanye West himself also did.

9. Kim Kardashian is an animal lover and only wears synthetic clothing. She would never harm a defenseless animal to wear as clothing.

10. Kim Kardashian maintains respectable male friendships, as many women are unable to do.

If people could humble themselves, they could learn a lot from Kim K.

Mother Theresa was important to the world in a very similar way, but Kim Kardashian has it figured it out, and is turning the tide for female success everywhere."

A recent National Report story explains Bieber had gotten himself in a heap of trouble after some choice comments he made towards a young Australian girl which apparently lead to her taking her own life.

Bieber was partying with friends at Perth’s Hyatt Regency in Australia when the incident occurred. The out of control pop star approached a girl named Julie Gunn while she was sunbathing by the pool. Witnesses claim Bieber began attacking and berating the girl over her figure. Another guest who was present during the shameful display issued an anonymous statement, saying;”Justin looked over at her and said ‘What are you, Hawaiian or something?’ She said, ‘No, I’m not.’ Then he said, ‘You look like a beached whale’… The girl said, ‘Are you serious’ and he said, ‘You should go on The Biggest Loser.’ Everyone laughed as the girl ran away in hysterics. It was a scene straight out of a really crappy after-school special.’”

‘What are you, Hawaiian or something?…..You look like a beached whale…..You should go on The Biggest Loser.’

Ms. Gunn was later found deceased in her flat having over-dosed on several pints of alcohol and half a bottle of prescription Valium. She left behind a suicide note in which she refers to the encounter with Bieber, saying “The day the earth cracked open and swallowed me whole, like a whale… Like a big, fat, stupid whale sucking up krill in the ocean like a retarded moron.” Evidently, her already turbulent self-esteem had plummeted to such a degree that she had begun to neglect all measures of proper personal hygiene after the Bieber incident. Her body was found on a bare mattress, wearing the same bikini she donned when Bieber unleashed his verbal vitriol on her. The room in which the mattress was found was filled with fast food waste, human feces, and empty wine cooler bottles.

RIPJULIEJulie Gunn’s roommate, Karen Willis, revealed that Bieber’s hateful commentary towards Julie had left her devastated. Almost instantly after arriving home from the party, Julie had begun drinking non-stop, and refused to leave her flat. Every time she dared to set foot outside of her home, strangers would pick up where Bieber left off, heckling her on the streets for her husky figure.

“Julie was just living a normal, average life before Justin called her a beached whale, after that everything changed”, Karan explained during an interview with the police. “Everywhere she went after that, people just couldn’t help themselves from taking a jab at the Justin Bieber whale girl. The insults were relentless.” In the end, it became too much for Julie to bear.

Each day, radio stations play the wrong tracks because there’s almost no known ways to tell which songs are Coldplay and which are Radiohead, which begs the question, “Is Coldplay even real?” Well, some could argue that in theory they aren’t.

Other artists that have used this technique are Phil Anselmo, of white supremacist nu-metal bands Pantera and Down, Maynard James Keenan, vocalist of nu-metal band A Perfect Circle and rap-rock band Tool, and Trent Reznor. While absolutely comparable to all of these bands, Coldplay / Radiohead use their own style of emotional British nu-metal to fill the music industry with the market of unaffordable British angst.

These are this month’s most discussed reasons for why Radiohead should put a sock in it already. If you ask me, you guys have some really fabulous reasons, but we’re always looking to hear more.

This is said to be in protest to a government that does not respect their religious rights, and a minority that has encroached on one of their time honored traditions.

Since the historic day in which gay couples could wed nation wide, thousands of Christian couples are filing for divorce.

Mary Lambert and her husband Jay were among the first to arrive at the courthouse in Topeka Kansas to file for divorce. Despite having been married for over 14 years, they chose to call it quits to avoid affiliation with a government that no longer respects their values. “I love my husband very much, but above all, I love my god, Jesus Christ. This is why we are moving forward in defiance of the Supreme Court ruling. If our government chooses to celebrate sin and spit on one of the most righteous ceremonies within our faith, then they are on their own. Marriage is about so much more than love. A family cannot grow together if they have no relationship with Christ. Anything else is just a sad parody. It’s unfortunate that even our president has made the choice to stoop so low and pander to Satan’s agenda

Adam Cyrus is the founder of Christ in Family Services which provides bible-based counseling to married Christian couples throughout Topeka Kansas. Cyrus says he supports the wave of high-principled duos seeking divorce as an act of protest. “We are symbolically divorcing a government which no longer honors our culture and values. We have no desire to benefit from a system which characterizes us as the enemy and enables and rewards sin under the guise of holy matrimony. If they wish to reward and empower those who desire to make a mockery of our faith, and misrepresent our religion, then we intend to remove ourselves altogether from this bureaucracy so that we may practice our faith in accordance to our beliefs.”"

The decision comes hot on the heels of the marijuana legalization measure which takes effect July 1st throughout Oregon.

Carol Shapiro is the newly appointed coordinator for the Oregon Department of Marijuana Reparations, and he elaborated on how this system will work to get those effected by previous laws, back on their feet. “These were essentially incidents that should have never have been tried as crimes to begin with. Thousands of people have payed dearly over the years for laws which have criminalized a substance that is basically less dangerous than any over-the-counter painkiller.”

“Individuals who was served prison time for drug offenses involving marijuana within the last 10 years will automatically be eligible for a refund of any fines and fees incurred as a result of those convictions, as well as compensation for pain and suffering endured from being incarcerated. These parties will also have their records automatically expunged. We are hoping that these actions will correct the injustices previously inflicted upon innocent citizens, and help them to go on with their lives.”

This news comes as a bittersweet relief to those who have faced serious consequences within the last 10 years for their involvement in marijuana growing operations. People such as Portland native Marcus Ford who spent two years in prison in 1999 after his marijuana growing operation was discovered by police. “What can I say. It’s not like I am going to get those years of my life back or get the job back that I lost at the time. I don’t think the federal government is aware of the scope of what people have had to deal with when they went to jail for things as innocuous as marijuana. I didn’t see my kids for 2 years. I spent an additional 4 years on probation. It literally made my life hell and caused my family so much stress and anguish. I am glad they are trying to make up for it, but basically no amount of money is going to replenish what I lost when I got locked up for growing. It’s a relief that they understand the error of their ways now, but keep in mind a lot of us have paid the ultimate price in this pointless war.”"

For the past two years Judy has made it her primary goal to mandate a law requiring all parents of children under the ages of 16 years old to be physically fit. Backed by several prominent law makers, she is close to seeing her dream finalized when Iowa Legislature votes on parental fitness tests mandatory for couples and individuals looking to have a child.Civic Tribune spoke with Mrs. Strauss on Monday and inquired her motivation and what she eventually hopes to achieve with this new law. She had the following to say:

“People don’t seem to understand that parenthood is a privilege, not a right. The numbers of children being born into homes where parents are inadequate is absolutely staggering. In many cases, we have unhealthy people who simply run rampant, producing several children that they are unable to care for on any level.”

“Foster care and adoption services absorb some of these costs but the overall damage inflicted by these unfortunate couplings is long-lasting and tangible. There has been several instances where adoptive parents do their best to raise a child in the correct manner, but the child’s genetic programming is too strong to ignore, regardless of efforts and investments of the adopter. It’s clearly nature over nurture in a lot of cases. These heartbreaking scenarios happens every day. We are simply trying to control the number of children born to adults who are biologically hardwired for failure, disease and addiction.”

The Bill has caused quite a stir in the Midwestern region and even gained country-wide notoriety after being parodied on Saturday Night Live. In addition to being slammed by several local politicians, the proposal is unwelcome by the majority of residents.

The program provides no-cost pregnancy termination services for those who have failed their parental adequacy tests. If a person refuses the termination, they may be forcibly arrested and detained until they comply with the protocol."

The Sappho-Luxe company has released a product dubbed “Fem-Flo” earlier this week amid media attention surrounding Caitlin Jenner’s coming out as a trans-woman. Company founder, Cheryl Goldsmith, said about the product’s timing, “It certainly was a interesting coincidence, but not intentional. The additional exposure does not hurt, and regardless of the timing, we feel as if our product will be well received amongst the trans community. We are hoping to bring each trans-woman closer to the full female experience and diminish body dysmorphia triggers altogether.”

The product comes in 3 designs. “Fem-Flo Petite” is for the trans-woman who is still working to achieve maximum dilation, yet still wants to produce menses. “Fem-Flo Intermediate” provides dilation and an average amount of menstruation. And last, but not least, the “Fem-Flo Lush” for the trans-woman who wishes to enjoy “heavy” menstruation.

“Our product is designed to give post-op trans-gender women the full-spectrum experience of menstruation. You don’t have to be deprived of the beautiful and womanly occurrence of menstruation merely because you were born without uterus. The Fem-Flo’s cotton core contains a small, vegetable-based capsule which upon reaching body temperature releases the “menses” contained within. It also aids in keeping the post-op canal conditioned and dilated after surgery and beyond.”

Fem-Flo tampons will come in boxes of 25 and cost around $19.99 per box. Sappho-Luxe will begin shipping their product to major grocery stores nationwide next month."

Attorney General Sessions seems more motivated lately, probably for reasons having something to do with the Presidential teeth marks he’s now sporting. He’s promising action, saying, “I have not been happy with the past prosecutions and investigations of criminal leaks.”

Sessions says, “We’ve already taken a number of steps, we’ll have multiple, we’ll have a press conference next week about it, but we already have multiples numbers of prosecutions compared to last year at this time. We’re stepping up those cases, it cannot continue. Some people need to go to jail. If we can make cases they are going to jail.”

Judge Napolitano noted the use of “a term of art” when AG Sessions said “criminal leaks,” explaining that a West Wing leak of non-classified information is not a criminal leak. “But if someone unmasks from raw intelligence data, the identity of a person participating in a communication, whether it’s telephone, email or text messaging, and that is done for political purposes and not for national security purposes, that is a criminal leak. And I suggest to you that’s what has troubled the President and that’s what the Attorney General was referring to.

Hemmer asks if that is the first time AG Sessions has talked like that, with Napolitano replying, “Yes, it is the first time I have heard him say ‘criminal leaks,’ because he knows that not all leaks are crimes but the types of leaks that have bedeviled Donald Trump, that have commenced the entire mess that he’s in now, including with the special prosecutor.”

Napolitano points out that it “began when Susan Rice and her colleagues, she’s already admitted to some of this, engaged in unmasking, revealing the true names of people who participated in conversations that were captured by American and British Intelligence, and some of this was of Donald Trump before he was President.

They also delve into the Imran Awan and Debbie Wasserman Schultz scandal, noting that things aren’t looking too good for the Florida Democrat. Congressman Ron DeSantis, a House Republican notes that they need to investigate how their systems may have been compromised, so this thing is likely to get much, much deeper and larger very quickly. There was full unsupervised access for a team of spies around the clock, including the Intelligence Committee members such as their fellow Muslim, Andre Carson (D-IN).

Awan, who was arrested trying to escape the US to Pakistan is out on bail, having turned over his passport. He’s wearing a GPS ankle bracelet making it easy to locate him for the application of Seth Rich, Loretta Fuddy style Democrat Party “express justice” at any time.

Napolitano asks what Wasserman Shultz knew about Awan and his activities, calling it very intriguing. What did Hillary Clinton, who was communicating with Wasserman Schultz during the campaign and who was her protector when she was fired from the DNC, have in the emails she was sharing with Wasserman Schultz that may have been forwarded to or intercepted by Awan?

There’s so much here and it must be a really dangerous situation for the Democrats, including Obama and Clinton, because the mainstream media has ignored it completely. Eventually they’ll have to provide cursory coverage, but they’re definitely trying to keep a lid on this story.

Given all of the potential vulnerabilities and involvement of major players in the criminal wrongdoing, Napolitano says, “Look for an indictment soon to see if the government can flip this fellow” for a reduced sentence. Napolitano asks, “Who else knew about this? Did any other members of Congress know about this? Gregory Meeks (D-NY) knew, he was also still paying Awan at least through May.

A member of the House Judiciary Committee has had enough of the willful blindness of the left and the complicit and cowardly enablers in the mainstream establishment and on the right have displayed when it comes to the illegal activities of nothing-special special counsel Robert Mueller. Congressman Trent Franks (R-AZ) has issued a statement demanding things change.

Rep Franks is calling on Special Counsel Robert Mueller to resign from his position, one that he never should have accepted in the first place, considering his close personal relationship with James Comey. Clearly it wasn’t dumb luck that led Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to select Comey’s buddy so there is cause to investigate that relationship as well.

Rep Franks points out that the law government the special counsel prohibits him from serving if he has a “conflict of interest,” which includes “a personal relationship with any person substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of the investigation or prosecution.” Comey is a central witness in the witch hunt and there is a long history of friendship between him and Mueller.

Franks cited a Fox News report from May which portrayed Mueller and Comey as “longtime allies.” Mueller was the FBI Director when Comey was the Deputy Attorney General in 2003. Franks said in a statement, “Bob Mueller is in clear violation of federal code and must resign to maintain the integrity of the investigation into alleged Russian ties.”

If Mueller were interested in maintaining integrity he’d never have taken the appointment in the first place. He’s going to have to be forced into possessing integrity and he’s going to ignore those concerns for as long as he is able to get away with it.

Franks said, “Those who worked under them have attested he and Jim Comey possess a close friendship, and they have delivered on-the-record statements effusing praise of one another. No one knows Mr. Mueller’s true intentions, but neither can anyone dispute that he now clearly appears to be a partisan arbiter of justice.”

He added, “Accordingly, the law is also explicitly clear: he must step down based on this conflict of interest.”

It’s clear to everyone except the crooked Democrats running the witch hunt, Rep Franks. They’re not listening, you’re going to have to grab them by the ears and get right in their face. Start with Bobble Head Adam Schiff, and hold on tight.

All of you “racist white folks” out there using Procter and Gamble products like Bounty, Crest, Cascade, Gain, Febreze, Mr. Clean, Charmin, Tide, Downy, Gillette and more need to get “your filthy hands” off of their pure creations. And if you’re holding their stock, put in a sell order right away. You’re not good enough, with your inbred hatred and bigotry, to be a part of their wholesome, diverse, victimized company.

They’ve made it clear, by stereotyping all whites as insensitive, hate-filled racists in their current advertising campaign, that they don’t want our business. The least we can do is oblige them, take our privileged money somewhere else, to a company that doesn’t choose to prejudge us based upon the color of our skin.

The video from the billion dollar company shows a surprising lack of awareness of who their customers are. Or maybe they, like Target, with their unisex perversion push and Kellogg’s or Starbucks with their unbridled liberal assaults on regular Americans, simply don’t care. The politics is more important than their business. That’s good, then we don’t have to feel sorry for the people put out of work when their business hopefully tanks as a result of our response.

The video, “The Talk,” features blacks kids as the victims of white racism and oppression, with their parents having to have “the talk” to warn them and explain to them that it’s not right but they’re going to have to deal with it. It expands to include “those racist” cops who target innocent children, a teen boy coming home from band practice and a girl driving her a car.

“It’s not fair,” says one woman to her boy, as if life is fair for anyone. Another consoles her black daughter leaving for camp, telling her, “You can do anything they can. The difference is you’ve got to work twice as hard and be twice as smart.” [and have twice as big of a chip on your shoulder] Maybe the racist pigs at Procter and Gamble don’t know that there are some of us white boys who were pretty smart and hard-working, who never got a chance to go to summer camp. Who you gonna blame for that one, P & G, other “racist” white folks?

After adjusting the girl’s mirror from the passenger’s side, the mother tells her to be careful, but it’s not about her not getting a ticket, it’s about her not coming home. With mom giving her an out of adjustment mirror she should be concerned, but the implication is that the cop who is invariably going to pull her over for being a black driver is going to try to find a reason to shoot her.

It closes with the mother of the little girl in the opening telling her she’s not “pretty for a black girl” but just beautiful. She won’t be beautiful by the time she grows up, if Procter and Gamble keeps this brainwashing hate indoctrinating idiocy up. She’ll be a raging, entitled, demanding, parasite radical, the kind Obama put into vogue during his second term if they have their way – but a radical that uses their soap.

Let her use it. I’m never putting another one of their hateful bigoted products into my shopping cart again. A listing of their products can be found here. Compare it to your shopping list, and, if you’re as fired up as I am after watching this video, remove the ones that are on it forever. Show the racists behind this attack on and smearing of white people that we’re not going to just accept being insulted and demeaned as we have in the past. They’ve gone too far this time.

They get away with attacking us through our President. They’re coming after us personally now. They’re not getting away with either of them any longer with me. I’m taking away their power. They’re going down the drain, starting with the one in my kitchen, for the last time, and it begins now.

A non-partisan ethics watchdog group filed a complaint on Monday against Rep Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) with the Office of Congressional Ethics over her involvement in the unfolding House Pakistani spy scandal. Once again a Clinton Democrat has trouble keeping America’s secrets secret and in America.

The Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT) centered their action on Wasserman Schultz’s refusal to fire the supposed IT professional, Pakistani Imran Awan, even though he was already under criminal investigation, suspected of espionage and had prohibited from accessing the House computer network.

Last week the FBI arrested Awan at Dulles Airport as he was attempting to flee to Pakistan. He had previously wired $300,000 to associates and had $12,000 in cash on his person at the time of his arrest. Awan, his two brothers and other family members are suspected of stealing computers, improperly accessing government classified information, and transferring the contents of House members’ computer files. The Awan crime family was “employed” by thirty Democrats, allegedly as IT technicians, which provided them the access needed to conduct their espionage operations.

Most other House Democrats who had employed the Awan spies terminated those arrangements once they were exposed. Two exceptions were Gregory Meeks (D-NY) and Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL).

Wasserman Schultz even went so far as to threaten the Capitol Police Chief if a laptop of hers found stashed in a wall space in a building adjacent to Schultz’s and believed to have been in the possession of Awan weren’t returned to her although now she appears to be softening her tone. Things have heated up considerably since that threat was made.

Schultz employed Awan with tax dollars months after he was banned from House computers

FACT executive director Matthew Whitaker said, “There is something quite amiss as to why Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz continued to use taxpayer funds to employ former technology staff member, Imran Awan, even months after he was barred from accessing the House’s computer systems and a number of her colleagues severed ties with Awan.”

He added, “Since Awan’s arrest last week, Wasserman Schultz has been evasive and unable to answer even basic questions about the nature of Awan’s employment with her office. This only further confirms the urgency of an investigation into her unethical and illegal actions.”

The Daily Caller has reported extensively on the scandal, which shows the family paid over $4 million dollars in recent years in addition to potentially revealing some of our most sensitive information. The Awans had access to the email accounts of House Members such as Andre Carson (D-IN), who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, and Wasserman Schultz, who was in regular contact with Hillary Clinton, the most notorious vendor of classified information to the highest bidder in DC.

They note it is near impossible to track what they did with their access, where they used it, what files were accessed, according to a former House technology worker with first-hand knowledge of the situation.

Most disturbingly they point out that several House IT workers said that members of Congress displayed inexplicable loyalty to the Awans and expressed concern that the Awans could be blackmailing congressional Democrats.

In the post-Scaramucci press briefing, Sarah Huckabee Sanders is asked by Fox News’ John Roberts, “Was it something about the chain of command or did it have anything to do with that interview that Scaramucci did last week?”

She replied, “Look, the President certainly felt that Anthony’s comments were inappropriate for a person in that position and he didn’t want to burden General Kelly also with that line of succession. As I think we’ve made clear a few times over the course of the last couple of days to several of you individually, General Kelly has the full authority to operate within the White House and all staff will report to him.”

Roberts clarifies that the line of succession she was referring to was the direct reporting by Scaramucci to the President. He notes comments by the Kushners that they “look forward to following General Kelly’s lead,” asking “When it comes to the people who have access to the President, will that conduit be narrowed down now, will everything flow through Kelly or will some things still flow around the chief of staff’s office?”

Sanders reiterated, “As I just said, the President’s given full authority to General Kelly and he’ll make those determinations.” Asked by another reporter if that includes Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon, she again replies that “General Kelly has the full authority to carry out business as he sees fit.”

Clearly those decision are being left up to Kelly, who may make some exceptions if he deems it to be appropriate, at his own discretion. President Trump has already been accomplishing quite a bit, even with the distractions of his open door policy.

Trump’s recognition of the shortcomings of such broad and random access is likely playing into this decision as well. We may well be amazed at the amount of productivity that will be coming out of a properly managed Trump White House, one where interruptions and distractions are minimized, there is a zero tolerance policy for leaks, and more of a distinction is made between family members and conducting the people’s business.

The abrasive White House communications director who promised to stop the leaks apparently did just that. Nobody knew ahead of time that he was getting fired after just ten short days on the job. Is that a job well done, leaker Priebus exposed and gone, time to move on? Apparently so, at least in the mind of General John Kelly.

It’s ironic that the man who replaced the leaker that the ousted Anthony Scaramucci had exposed and forced out, the new White House Chief of Staff, General Kelly, was the one who urged President Trump that Scaramucci get the boot.

Press Secretary Sarah Sanders issued a statement saying, “Mr. Scaramucci felt it was best to give Chief of Staff John Kelly a clean slate and the ability to build his own team.”

It is widely believed that Scaramucci sealed his own fate last week in a profanity-laden interview with Ryan Lizza which ran in the New Yorker in which he was critical of Priebus and Steve Bannon in a vulgarly unflattering manner. It’s a dangerous proposition to join an organization and immediately begin rocking the boat, using foul language doesn’t help. To give the media sharks as much red meat as he did, in an administration that is already being ravaged on a daily basis was, barring any separate understanding or instructions from President Trump, an ill-advised tactic.

Scaramucci has had a rough week, having also gotten word that his wife, 38-year-old Deidre Ball Scaramucci, filed for divorce in the ninth month of her pregnancy to their son, who she gave birth to on Monday. At the time Scaramucci was in West Virginia with President Trump. That probably wasn’t the best decision either.

It seems that the good folks at Judicial Watch have some concerns or questions regarding the possibility that some of that infamous Clinton pay for play spilled over into potential bribery of the current acting FBI Director, who was at the time the Deputy Director, Andrew McCabe.

Judicial Watch announced, on July 28th, the filing of three FOIA lawsuits against the US Department of Justice, requesting documents related to McCabe’s political activities, travel vouchers, and employment status. The first two involve his activities related to his wife’s unsuccessful campaign for a Virginia state office and his interactions with Virginia Governor, and Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe. Judicial Watch states:

The first FOIA lawsuit, filed on July 24 (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:17-cv-01494)), seeks the following:

Any and all records of communication between FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and other FBI or Department of Justice (“DOJ”) officials regarding, concerning or relating to ethical issues concerning the involvement of Andrew McCabe and/or his wife, Dr. Jill McCabe, in political campaigns;

Any and all records related to ethical guidance concerning political activities provided to Deputy Director McCabe by FBI and/or DOJ officials or elements.

The second Judicial Watch FOIA lawsuit, filed on July 26, seeks communication records between then-Deputy Director McCabe and Gov. Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic National Committee (DNC), and the Democratic Party of Virginia (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:17-cv-01495)), including:

Any and all records of communication between Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe and any of the following individuals:

Any official within the office of the Governor of Virginia, including but not limited to Governor Terry McAuliffe;

Any official, representative or employee with the Democratic National Committee;

Any official, representative or employee with the Democratic Party of Virginia.

They note that in 2015, a political action committee run by McAuliffe, a close personal friend and political supporter and ally of Bill and Hillary Clinton, donated nearly $500,000 to Jill McCabe, Andrew McCabe’s wife, who was then running for the Virginia State Senate. Also, the Virginia Democratic Party, over which McAuliffe had significant influence, donated an additional $207,788 to the Jill McCabe campaign. In July 2015, Andrew McCabe was in charge of the FBI’s Washington, DC, field office, which provided personnel resources to the Clinton email probe.

The Hatch Act prohibits FBI employees from engaging “in political activity in concert with a political party, a candidate for partisan political office, or a partisan political group.”

The conflict of interest is obvious to all who don’t stand to gain from its exploitation, such as political candidates for President guilty of committing espionage and other criminal acts against the United States.

Information on the third, travel FOIA is available from Judicial Watch here.

Empty skull Nancy Pelosi was a guest on Fox News Sunday in which she proudly displayed the Democrat’s latest regurgitation of an old plan for winning the hearts and minds of Americans or at least of generic voters in American elections of unknown origin, and lie their way back into power.

Labeled “A Better Deal,” the plan calls for a lot of things they are actually working against, most obviously, the first bullet item, “raise wages and incomes.” Since they are the chief proponents and agitators in pursuit of lower wages and incomes, largely through the importation of cheap foreign labor, facilitated by high legal immigration rates, virtually no interior enforcement and bare bones border enforcement, it’s difficult to see their agenda accomplishing a wage increase.

We had eight years to learn the lessons of what it means to have Democrats in power and only six months thus far to forget. We haven’t forgotten. She then lists three spending items with no indication of where the money will come from to pay for them, what sort of communist wealth redistribution scheme they might attempt to implement. The money has to be transferred from the pockets of the people to the coffers of the government somehow or their make believe utopia can’t happen.

Those other three expense items are Lower Prescription Drug costs – mandated and subsidized, Increase Workforce Training – for jobs that are taken by foreigners, paid for through taxation, and Grow Infrastructure, again paid for through taxation or money borrowed from China.They all add to the national debt as well and are inflationary. There’s no income increase in a bigger pile of inflated dollars.

Wallace says, “Leader Pelosi, I’m not saying any of that is wrong [although all of it is], what I am saying is none of it is new. We’ve been hearing it for years, we heard it from the Democrats and Hillary Clinton in 2016, and you lost.”

Pelosi replies, “No, well, un, ya, weh, snort,” or something along those lines, followed by a pledge that we’re going to “hear it with more clarity.” Clarity wasn’t the issue or our hearing, Pelosi. It was your agenda and the low caliber commie criminals that represents your party; individuals such as yourself.

She says that for the first time since 2006 the Congressional Democrats are in charge of the message. Is that because they don’t have any other party leadership now that Clinton is being kicked to the curb? Their number two guy is a communist “independent whose wife is under federal investigation. “Could that familiar theme represent a problem for them?

Pelosi says that now is their turn to win the Congress for the American people. Of course the Americans are their enemy, but the truth has no relevance with these lying commie Democrats. She then adopts the position one would expect of a woman who has overseen the consistent erosion of support for her party and the loss of their elected presence across all levels of public offices nationwide, saying, “But elections are more than about winning the election.”

According to her “They’re about having a discussion about how we go for…” Wallace cuts her off in mid-idiocy with a rebuttal, saying, “Well they’re all about winning the election.” She then goes on to proclaim it’s about winning on the issues, whatever that means, which it’s hard to believe you can do without winning the vote.

It sounds like Pelosi senses they’re not through losing yet. Hopefully she’s right.

Russian President Vladimir Putin doesn’t have to deal with an ongoing coup attempt in his own country, but he and Russia are being impacted by the one Democrats, RINOs and the establishment bureaucracy are engaging in in the United States.

In their unending efforts to utilize Russia as a cudgel to illegally force President Trump from office, the Democrats and establishment Republicans in Congress have bullied even the most fair-minded of their colleagues into accepting the premise that Russia is actively engaged in hostile activities against America and deserves to be grouped in with North Korea and Iran and sanctioned.

It’s naked political gamesmanship but none of the testosterone-challenged members of Congress want to be labeled by their political opponents as weak on Russia. “Hero” John McCain and his domestic partner Lindsey say Putin’s actually the devil, and we can’t disappoint McCain, not with all he’s dealing with these days. Better to just give the RINOs what they want, they’ll deal with the consequences later. If McCain wants to bomb Moscow as well, maybe we should consider it. We’re governed by such gutless sleaze bags.

Putin presented his side of the story on Russian television in interview form, telling the reporter that he would be matching the Obama dictated diplomatic levels set on December 29th, an escalation both he and President Trump had hoped to avoid. He notes that the number of Americans working in Russia will drop from over 1,000 to 455, the same number as Russia has working in the United States after one of Obama’s final destructive acts against the US while in office.

Putin says, “755 of them will have to stop their activities, and that’s painful. America has taken a step to jeopardize US – Russia relations and the important thing is that that step wasn’t triggered by anything. This is a move to impose illegal restrictions to attempt to influence other countries, including US allies, which are interested in developing ties with Russia.”

“We’ve been waiting for quite a long time,” says Putin, “so that maybe something would change for the better. We had hoped that the situation would change but it looks like even if it does change, that it won’t be in the near future. I decided that it is time for us to show that we will not leave anything unanswered.”

Putin adds, “Of course we have more to say. There are spheres that we could restrict which would be painful for the United States. But I think we shouldn’t do that. It’s only going to harm US – Russia relations as they are, but it’s also going to affect us as well.

The anti-Trump forces don’t care what they do to harm this nation or any other. Their political ambitions are blind and they are blinded by hatred as well, and their fear of a return of power to the American people.

As Rep Steve King correctly pointed out last week and everybody who reads history knows, the US has long been intruding in the domestic affairs, including elections, of other nations all across the globe. Obama tried to defeat Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu in 2015, illegally using $350,000 in US tax dollars to do it. How sanctimonious for them to select this instance to develop a selective conscience and to exercise it upon unsubstantiated claims. That’s congressional leadership? This action by Congress does not serve our country well, it only serves the agenda of our domestic enemies.

Chris Wallace wraps up his Sunday Interview with Nancy Pelosi with what should be an easy question for her to answer, one that returns a surprise response.

As Pelosi sits there, mouth-open, like a snapping turtle eyeing a meandering bream, Wallace says, “I’ve got thirty seconds and the question is: What are the chances Democrats win back the House in 2018 and if so, will you run for Speaker?

She replies, “That is so unimportant. What is important is that we have a lively debate on a better deal.” We get the picture, she’s not there to predict her own victory, it’s about rolling out their Party’s new slogan. The last one, “You will obey, comrade,” wasn’t received very well, particularly by a percentage of their membership who still exercised free will, voting for Donald Trump. If only they could have gotten them the re-education they needed in time.

The better deal they offer, is socialized everything. Any shot at a real, wealth and productivity based economy was made nearly impossible to achieve over their mismanagement of the last eight years. They want a chance to finish us off, with Pelosi the dimwits in America “better pay, better jobs, and a better future and that’s what we look forward to having.” If that were truly what they wanted they’d be cooperating with President Trump instead of expending every bit of energy trying to force him out of office.

The despicable lying Democrat continues, saying, “We have unity in our party. You saw it with the fight on the Affordable Care Act [They no longer call their failure Obamacare] in the House and in the Senate. We’re very proud of the fact that our party has diverse thinking in it. We can accommodate that.”

Standing in lockstep opposition to the ideas and attempts to fix the mess the Democrats created is not diverse thinking. It’s a stubborn group-think adherence to Democrat dogma.

What she said makes absolutely no sense but she did manage to run the clock out as she claimed in her native doublespeak, that Democrats don’t care whether they control the House of Representatives, what’s important is unity of party over good of the country and Americans, even if it is in defeat.

Keep talking, Pelosi; you’re the best hope for Republicans’ future political fortunes this side of President Trump.

There may be no nice way to say it. While many people just tune out Feinstein when she starts running her mouth, if you are among those that pay attention to the words, it impossible to keep a puzzled expression from coming over your face and the a grunted “huh?” from passing your lips. This woman is a moron.

She begins by informing us that North Korea is a “clear and present danger to the United States” and she’s convinced that North Korea has never moved at the speed that this leader has to develop an ICBM.

Her reading left her without the expertise to finish her thoughts, describing how the North Koreans can now “put” solid fuel, “have an interesting” launch device and are able “to have” a trajectory, to hit Chicago.” The Obama – Alinsky Museum is still under construction. Can’t they wait?

She says “It points out the danger in isolating a country, that they go to the science and the technical knowhow to show their brute force not to handle the isolation.” What? Is there a coherent thought bouncing around inside that skull of hers anywhere? The blame America first Democrat is pinning the North Korean aggression on us and our policy that started under Bill Clinton.

She’s “very disappointed in China’s response in that it has not been firmer or more helpful. She hopes General Kelly will usurp Rex Tillerson’s position, “beyond the Chief of Staff,” effectively assume the role of Secretary of State as well and “begin some very serious negotiation with ‘the North.'”

On Obamacare repeal efforts in the Senate, the glass house resident picks up a big handful of health care rocks, saying, “You can’t take a bill as big as this one, write it with a select group of people in a back room, not let one of the political parties even see it until the Friday before a vote comes up and think that this bill is going to pass.”

Of course that’s exactly what the Democrats did to shove Obamacare through, the pass it to find out what’s in it logic. Maybe her memory is starting to fail her, including the part where we had a perfectly good, functioning and less expensive healthcare system in place before these big government Democrats started trying to “fix” things in 2009.

Dickerson challenges her on the Democrat demands for an individual mandate as a pretext for negotiations which forces her to immediately change the subject to the insurance companies, and people who “want to participate in the exchanges who are without carriers. And you’ve got several million who don’t have a choice of insurance carriers.”

Gee Feinstein, how did that happen? What destroyed the best healthcare system on the planet? The answer is “Democrats and Obamacare,” in case you felt the urge to change the subject again, that’s what happened. She calls for a new approach that no Republican has every thought of trying, saying, “I think we need to take a look at this, what is wrong?” Proactive geniuses like her don’t come along every day.

Feinstein says maybe it’s the states that are to blame, just too damn many of them – one federal system sounds good to her. She also says you’ve got real problems with the subsidies [wealth redistribution to prop up a doomed system] losing Dickerson on her excursion into the weeds of the mess Democrats created all by themselves. He changes the topic, time is running short and she needs to get another shot in at President Trump.

He asks her about AG Sessions, with Feinstein defending him, saying enough pressure has been put on President Trump to force him not to fire him, “unless of course, what he really intends is to end up firing [Democrat dirty cop hit man] Mueller, which could well be the beginning of the end of his Presidency.”

Nice threat, Feinstein. If he fires the guy that you scumbags have manipulated into place to take him down it’s the end of him. Kind of a no win situation, wouldn’t you say? Why not fire the crooked Soros henchman of yours now and at least give himself a chance to come out a winner? He could investigate all of you crooked Democrats to boot.

Rep Jim Jordan encouraged his colleagues to vote in the affirmative on an amendment calling for the Justice Department to appoint a second Special Counsel to investigate the criminal syndicate that was the Obama regime, a vote which was passed out of committee along party lines.

He starts off by noting the effort of Loretta Lynch to provide cover for Hillary Clinton by instructing FBI Director Comey to call the investigation a “matter.” He asks, “Why would the Attorney General meet with the subject of the investigation’s husband three days before the subject of the investigation is to be interviewed by the FBI?”

He asks, “Why would that happen? Maybe because they wanted Clinton to win the election.” He asks why there isn’t an investigation into the Obama administration’s influence on our election to go along with the manufactured ones about Russia.

Jordan says, “Think about this, you had the Attorney General of the United States tell the FBI Director of the United States, ‘Go tell the American public something that is not true.’ And he did it. He did it willfully, he did it intentionally, he did it at the direction of the United States Attorney General.”

He reminds his colleagues that they are the Judiciary Committee, “charged with defending the Constitution, and we have a Justice Department that knowingly, intentionally, willfully misled the American public in the middle of a campaign? And we’re not going to ask for these documents and we’re not going to pass a resolution saying we need a special counsel? Are you kidding me?”

He tells more of the Comey corruption story that we are all familiar with, how he engineered and manipulated, with assistance from their buddy Rod Rosenstein, the appointment of his buddy Mueller to be the Russia, Russia, Russia special counsel.

Jordan addresses the existence of the two separate systems of justice, the one for the regular folks and another those named Comey, Lynch or Clinton. He says, “This is the Judiciary Committee, this is important stuff, this is fundamental stuff. This is exactly the kind of thing that we should be focused on, exactly the kind of resolution we should pass, exactly the kind of resolution calling for a special counsel that should pass this committee, with the letter and be supported by the full House of Representatives.”

U.K. Police Vow to Come After Anyone Who Posts ‘Offensive’ Material on Twitter

George Orwell, call your office.

By M.J. Randolph, Truth Revolt, July 31, 2017 (thanks to Lookmann):

The Wiltshire Police in the United Kingdom have had it with incivility on social media platforms. (Honestly, who hasn’t?) Last week, they posted a threat against people who are writing offensive tweets. Yes, really:

People were immediately taken aback — do Brits really want their cops to be deciding what is and what is not offensive on Twitter? Is it rational to hand that sort of power over to the government? After the outcry, however, the police force doubled down:

Sheesh. The answer to bad speech is not to silence the bad speech. An article over at The American Prospect explains this very well:

We are dealing here with bad ideas, not physical blows or the absence of ideas. For that problem John Stuart Mill had the right answer long ago in his famous essay “On Liberty.” He said that we must allow for the expression of bad ideas — whether opinions or alleged statements of fact — because they may contain some grain of truth that corrects the conventional wisdom or, lacking that, provide a challenge to accepted beliefs, without which those beliefs in the long run become mere prejudices. As Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis advised, in his famous Whitney v. California opinion in 1927, “If there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.”

Yes, it would be really nice to have a hate-speech free internet, but it would come at a very high cost: freedom."

Ringleader of child sex gang to be released from prison 17 years early

By Ashitha Nagesh for Metro, 30 Jul 2017 10:33 am

The notorious leader of a sex gang has been released from prison 17 years early.

Mubarek Ali, who was one of two ringleaders of the gang in Telford, is just five years into his 22-year prison sentence for his horrific crimes.

The sexual grooming gang had preyed on girls as young as 13 for at least two years, who had confided in youth workers about the abuse.

Ali, 34, was then captured as part of a police investigation called Operation Chalice in 2013, and was jailed for 22 years.

However, he is now reportedly set to be released on licence as early as November.

Telford MP Lucy Allen said that Ali’s release was ‘wrong’, and could lead to him rejoining the community where his victims continue to live.

Allen spoke of the issue in the Commons last week, demanding that victims of child sexual exploitation are treated better.

In an open letter to local paper the Shropshire Star, she added that his victims are ‘living in fear’ and should have been properly consulted before his release.

‘Victims and members of the public would have expected a 22-year sentence to mean that the community could have time to heal and victims would be able to get on with their lives,’ she said.

‘What we see in this case is that one of the main perpetrators is being released into the community only five years after the trial.

‘This is clearly of enormous concern to victims in this case, especially those who gave evidence in court.’

Four young women, who were aged 13 to 16 when they were abused between 2007 and 2009, gave evidence to Worcester Crown Court during the trial in 2013.

Mubarek’s co-defendant, 27-year-old Ahdel Ali, was sentenced to 26 years in prison.

In an affidavit filed in another case, the government disclosed that the FBI undercover agent had actually ‘traveled to Garland, Texas, and was present … at the event.’”

“The undercover FBI agent,” “60 Minutes” said, “was in a car directly behind Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi when they started shooting. This cell-phone photo of school security guard Bruce Joiner and police officer Greg Stevens was taken by the undercover agent seconds before the attack.” Here are copies of some of his cell phone footage.

Cooper speculated, “If this attack had gone a different way, and lots of people had been killed, would the fact that an undercover FBI agent was on the scene have become essentially a scandal?” The FBI agent at the scene of the crime reflected the Obama administration’s overall attitude.

“The Obama administration steadfastly pursued unreality and fantasy with regard to Islam,” she said.

Garland Police keeping tight grip on documents two years after ISIS attack

August 1, 2017: by Todd Shepherd | Washington Examiner,

Police in Garland, Texas, are refusing to release documents that could show an FBI agent allowed a terrorist attack to go ahead in 2015, in order to avoid blowing his cover.

Police are still saying key documents can’t be shared because the investigation is still “pending,” even though the police chief said just days after the attack that they did not believe there were other suspects, and the two known assailants were killed on the scene. The 2015 attack was the first ISIS-backed act of terrorism on U.S. soil.The tight hold on documents by police is making it difficult for a security guard who was shot during the event to learn whether an undercover FBI agent was there at the scene and knew that a terrorism event was being planned. The security guard’s lawyer believes the FBI agent was trying to get close to the terrorists and may not have warned authorities of the event in order to keep his cover.

In May of 2015, political activist Pamela Geller was hosting a “Draw Muhammad” contest at the Curtis Culwell center in Garland, a northeast suburb of Dallas. Two radicalized Islamists, Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi, drove from Phoenix to Garland in a car loaded with numerous firearms and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.

The two men were stopped at a parking checkpoint at the perimeter of the parking lot at the center and opened fire. The security guard, Bruce Joiner, was shot in the knee, and because the event was heavily guarded, Simpson and Soofi only made it a few yards past the checkpoint before they were fatally shot.

Joiner and his attorney now want to learn everything they can about a 60 Minutes report that said an undercover FBI was right behind Simpson and Soofi’s car and was taking pictures of the men just before they opened fire.

Court documents reveal that the undercover agent had been in contact with Simpson, and had even texted him weeks earlier, “Tear up Texas.”

As the attack began, the undercover FBI agent fled the scene, but was briefly detained by the Garland Police. Part of that episode was caught on camera by the Dallas news station WFAA.

ISIS later claimed credit for the attack, making it the first ever ISIS-sponsored attack on U.S. soil, and at a May 11, 2015 news conference, Garland Police Chief Mitch Bates said, “At this time, we have no evidence that there were any other suspects involved in this attack.”

(Credit: WFAA-TV)

The Washington Examiner has requested all documentation from the Garland Police Department that mentioned or made reference to the FBI agent and is currently working through administrative legal issues in hopes of obtaining the documentation, but the “pending” label could be an insurmountable hurdle.

The “case status” box on the investigation report forms on Simpson and Soofi that Garland provided are marked “CLOSED/CLEARED.” The same case status is provided on the investigation report into Joiner, the security guard injured at the scene. In a filing with the Texas attorney general, the city attorney’s office also stated about the Examiner’s request:

“The Chief of Police of the Garland Police Department considers this case to be a pending investigation. The fact that the statue of limitations has not run in this matter is enough, in and of itself, to justify the Chief’s determination, as additional information regarding an incident often becomes known long after the original incident and forms the basis for additional law enforcement action.”

Representatives from the Garland Police Department and the Garland City Attorney’s office have not responded to multiple requests for comment.

Open-government advocates like Shannon Kelley with the Texas Freedom of Information Foundation are all too familiar with the issue of police departments using the “pending” label.

“Unfortunately, some law enforcement agencies use a loophole in the Texas Public Information Act to withhold police records even though a suspect is deceased. The law allows investigative records to be withheld if a case didn’t end in a conviction or deferred adjudication, but that exemption is intended for living suspects,” Kelley told the Examiner.

“When a suspect is dead, the public should have the ability to see the records and learn what happened,” Kelley concluded.

In the legislative session this past spring for the Texas General Assembly, a state representative introduced a bill that would have compelled law enforcement agencies to provide case documentation in instances where the suspect died. However, the bill failed later in the session.

Joiner is now the one leading the push to discover what the FBI knew about the impending attack in the days and months before. Joiner’s attorney, Trenton Roberts of Houston, previously told the Washington Examiner he thinks the evidence supports a theory that the FBI knew the attack was imminent, but did little to stop it.

“It seems like it had to have been one or the other,” Roberts told the Washington Examiner in April. “Just a complete botched operation where they [the FBI] don’t want the attack to actually take place, or, it’s something where they need the attack to take place in order for this guy [the agent] to advance in the world of ISIS.”

“And that’s really what I think. I think that they thought, ‘He’s undercover and in order to advance, he needed to get pictures or video of this attack,’ and then that would bolster his street cred within ISIS,” Roberts said.

Joiner is considering suing the FBI and, due to legal constraints, would have to file his lawsuit by the end of October if he chose to go forward with litigation."

Out: Obama’s Jihad Policy Chief at DHS,"['Geller Report Staff', 'Mark Steiner', 'David Square', 'Tony Holmquist', 'Soundclick.Com Globalfirm']","John Kelly, just hours before accepting the role of chief of staff in President Donald Trump’s White House, announced the resignation of a key Department of Homeland Security holdover from Barack Obama days — a man named George Selim.

What’s significant about Selim is that he served for three different administrations — he was a lifer, an entrenched bureaucrat, with solid and substantial connections. So the fact that he’s finally been removed is significant in itself.

But it’s Selim’s role within DHS that is most note-worthy. Selim served as the head of the now-defunct Countering Violent Extremism unit, a program that provided federal support for Islamic groups that promised to turn Muslim migrants and refugees away from lives of terror and jihad.

This was an Obama dream-come-true. And Kelly killed it when he took over DHS — but Selim still stayed.

The main problem with the program, of course, is that it didn’t really work.

It proved a drain on taxpayer dollars. But more importantly, it proved a government stamped shelter for radical Islamic groups that simply wanted to use their platform to demand more and more concessions from the government.

Bluntly put: CVE was a pure example of cultural jihad in America. And Selim served basically as Obama’s jihad policy chief.

Well, now he’s gone. And thank goodness.

America is under siege. And those of us who have sounded the alarm about this for so many years are demonized, smeared and marginalized.

“Topeka native John Booker Jr. gets 30 years for Fort Riley bomb plot,” by Steve Fry, Topeka Capital-Journal, July 24, 2017:

KANSAS CITY, Kan. — John T. Booker Jr., a Topeka man convicted in a plot to detonate an explosive device at Fort Riley, was sentenced Monday to a life term of 30 years in a federal prison.

Booker, 22, pleaded guilty on February 3, 2016, to attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction and attempting to destroy government property by fire or explosion. In exchange for the guilty pleas, a third charge of providing material support to the Islamic State was dismissed.

Booker was sentenced to 30 years for attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction and to 20 years for attempting to destroy government property. The sentences will run concurrently.

After completing the sentences, Booker will be under lifetime supervised release on the conviction of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction and a concurrent supervision of three years on the attempting to destroy government property, U.S. District Court Judge Carlos Murguia said….

During a rambling statement he made to Murguia, Booker complained that he wasn’t given help to deal with his mental health issues.

If he had received money to help him deal with his problems, Booker wouldn’t be in court facing two sentences Monday, Booker told the judge.

However, after Booker’s sentencing, FBI officials disagreed with Booker, saying FBI agents, who initially identified themselves to Booker as federal agents, had sought to aid Booker with his mental health problems, sometimes driving him to appointments if he needed transportation.

“We wanted to get him the mental health help he thought he needed,” said Aaron Tapp, supervisory special agent in charge in Topeka.

To help Booker, the FBI also contacted a local Topeka mosque, contacted Imam Omar Hazim at the mosque to talk to Booker, and attempted to get people in the mosque to aid Booker, Tapp said.

The FBI met with Booker’s family, who said they had done everything they could to help him, Tapp said.

Agents monitored Booker to see whether he had changed, Tapp said.

But when Booker’s behavior and his radical Islamic beliefs continued, Darrin E. Jones said, then the FBI conducted an undercover operation and arrested him after he agreed to detonate what he thought was an explosive device at Fort Riley.

Jones is the special agent in-charge of the Kansas City field office of the FBI. The device was inert, meaning it wouldn’t explode….

The FBI’s first contact with Booker was in March 2014 when someone complained to the FBI that Booker had posted on Facebook that intended “to commit jihad and that he was not scared to die,” the factual basis for his guilty plea said…."

The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children reported its members now provide three times the amount of counseling for these young girls as they did just five years ago.

If a child or young person you know is worried about forced marriage, remind them that #Childline is always here on 0800 1111 or online. pic.twitter.com/NDfF6B94Jn

And the victims are as young as 13.

Breitbart has more:

Some of the victims are as young as 13 and they are frequently threatened with violence and emotional blackmail, pressuring them to marry older men they may have never met.

Childline, the 24-hour counselling hotline for children provided by the NSPCC, has experienced more children than ever are calling with fears over forced marriage. The charity said it delivered 12 per cent more counselling sessions in 2016/17 than in 2015/16.

Forced marriage can carry a prison sentence of up to seven years in the UK, but as of December 31, 2016, figures suggest there has been just one conviction in Britain.

The charity said some families use the long school summer holidays to pull children out of Britain and marry them off abroad to strangers.

The full scale of the abuse may be unknown, however, as some girls do not speak out because they are “worried about family honour and being isolated by their communities” and fear their “relatives would be punished if they sought help.”

One 18-year-old girl who contacted Childline said: “My parents are talking about taking me back to my home country to get married, but I don’t want to. They get violent when I don’t do what they want.

“I want to leave home but they’d never agree to it. I just want to live a normal teenage life, but they won’t let me.”

NSPCC Chief Executive Peter Wanless commented: “Forcing a child to marry shows a complete lack of regard for their feelings, thoughts or ambitions. We must be clear that, regardless of cultural expectations, this is a crime and an abuse of human rights.”

Childline founder and president Dame Esther Rantzen added: “Young people can feel helpless because sometimes those near to them aren’t interested in their happiness or welfare.

“It’s desperately important that those are frightened or feel that they have no one to turn to get in touch with Childline.”

There has been a similar failure to prosecute perpetrators of female genital mutilation (FGM) – another crime largely associated with migrant communities.

Despite the practice being illegal in the UK for 31 years, and more than 5,000 new cases recorded in England last year, not a single successful prosecution has been made."

This is the Germany she has made. She will be remembered as the Chancellor who destroyed Germany — after Hitler did it before her in 1945. But this time, a German recovery is doubtful in the extreme.

“Go to a hospital and calmly slay them!,” Bild, July 27, 2017:

How does ISIS recruit its attackers in Germany? What are the last instructions before the terrorists strike and kill as many innocent people as possible?

For months, BILD reporter Björn Stritzel pretended to be an Islamist willing to carry out an attack (always in consultation with the security authorities).

In a new series, BILD documents the chats with the ISIS terrorists.

My ISIS instructor recommends a video to me. It is a straightforward instruction on how to kill. At the beginning of the video, past ISIS attacks in the West are celebrated – the axe-attacker from Würzburg is also briefly shown. This is followed by the headline: “Explanation of how to slay the disbelievers”.

A ruined house can be seen, in which a prisoner is chained to a concrete pillar with handcuffs. A masked jihadist explains in French why terror attacks against the “crusaders” must be carried out.

Then the terrorist – who is introduced as Abu Sulayman al-Faransi – shows several knives (from a kitchen knife to a combat knife) and explains which ones are suitable for an attack. “Jack-knives are bad because of the unstable blade”….

My German-language ISIS instructor wants me to use the knife techniques shown in the video – in Germany. He immediately suggests several suitable targets: “Go to an old people’s home, that’s very easy.” I ask whether that is permitted, even by ISIS’s radical interpretation of Islam. “Is an old people’s home allowed from an Islamic perspective?” His answer is clear: “Yes, inshallah. Or to go a monastery or a church.”

He is obviously suggesting targets where potential victims will show little resistance, or that have a special symbolic value. An attack of this kind already happened: on July 26, 2016, two ISIS terrorists cut the priest Jacques Hamel’s throat in a church in Normandy. Amaq later published a letter claiming responsibility first, and then a martyr’s video of the terrorists, who were shot by the police.

My instructor knows about the shock that this murder caused worldwide. This is exactly what he wants to repeat. “Believe me, Akhi, it will fill their hearts with so much terror, because everybody can do this.”…

In order to remove any last doubts I might have, he promises me heavenly rewards for the murder: “It will also encourage many Muslims to do the same, and then you will receive your reward.”

What he means is the reward in the afterlife. In this Salafist-jihadist ideology, when a jihadist’s deeds inspire others, this counts extra towards heavenly rewards. Not only is one’s own terror attack added to one’s “martyr account”, but also the attacks of those who were inspired by it….

I explain to my ISIS instructor that, despite the knife techniques in the video, I am too clumsy to kill a person. He also has a solution for this problem: “Akhi, trust in Allah, wallahi it is very easy. Simply walk into a hospital … Take flowers with you and go to the inpatient ward, where the severely ill are. Then calmly slay them. Very calmly.”

Hiding a knife in a bouquet of flowers in order to murder severely ill people – so this is what jihad is for my ISIS instructor.

“Sheikh al-Adnani rahimahuallah has said this many times. We want very simple operations, because the enemy cannot stop these. Do you understand, akhi?”

Al-Adnani – whom my ISIS instructor refers to here – was one of the highest-ranking ISIS leaders…."

“Mubarek Ali, leader of child sex gang that abused girls in Telford, to be freed 17 years early,” by Ludovica Iaccino, International Business Times, July 30, 2017:

The convicted leader of a child sex gang that operated in England will be released from prison 17 years earlier, according to reports.

Mubarek Ali, one of a number of member who helmed of the Telford-based gang, was sentenced to 22 years in jail for crimes including assaulting girls as young as 13.

However, just five years into his sentence, he has been told he could walk free as early as November.

Ali, 34, was captured as part of a police investigation called Operation Chalice in 2013. During the trial at the Worcester Crown Court, four girls aged between 13 and 16 gave evidence of the abuse they had been subjected to by the gang member between 2007 and 2009.

At the time, Deborah Gould, prosecuting, warned the jury that as the trial unfolded they would be introduced to a world “that I expect few of you were aware of”.

It is believed most of the girls involved thought they were “loved and in love” with the men at the time, the prosecution explained.

Telford MP Lucy Allan criticised the decision to free him, arguing he would be allowed to go back into the community where his victims continue to live.

In an open letter sent to the paper, Allan said the victims, who had not been informed of Ali’s early release, are “living in fear”.

“Victims and members of the public would have expected a 22-year sentence to mean that the community could have time to heal and victims would be able to get on with their lives,” she said.

“What we see in this case is that the one of the main perpetrators is being released into the community only five years after the trial. This is clearly of enormous concern to victims in this case, especially those who gave evidence in court.

“What is unacceptable that in this case there was no attempt by the authorities to reach out these young women and prepare them for this wholly unexpected event,” Allan continued…."

Yes, because they aren’t suicidal.

How the Migrant Crisis is Pushing Italy Away from Europe

Eurocrisis in the Press

by Alessandro Franzi, London School of Economics, July 2017 (thanks to Lookmann):

Immigration is going to be the political battleground of the next Italian general elections due in 2018. Virtually all major political leaders have hardened their position on borders protection following the new migration crisis in the Mediterranean. Austerity policies and lack of democracy in the EU integration process were the main concerns during the European elections campaign three years ago. Identity issue is now deepening Italian disaffection with Europe by boosting a patriotic rhetoric promoted by both right-wing and left-wing parties.

The fear of an uncontrolled influx of people has strengthened in the last two years while the sea crossing from Libya to South of Italy has become the main access route for migrants and refugees to Europe. According to the minister of Interior, the number of people arrived on Italian shores has increased almost 7 per cent since the beginning of the year. The current 94.000 asylum seekers [1] are expected to grow to 200.000 by the end of the summer.

Italy is just a transit country for most of them who try to reach their networks to the North. The Italian government has repeatedly invoked European solidarity to cope with reception problems. However, Italian citizens feel their concerns over immigration are ignored by EU institutions in favor of national interests [2]. The main consequence could be the rise of the first Eurosceptic government among the founder countries.

The Left Dilemma

“We cannot welcome them all”, leftwing leader Matteo Renzi said after his Democratic Party had lost June 2017 local elections to the center-right opponents. The party has been running the government since 2013 and it’s under pressure because of the rising number of asylum seekers and the denial of other EU countries like France to open their ports to refugee rescue boats. Additionally more and more local mayors refuse to welcome new migrants [3] in a bid to avoid unpopularity amongst their communities.

A recent SWG survey [4] indicates that the majority of Italians (54 per cent) is in favor of a total ban on new arrivals. This percentage has increased by six points since January. Furthermore back in 2003 65 percent of the Italian public considered migrants a resource but the percentage has now dropped to 35 percent. Researches underline that “approval for hard and simplistic solutions are finding fertile and expansive soil in the middle-low classes, in the middle class affected by the crisis and inflamed in its social identity”. They add that “the immigration issue has been underestimated by European governments and has been faced with an emergency approach”.

The Democratic Party seems to be paying the higher political price for this emergency approach that has exasperated Italian public opinion. When Mr. Renzi served as Italian prime minister up to last December, he used to say only “beasts” want to block immigrants who risk their life crossing the Mediterranean. He changed tone after June council elections by arguing that “too much” of them have been going on national shores these years. The former PM invited left-wing establishment to give traditional identity a good value and suggested to “help migrants in their own countries”. The latter is the same slogan of both far right candidate Matteo Salvini and populist Five Stars Movement.

It’s not just a lexical revolution, because current left-wing government is trying to pursue a ‘law and order’ political action. Italy urges Europe to share the responsibility of migrant crisis and is trying to impose on NGOs operating in the Mediterranean Sea new rules of conduct in order to limit their rescue activities [5]. Rome wants also to speed up the repatriation process for those migrants who are not qualified for international protections. This effort could unfortunately be out of time.



The Populist Option

Immigration is not a new problem for Mediterranean countries but it has become significantly worse following the ouster of Muammar Gaddafi from Libya in 2011. In the past six years Italian politics has been ideologically divided into two factions. The one on the left side supporting extreme hospitality as a duty, the other on the right side accused of xenophobia [6]. Meanwhile no government party has proposed a comprehensive reform of immigration laws. The result is a growing popular concern boosted by a growing sensational approach by mainstream media.

Just six months before the next general elections, the Italian political landscape is now dominated by the current immigration issue. The Left is considering to be chasing its political enemies in order to stop the loss of consents. However this could definitely decrease its chance of victory. Traditional left-wing parties are not yet able to “offer protection” to the weakest member of society because they are associated with the élite in charge, as claimed by sociologist Luca Ricolfi [7]. Mr. Ricolfi, who has a progressive background, suggests this protection nowadays comes easier from populist options.

Underestimating the immigration consequences has strengthened all opposition forces in Italy and weakened citizens’ confidence in the EU. Virtually all politicians publicly blame the European institutions for allowing what they call the “invasion” of Italy. They had done the same in order to justify the high rates of unemployment. Moreover, the recent choice for a proportional electoral system contributes to a greater radicalization of party proposals.

According to current polls, Beppe Grillo’s populist Five Star Movement has the highest chance to lead the next Italian government. The movement wants a political reset and refuses any alliance because of its opposition to the politici di professione (professional politicians). Mr Grillo wants a regulated immigration and a soft European Union, possibly leaving Italy out of the Euro. The programmatic basis of Five Star Movement is very similar to that of Matteo Salvini far right Northern League [8], a Marine Le Pen ally since 2014.

A Political Gamble

The two populist and Eurosceptic parties account for more than 40 per cent of voting intentions. And a growing number of analysis believes it possible a government alliance among Five Star Movement and Northern League after 2018 elections [9]. This hypothesis could lead Italy to extremely critical positions regarding the European integration process, with a government closer to Hungary’s Orbán (and Putin’s Russia) than to Germany or France.

According to the same polls, in this scenario the Democratic Party could lead a center-left post-vote government only if it were able to arrange a large progressive alliance. Mr. Renzi, who was defeated at a constitutional referendum last December and suffered a recent party split, does not seem inclined to do so. It’s finally the former center-right PM Silvio Berlusconi to play the kingmaker role.

Forza Italia’s leader is against mass immigration and in favor of a EU treaty reform, but he has a moderate approach closer to Merkel’s Germany. With his 15 percent, Mr. Berlusconi could decide to rebuild a center-right alliance with Northern League by breaking the extremist axis. Such a coalition could also win the elections, based on current projections. In alternative, Mr. Berlusconi could decide to make a deal with Renzi’s Democrats and give birth to a great coalition government.

What is certain is that anyone wishing to govern Italy should be more or less patriotic on the two issues that are dividing national public opinion. Summing up Grillo, Salvini, Berlusconi and their allies strength, ‘Italians first’ motto is worth more than 60 per cent of consents. A remaining 20-25 percent belongs to a Democratic Party leader who is promising Brussels not to pay Italian EU budget shares without new immigration aides measures.

In the face of the migrant crisis, Italy feels treated as the periphery of Europe. And it is not a fleeting sentiment. A recent Demos survey [10] published on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of Treaties of Rome indicates that only 34 percent of Italian citizens still have trust in European Union, back in the 1998 the figure was 73 percent.

The more Italians feels overlooked by Europe in migrant crisis, the more Eurosceptic position will grow in the electoral polls. It would mean a request for greater border control power, for a Dublin rules on refugees reform and for more identity laws. Every next Italian government will have to take it in account.

""We demand that the transfer of illegal migrants from Italian islands like Lampedusa to the mainland stop"", Kurz was quoted as saying by Austrian news agency APA after the meeting with Alfano.

Kurz also said Austria indents to close its border at the Brenner Pass to secure its border if Italy lets migrants through.

Kurz said the meeting with Alfano was ""correct"" although they did not share ""the same position"".

""If Italy were to continue its timely transfers on the mainland, from which migrants proceed northwards, not only will Central Europe be overwhelmed, but drownings will continue"", Kurz said, noting that rescue operations in the Mediterranean ""should not be a ticket for Central Europe"".

Earlier this month, the Italian foreign ministry summoned the Austrian ambassador to Rome after Vienna said it was ready to deploy up to 750 troops at the Brenner Pass ""very soon"" unless the flow of migrants from Italy diminishes.

A number of mayors across Italy are protesting over the influx of migrants from North Africa as another 7,000 refugees arrived at the weekend.

Three town mayors launched protests, arguing that the country — which has taken 86,123 migrants this year, representing a rise of 10 per cent on the same period last year — is being overwhelmed.

Vincenzo Lionetto Civa, the mayor of Castell’Umberto, a town of 3,200 in Sicily, launched a protest after receiving a call on Friday night warning him that 50 migrants landed by a Spanish charity boat would be housed in an old hotel outside his town.

“The local prefect called me at 9.58pm to tell me they would come, but they were already there,” he said. “The problem isn’t…"

The 11-point plan is expected to be presented in the coming days to some nine NGOs who regularly deploy rescue boats to international waters just off the Libyan coast.

If any group refuses to accept the terms, they risk being barred access to Italian ports, meaning they would have to divert to other countries to disembark any migrants.

Among the proposed new rules will be a ban on making phone calls or firing flares that might signal to human traffickers that they could push their migrant boats out to sea.

The NGO vessels will also be obliged to let police travel with them to help root out any human traffickers hidden amongst the migrants. In addition, the boats will no longer be allowed to transfer refugees to other ships, but will instead have to bring them to port themselves, limiting their operations.

Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, which received a leaked draft of the Italian document, warned that the proposals could have a disastrous impact on the NGO missions.

""Attempts to restrict NGO search and rescue operations risk endangering thousands of lives by limiting rescue boats from accessing the perilous waters near Libya,"" said Iverna McGowan, a senior director with Amnesty International.

Some 85,217 migrants have come to Italy so far this year, according to data released by the interior ministry on Wednesday, up 8.9 percent on the same period in 2016.

Encouraging Sea Crossings?

In all, more than 600,000 newcomers, the majority from sub-Sahara Africa, have reached Italy over the past four years, with tens of thousands more expected in the coming months.

A small flotilla of charity boats have become increasingly important in rescue operations, picking up more than a third of all migrants brought ashore so far this year against less than one percent in 2014, according to the Italian coastguard.

Rome suspects their presence just outside Libyan territorial waters encourages migrants to risk their lives and put to sea. NGOs deny this and say thousands more would die if their boats were not present in the southern Mediterranean.

More than 13,000 people are estimated to have drowned since 2014 trying to make the dangerous crossing to Italy.

The code of conduct will include a categorical ban on NGOs entering Libyan waters unless human life is clearly in danger.

While viewing the NGOs with increasing suspicion, the Italian government has also grown frustrated with its EU allies, saying they are not doing enough to help it tackle the crisis, including by taking in many more of the new arrivals.

Looking to improve cooperation, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni met French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday. However, there was no sign of any pledges to help relieve the pressure on Italy.

""Progress has been made regarding migration policy, but it is not yet sufficient,"" Gentiloni told reporters."

It is worth recalling that parable in full:

A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead. And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side. But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him, and went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee. Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves? (Luke 10:30-36)

The parable offers a clear portrait of what “being a neighbour” should mean, namely coming to the rescue of people in difficult situations and imminent danger, in order to let them recover (if possible), and regain their autonomy.

The parable of the good Samaritan would however look very different if its author had added that a secret deal between the inn-keeper and the robbers was in place, and that to a certain extent even the beaten man was somehow half-aware of the scam in which he plays the admittedly most uncomfortable role (to use an euphemism). It would look even more different if its author added that such a scam was operated on an industrial scale, with the vast complicity of those who were supposed to safeguard the security of that territory, and a plethora of intellectuals and spiritual leaders, who were using the best of their intelligence to envisage narratives providing direct or indirect legitimation for such traffics.

In such a different version of the parable, what would the Samaritan have done? The man was indeed severely beaten and in distress, should he then be rescued?

The parable also indicates that the Samaritan, after providing what may be called “first aid” to the disgraced man, “brought him to an inn”, and “on the morrow […] he departed”. The Samaritan therefore did not take the man as part of his family, in his own house, including the man’s cognates and descendants, for an indefinite future. Nor the Samaritan took the episode as the starting point of a project for promoting a radical political programme in Samaria, one theorising the country’s liquefaction as a political unity in the name of a superior idea of “humanity”, without duly informing and debating with its fellow Samaritans, but under the guise of a rather questionable “necessity”.

The most noble forms of humanitarianism can be summarised in the “thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself” (Matthew 22:39) commandment. However, what is mostly understated in the current reading of this quote is that there cannot be “love”, or better the parental love expressed by the Greek concept of agape, to put it bluntly, without discipline, or rules, or the law (of God, of one’s parents, of the political community, and so on). To express it through Augustine’s words:

Man […] ought to be taught the due measure of loving, that is, in what measure he may love himself so as to be of service to himself. […] Now he is a man of just and holy life who forms an unprejudiced estimate of things, and keeps his affections also under strict control, so that he neither loves what he ought not to love, nor fails to love what he ought to love, nor loves that more which ought to be loved less, nor loves that equally which ought to be loved either less or more, nor loves that less or more which ought to be loved equally. De Doctrina Christiana, I 26-28.

Discipline goes for the love towards the “other”, as much for the love towards “oneself”. The love for oneself does not and cannot transcend from self-discipline, as countless traditions, from Indian to Hellenistic philosophies, to Confucianism, have warned for millennia. As one should love his neighbour as oneself, the same discipline applies.

A further problem with simplistic humanitarianism lies in the persistent gap between possible moral rules governing the single or episodic interaction between individuals, and the adequacy of such rules to make sense of far more recurrent situations. Quantity is quality, and politics differs from ethics precisely, among other elements, on the qualitative differences enhanced primarily by the recurrence of certain episodes. In these cases, the direct transposition of moral thinking into politics remains of limited help, this being the reason behind the resilient separation between ethics and politics, of which the “render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s” (Matthew 22:21) remains the hermetic cypher.

A Blackmail of Horror

In the light of the above, the abnormity of the ongoing human trafficking in the Mediterranean starts to appear as one of the most serious political, criminal, and intellectual blunders in recent European history. The most remarkable element is the almost inexplicable, wide gulf between its media-enhanced image, and what slightly more informed narratives can immediately reveal. Far from being a recent emergency, human trafficking and illegal immigration across the Mediterranean have been continuing at least since the late 1990s. Tragedies such the one where over seven hundred people have drowned already occurred in the waters facing Libya a decade ago and more. Reading the newspapers reporting such episodes reveals the consistency of the Italian (and European) inadequate attitude and initiatives in addressing such phenomenon. A dramatic change has however occurred since the so called Arab Spring in 2011, and even more with the overthrowal of Qaddafi in Libya, which has opened the doors to a flood. However, this is not the entire picture.

Italy has become the most important approach to Europe thank to a series of choices made by the various governments, which have made all this possible. Contrary to those who see the continent as “fortress Europe”, whoever makes it to Italy, remains in Italy and in Europe, indefinitely, independently from any legal status, unless he decides to leave. The major part of Italy’s almost four million non-EU residents has been amnestied, or re-joined amnestied illegal immigrants. Even in the presence of hundreds of thousand illegal entries, the number of people effectively removed from the national territory never exceeded the low thousands. The country’s immigration law, which tied the number of immigrants to the availability of jobs, has never been applied.

This has been the pattern of immigration (non-)policies in Italy at least from the second half of the 1990s. At that time, Italian readers will remember, countless Albanian citizens were illegally crossing the narrow strait separating the countries. What was the response from the Italian government? It was the acceptance of a gigantic operation of human trafficking as a normal, “inevitable” fact. No serious attempt was ever made to govern the phenomenon, with the exclusion of some cosmetic operations. Practically no trafficker was ever punished, despite the recurrence of shipwrecks with hundreds of casualties. Albanian immigration eventually faded when a large part of young adult Albanian population moved to Italy, later to be amnestied, essentially exhausting the emigration basin.

The current phenomenon presents similarities, but also many differences. The main difference it that immigrants are no longer reaching the coast of Italy, nor of Lampedusa, contrary to what is normally to be read in the press. The boats are often a hundred nautical miles away from Lampedusa, and even more from Sicily or mainland Italy. From there, the traffickers (so called scafisti), with a satellite phone, call their contacts in Italy, who in turn call the Coast Guard in Palermo or elsewhere, giving the position of the boat. The Italian Navy and/or Coast Guard then intervene (they have to according to the law), take the immigrants on board, often including the scafisti, and ferry them to Sicily. If they did not intervene, the passengers of the boat would be probably unable to make it back to Libya, or to any shore, thus dying of dehydration, or drowning, or freezing. From a legal viewpoint, it is a perfectly engineered trap, whose steps are all recorded and monitored by the traffickers’ network in Italy, ready for legal action for omission (art. 328 and art. 593, Italian penal code) again the state. From a political and media perspective, it is an equally ingenuous humanitarian blackmail, which exploits, with some obvious risks, the ever-rising tide of unconditioned humanitarianism, against which Europe seems to be unable, and unwilling, to construct a more sober counter-discourse. Of course, any blackmail or threat would never become credible if sometimes the evil which is hinted in the threat did not materialise, namely in this case the death of people in the Mediterranean. Such horrible deaths strengthen the position of the traffickers, by making their threat increasingly credible. This multiplies the efforts to save the boats, which in turn multiplies the boats, and in the long run, the deaths. Italians and European leaders pretend they have not understood this.

Once in Italy, immigrants are routed to “reception centres”, normally run by cooperatives, or even, directly or indirectly, by the Catholic Church. It is almost needless to say that, in a country which is rapidly sinking in the corruption rankings, numerous scandals have demonstrated the emergence of an authentic para-criminal “solidarity industry”, entirely fuelled by public funds (i.e. public debt), possibly one of the fastest growing sectors in the past decade, in a context of economic desolation.

From these centres, they “flee”. They then wander on Italy’s railway system to reach the North of the country, where they re-connect with their networks, and they attempt to cross the borders towards the final destination, mostly the generous welfare of Germany and Sweden. Interesting elements can be added to the story at this juncture. Immigrants have long “won the right” not to be identified by the Italian authorities. If they did, they would not be able to claim asylum or refugee status in Germany or Sweden, as the rules in the Dublin Regulation affirm that such statuses are to be granted by the jurisdiction which first receives the claimants. The immigrants would be therefore deported from Northern Europe to Italy. The results of all this is clearly that Italian authorities, in spite of any contrary international commitment and regulation, have been discharging into the Schengen area from hundreds to thousands of completely unidentified people every week for years. Such policy is hurting Italy’s allies and partners, causing considerable economic damage, security stress, and severe political harm, including the recent collapse of the Swedish government, overwhelmed by a tidal wave of asylum seekers equivalent to around 1% of Sweden’s population in a single year.

While the Italian press invariably and enthusiastically labels such traffics as viaggi della speranza (voyages of hope), a further sign of the intelligentsia’s bad faith, readers will struggle to find information about what happens to the scafisti after they are arrested, who are almost immediately released and sentenced to mild punishments in absentia, even in the case of shipwrecks with hundreds of casualties, or what happens to the boats.

An Orwellian Language

One of the most remarkable features of this story is the systematic creation by the media and political leaders of narratives which accommodate, and foster, such state of affairs. This result is primarily achieved by the enhancement of a veritably Orwellian newspeak grounded in the expansion and manipulation of ethical concepts in a clearly abnormal situation, without any regard for political and strategic consequences. The Italian public in particular has been for many years accustomed to consider accoglienza (“reception” or “hospitality”) as a duty. However, hospitality in this case is stretched to unheard extremes. The idea of hospitality, as already in the ancient world, relates to the visitor and traveller, who stays for a limited period of time, and is protected by traditional and divine precepts (Zeus Xenios). This has of course little or nothing to do with the political problem of large scale population transfers, population re-settlement, population replacement, which form, behind the humanitarian façade, the core of the phenomenon de quo, a phenomenon whose political analysis is continuously hampered by deliberately pushing the individual and/or legalistic viewpoint as the only valuable, in a move leading to the inconclusiveness of any debate.

Related to this point, is the idea that any political position critical of the current immigration policies, and of Lampedusa’s blunder, commits the sin of xenophobia. As in the case of hospitality, the meaning of xenophobia has been ideologically manipulated in order to let it mean something it never did. The xenophobe, literally “the one who fears the guest/foreigner”, is a person irrationally hostile to anything foreign. Xenophobia is a word describing an excessive attitude of closeness with regard to what lies beyond the boundary of one’s political community in a time of normal exchanges and interaction. The irrationality of the xenophobe lies in not understanding that such interactions do not necessarily pose a threat, but they are instead often a welcome occasion for mutual enrichment. In this case again, the focus is on the individual, telling little or nothing about the collective and the political. The problem is that Europeans today do not live in – historically speaking – “normal times” of interactions with the foreigner, but in times when such interactions have surged to a political problem of primary magnitude, which is becoming impossible to deny. Migrations have always occurred, but the idea that unlimited, massive movements of millions of people (and many more to come) is a naturalistic phenomenon, constitutes a clumsy attempt at masquerading policies which appear as the continuation of the worst twentieth century social engineering experiments.

More in general, the often reported idea that “migrations always happened and always will”, with the consequent fatalistic attitude to ongoing events, entirely misses the mark on a number of levels. For most if not all European countries, the quantitative dimension of immigration in recent decades is simply unprecedented. Migrations have historically occurred throughout human history, particularly towards underpopulated areas with untapped natural resources and/or for the purpose of conquest. In none of such cases mass migrations have been unproblematic and peaceful. The determinism of the unavoidable human migration argument, if of any value, should then also extend to its direct and indirect consequences. This very determinism, more in general, seems to be at odds with the fundamental idea that politics, albeit “the realm of the possible”, can be steered by human will, without which any talk about government and its forms, including “democracy”, becomes pointless.

Other explanatory genres, which tend to see mass migrations as a way to balance economic inequalities and/or past wrongdoings, particularly colonisation, miss the point that these cannot constitute solutions for past and present woes, nor are the recipe for a “better world”. Even if a healthy critique of capitalism and/or globalisation (however defined) were to be embraced, one cannot but noticed the regrettable tendency to employ it as a deterministic explanation format, as a theological insh’Allah, which ends up producing an upside-down ideological legitimation for any policy, while humanity should faithfully await an eschatological as much as utopian liberation, one that constantly shifts farther into the distant future.

Solidarity has been another victim of ideological manipulation. An expression of the piety and empathy, if turned into a policy, it cannot simply be articulated as an unconditioned duty – outside the cases of extreme necessity, irreversible and chronic disease. It must always contain limits, conditions, guarantees, and a clear idea of its quantitative dimension. Unlimited, unconditional, unquestioning forms of solidarity are morally naïve and exposed to the obvious risk of parasitism.

Distorted Images of Places and People

Besides the manipulation of concepts, producing a legitimating narrative for the current predicament passes through the creation of disputable images of places, and of people.

Already for a number of years, in all main European languages the word “migrant” has replaced any former denomination, particularly “immigrant” (immigrato, Einwanderer), which contained a clearer sense of direction into the territorial dimension of a state, thus undermining the conceptual in/out difference. Crucially the concept of migrant relies on the previously exposed idea of human migration as a sheer naturalistic phenomenon with no political design, or implication. It has also limited any meaningful distinction between the ways and reasons why borders are crossed, whether legally, or illegally, or for a grounded humanitarian necessity (refugees, asylum seekers), or in absence of any such requisite.

A more recent twist has taken place with the ongoing crisis in the Mediterranean, whereby the “migrants” have suddenly been all labelled as profughi (“the ones who flee”), without any enquiry on whether the factual and legal presuppositions for defining them as such are in place, and to allow them a legal entry to the Schengen area. It appears that in reality, according to the European Union, only a small fraction of those arrived in Europe via Lampedusa can qualify for the status of refugee or for political asylum. Consequently, their demands are likely to be rejected and they should be taken back to the country where the entered the EU, namely Italy. The vast majority of immigrants, in other words, comes from countries where there is no immediate danger for their lives, nor serious, large scale violation of human rights to justify their permanence as refugees.

European and particularly Italian media have been restlessly working on the creation of a fictitious image of the African continent. According to it, Africa is a massive concentration camp of unlimited, inexplicable violence, torture and death (it is never entirely clear who is perpetrating it, and for what reasons), without any place to escape, or to live. The only possibility for every single person in Africa is to leave to other parts of the word. However, there are many possible immediate counter-narratives. In the days when several hundred people drowned off the Libyan coast, African leaders gathered together with their Asian peers in Bandung (Indonesia), to discuss the continuous expansion of South-South cooperation, trade, joint development, and investments. Particularly in the past decade and half, numerous African nations gained the top ranks among the fastest-growing economies in the world. Countries in Western Africa, where numerous immigrants are coming from, such as Ghana and Nigeria, have become centres of very rapid development. While many challenges persists, a certain consensus is emerging around the idea that most African nations will attain middle income status by the mid of the current century, barring major trend disruptions. If it is undeniably true that poverty and economic underdevelopment remain extremely widespread, the picture of Africa as an unliveable place is completely misleading. This also goes for the presence and persistence of military conflicts, whose number and intensity has vastly declined almost everywhere from the 1990s. Statistically, the risk of dying in a shipwreck in the Mediterranean is several orders of magnitude higher than that of suffering a violent and premature death in Africa or the Middle East.

If a distorted image of the African continent has been fabricated in order to fit a certain narrative, so it is the image of Europe. Europe is the specular image of Africa’s desolation, a place forever free from serious political and security questions (an outdated, but diehard legacy of a post-historical vision à la Fukuyama), and where, inexplicably, prosperity is a given for all residents, and whatever group of people comes to Europe, will enjoy it for the simple fact of its geographic relocation. An illustration of the problematic sides of this vision, which are becoming all too apparent, does not need to be re-iterated here.

The European Union, as in the case of other national problems, constitutes a valuable tool for shifting responsibilities and create deliberately deceptive accounts of the crisis. On the one hand, Europe is supposed to be committed to the unlimited, unconditioned “humanitarian” policies of unquestioning hospitality, this being a constitutive part of its “core values”. Here is a clever mix of half-truths and overstatements: Europe has been historically conceived as a community of nation states according to the principle of subsidiarity, where certain “humanitarian values” are present, but they cannot trump basic security and strategic concerns, nor the idea that social phenomena are ruled by laws passed according to constitutionally determined mechanisms, including those norms regulating immigration, asylum status or refugees, and not by the emotional, sensationalistic drive of political radicalism trying to spread the idea the all borders are immoral, therefore there should not exist, whatever the consequences.

Particularly the Italian media and political leaders are engaged in a pathetic “double game”. In order to deceive the Italian audience, they decry “Europe’s selfishness” and the stubborn anti-immigration attitude of the main EU partners. They fantasise about absurd measures, such as spreading illegal immigrants and legitimate refugees/asylum seekers alike all over the continent, pretending to ignore that this would be the capitulation to human trafficking, a huge political blunder, and it will not be accepted by any European state, which will certainly never be inclined to put their national security in the hands of the continent’s most corrupted bureaucracies, one of the reasons why this traffic exists in the first place.

At the same time though, in the official diplomatic and international legal agreements, the very same leaders never officially questioned the rules of the Dublin Regulation, and so the principle that the EU has external borders which have to be guarded, monitored and defended.

Who profits for the fabrication of these narratives? In the short term, as already clear from the various scandals and deficiencies mentioned above, those who have advanced their agenda and achieved to channel public resources towards the (however patchy) management of this emergency, to whose appearance and expansion they continuously contribute. Secondly, such narratives are to be understood in the context of path dependence in the “humanitarian” interpretation of the Other exclusively as a victim, bound to remain a victim so forever, as “bare life”. In the long run however, considering the destabilising effects of rapid, massive and undesired population movements, nobody should seriously be thinking of receiving any gain from the continuation of current trends.

Policies and Trajectories

It has been immediately clear that the recent tragedies in the Mediterranean have not changed the course of events, nor the policies which particularly the Italian government is going to pursue. Authorities in Rome have instantly re-iterated the above-described, essentially pointless idea of a “common European effort”, whose non-existent positive effects have been for everybody to see in the past few years. The promised “war on the traffickers”, in a world of ubiquitous espionage and electronic surveillance, is immediately depicted as an impossible task. The situation is therefore likely to worsen, especially when increasing numbers non-qualifying asylum seekers will be deported back to Italy. In the long run Italy, by failing to comply with its international obligations, may find itself excluded from the Schengen area, also considering that many of its policies seems to be almost designed to hurt its Northern European partners.

As in recent weeks many proposals have been advanced on how to find a solution for the severe situation of trafficking and illegal immigration in the Mediterranean, it is arguable that no “solution” can be envisaged within the current “humanitarian” conceptual horizon. While authentic human tragedies are indeed occurring, European naivety, short-sightedness and fixation on electoral politics impede the formulation of a broader vision. The first step in order to stop human trafficking and the consequent humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean is to change the way it is narrated and thought about. The colossal dimension of its organisation, which is simply unthinkable without vast complicities in the Italian institutions, has to be weighted as a sign of the severe degradation of territorial control from the part of the state, a void of authority which is being filled by unaccountable and aggressive forces, such as transnational criminal networks. Europe needs to face the ineffectiveness of its methods in dealing with actors who are ready to violate and abuse legal rules issued by institutions whose legitimacy they do not recognise, while are willing to die and kill to reach their goals.

The sheer quantitative dimension of the phenomenon is indicative of how humanitarianism can be exploited on an industrial scale, particularly forcing the hand of institutions by means of well-engineered blackmail, and organised violence (e.g. against identification, or deportation procedures), which are impossible to resist in the current political-cultural landscape. Consequently, humanitarianism has been weaponised, and illegal mass immigration is in the process of becoming a primary instrument of asymmetric warfare.

The deaths in the Mediterranean will cease only when the trafficking will be brought to an end, and the political actors, both in Italy/Europe and in Africa, who are making it possible, will be neutralised. Chances that this will occur in the next future are, however, very small. The Italian government has continuously resisted the idea that the country is in the presence of an asymmetric threat, but only of a humanitarian crisis. It has therefore failed to mobilise those resources which can stop the trafficking. Instead of envisaging nonsensical Europe-wide policies which will never materialise, Rome should have called for protection and assistance upon the US, its main ally, the one for which Italy has sent its troops to fight and die in counterproductive and pointless wars, the same wars, largely opposed by public opinion in Europe, which are destabilising the southern bank of the Mediterranean, and, particularly for the Libya campaign of 2011, which destroyed vital security interests of Italy, and (as it should be clear by now) of Europe. The US, whose Sixth Fleet is the most powerful in the Mediterranean, has the intelligence assets and the freedom of manoeuvre to influence the situation in Libya, if they wanted to, much more effectively than any European initiative.

It should also be noticed that the current situation constitutes a completely abnormal, very dangerous misuse of the sea, and an obvious threat to maritime security, which, given the continuous reinforcement of the organisations behind the trafficking, may naturally evolve into full-blown piracy and an immediate threat to Sicily and southern Italy.

The severity of the situation lies not only in today’s escalating numbers, but much more in possible future movement of incalculable masses, which the current show of weakness is encouraging. It should be clear that political authorities are playing in this instance with historical forces, namely those of political demography, whose magnitude they are grossly underestimating, and which may easily lead to their (non-metaphorical) ruin. This is not electoral politics, but a matter of utmost historical impact. If such is the predicament in 2015, what will it be in 2025 and beyond? Epochal challenges require a deep strategic vision, courage, and toughness, qualities which are in stark contrast to the despicable feebleness routinely shown by European leaders, encouraging further aggression.

In conclusion, even in the face of the horrors and the tragic loss of life, allowing or even encouraging the spread of chaos by yielding to blackmail is always the wrong policy, it is morally and philosophically inacceptable, nor it may be considered a correct way to show compassion and love to the fellow human, precisely in reason its disorderly, unregulated, and fundamentally corrupt process. It can only lead to further blackmail. The good neighbour and the morally cultivated person is not the one who asks no question, pretends not to be aware of the frauds operated to his detriment, and wraps himself with multiple layers of self-deception. Even the Good Samaritan will not be able escape the strategic aspects of political life indefinitely."

Professore, partiamo dall'inizio, per capire le regole del gioco: secondo lei, ha ancora senso leggere i risultati elettorali in base all'asse destra-sinistra?

No, non ha molto senso. Non perché destra e sinistra non esistano più, ma perché ci sono due destre e due sinistre. E, cosa ancora più stupefacente, alcune somiglianze fra segmenti della destra e della sinistra sono ancora più forti delle affinità all’interno dei due schieramenti tradizionali.

Partiamo da qui.

In molti Paesi, ad esempio, la sinistra riformista e la destra liberale sono molto vicine nella loro accettazione del mercato, della globalizzazione, delle regole sovranazionali. E la sinistra e la destra populiste sono assai simili nel comune rifiuto di alcuni aspetti della globalizzazione, anche se spesso le cose che si respingono non sono le medesime: la sinistra populista è ostile alla circolazione dei capitali e all’ingerenza delle autorità sovranazionali negli affari interni dei vari paesi, la destra populista è invece ostile alla circolazione delle persone, e in particolare all’immigrazione. Né si può dire che queste strane convergenze siano solo sulla carta: sono ormai parecchi gli esperimenti di grosse koalition, con destra e sinistra ufficiali al governo insieme (Germania, Austria, Italia, Grecia, Israele). Né mancano gli avvicinamenti fra forze populiste, sia al governo (si pensi alla coalizione rosso-nera che governa attualmente la Grecia) sia all’opposizione (si pensi alla convergenza, in Italia, fra Lega e Cinque Stelle su un tema come quello dell’immigrazione). Per questo, nel mio libro suggerisco che la dicotomia fondamentale, in questa epoca, non sia più quella fra destra e sinistra ma stia diventando quella fra forze dell’apertura, ovvero destra e sinistra ufficiali, e forze della chiusura, ovvero populisti di destra e di sinistra."

This joining of forces long seemed unthinkable (and, for many, unpalatable). But the rise of the two parties in the polls — and the disintegration of mainstream forces — increases the odds of a government in Rome that, among more unconventional steps, promises to take the country out of the eurozone.

When Italians go to the polls, no later than early 2018, the 5Stars could well win the vote but fail to secure a big enough majority to govern. The party founded by comedian Beppe Grillo had long pledged to rule only on its own and shun coalitions in favor of staying in the opposition.

This revolutionary principle is being reconsidered. According to top-level insiders, the 5Stars’ leadership is already working on a Plan B in case it lacks the votes, as is likely, to govern by itself. Such a plan, partially confirmed in public comments by some lawmakers, would include a parliamentary alliance with the anti-immigrant Northern League and other smaller populist parties, such as the far-right Brothers of Italy.

“We want to run alone at the next elections, as we always did, and we target a 40 percent win, which would allow us to obtain the mandate to form a new government,” Alessandro Di Battista, one of the leaders of the movement, told POLITICO.

“If that doesn’t happen, and we get less than 40 percent of the vote, we’ll be ready to explain our platform in parliament and submit it to all the other parties. Then it will be their responsibility to say Yes or No to a government led by the 5Stars.”

The leaders of the 5Stars insist they would reject any old-school backroom deal or trading of political seats in exchange for parliamentary backing.

A populist triumph in Italy would be as shocking to the European establishment as any outcome in this year of elections, including a victory by Marine Le Pen in France this spring. Between them, the 5Stars and Northern League back a cocktail of policies considered anathema by Brussels.

“The plan [for a populist alliance] is there and it’s being discussed in the parliament’s corridors,” said a person familiar with the situation. “What remains to be seen is how and if it’s going to work once in place, and what the junior partners will ask in exchange for their parliamentary support to a possible 5Star government.”

The leaders of the 5Stars insist they would reject any old-school backroom deal or trading of political seats in exchange for parliamentary backing.

“That’s old politics and we just want to erase it,” said Luigi Di Maio, the 30-year-old deputy leader of the lower house and a possible 5Star prime ministerial candidate. “Any alliance will be based on our program and will be done in parliament, where the votes are.”

If the coalition call comes, the Northern League, led by the outspoken and social media-savvy Matteo Salvini, is ready to at least consider it — as long as any potential suitor is ready to back his battle against “a disastrous European Union and its harmful policies,” which he says have led Italy toward poverty and political irrelevance.

Salvini has transformed the League from a struggling separatist party into a national political force, along the lines of Le Pen’s National Front, hammering home three messages: no euro, no immigrants, and lower taxes.

On some grounds, a 5Star-Northern League alliance seems a natural fit. Both rage against Italy’s elite and European bureaucracy, and there is growing convergence between the 5Stars’ anti-euro, anti-globalization stance and that of the Northern League.

Salvini and 5Star founder Grillo even share a fondness for Russia’s Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump.

But it would be a risky marriage for both parties, who would have to overcome their remaining differences and form a government strong enough to produce a bold and realistic agenda, able to address the needs of a country mired in debt, with moribund growth and stark social divisions.

“We remain open to dialogue, but I still see many differences between us and the 5Stars,” Salvini said. “Obviously, if they change their minds and prove to be interested in reaching a compromise, we are here, ready to listen.”

However, Salvini has concerns. “We have completely different views on how to defend our borders from the immigrants’ wave. Not to mention labor and fiscal policies: The 5Stars want social handouts for people who don’t work. We want to cut taxes for companies that invest in hiring workers. That’s a big difference.”

On the up

At Italy’s 2013 general election, the 5Stars came from nowhere to become the second most popular party. Despite a few ups and downs along the way, its poll ratings have remained steady at around 30 percent, generally ahead of a divided center-right and, more recently, slightly ahead of the center-left Democratic Party (PD) of former premier Matteo Renzi.

According to a recent Ipsos poll, the movement is polling at a record high of 32.3 percent — a 5 percentage point lead over the PD. That’s likely in part down to the role the 5Stars played in the success of the No campaign ahead of a constitutional referendum last year that cost Renzi his job. In the Ipsos poll, the Northern League remained steady at around 13 percent, well up on the meager 4 percent it scored in the 2013 elections.

If a 5Star election win is a concern for many, fears of a 5Star-Northern League deal are even greater.

Many European partners, however, fear that a 5Star election win would put Italy’s economic and political stability at risk because of its lack of experience and unclear agenda — and their fears haven’t been assuaged by the 5Stars’ shaky management of Rome since Virginia Raggi won mayoral elections last June. Raggi has been rocked by corruption scandals and though the 5Star leadership has so far defended the mayor, it knows that failure in the capital doesn’t bode well for its chances of governing nationally.

That’s not the only concern. Critics and supporters note that Grillo’s movement has been pushing an increasingly inconsistent political platform of late: it has backtracked from wanting to take Italy out of the EU and even tried (unsuccessfully) to forge an alliance in the European Parliament with the Liberal group of arch-federalist Guy Verhofstadt — leaving it to continue its European alliance with Nigel Farage’s UKIP.

“The lack of clarity and political coherence, which has proved successful for the 5Stars as a pure protest movement, now risks undermining their ambitions to govern, as their traditional electorate resist the need for transforming what was an exceptional protest group into a real party, fit for office,” said Massimiliano Panarari, a professor at Rome’s LUISS University

If a 5Star election win is a concern for many, fears of a 5Star-Northern League deal are even greater.

The two parties would face “immediate contrasts,” said Panarari. “But above all, they would have to quickly tackle the need to transform their radical and often impracticable plans into realistic economic and social policies, able to push Italy out of one of its deepest crisis.”

One obvious area of division is membership of the single currency. The Northern League has dropped calls for a referendum on exiting the eurozone, saying such a move would have no constitutional relevance, while the 5Stars maintain their long-standing pledge to hold an anti-euro referendum.

They are, however, slightly closer on immigration than they were, with the 5Stars taking a much harder stance of late. Italy “can’t become Europe’s refugee camp,” 5Star lawmaker Sergio Battelli said Thursday, calling for EU sanctions against countries that refuse to accept refugees, but also for bilateral agreements to speed-up economic migrants’ repatriations.

The 5Stars have had great success attracting disaffected voters from both right and left. Now, one of the leading anti-establishment forces in Europe has to preserve and widen its electoral base as it fights to become a governing force — a process that often leads to painful compromises and hard electoral choices.

According to Roberto D’Alimonte, politics professor at Florence University, “without a broad alliance among the main parties, either on the left or on the right side, the result at the next elections will be just chaos.”"

Fundamentalist Islamic leaders have formed a biker gang in Germany modeled after the Hells Angels to protect Muslims from a perceived growth of hatred toward Islam.

Perceived growth 0f hatred towards Islam translation: opposition to jihad terror and the brutal sharia. In other words, this is a new front, a new army formation to wage jihad on the kuffar.

Joshua Gill, Daily caller Foundation on July 31, 2017:

Fundamentalist Islamic leaders have formed a biker gang in Germany modeled after the Hells Angels to protect Muslims from a perceived growth of hatred toward Islam.

The gang, known as Germany’s Muslims, formed in May under the leadership of Marcel Kunst, a German convert who changed his name to Mahmud Salam, according to Gatestone Institute (GI) Monday.

Kunst is a known Salafist — a fundamentalist Muslim whose goal is to institute Sharia law in Germany. A statement on the gang’s Facebook page claiming non-violence, translated by GI, reads as follows:

Our organization has been founded for only one purpose: To protect and support our brothers and sisters from the ever-growing hatred of Islam!!! To all non-Muslims who read this post, pay attention. The following could change your perception of us!!! We respect every religion and, as dictated by the Quran, do not force our faith on anyone!!! We do not sympathize with the Islamic State and are against compulsion in faith and in marriage!!! ISLAM DOES NOT RECOGNIZE HONOR KILLINGS AS IS OFTEN SUPPOSED!!! The raised finger in our logo is not from the so-called Islamic State. In our faith it symbolizes that there is only one God!!! We have summarized 40 commandments from the Quran for you….IMPORTANT. Whoever gets into a fight on the road or elsewhere (except for self-defense) will be expelled from our group without further discussion!!!

German authorities identified several of the gang’s senior leaders, in addition to Kunst, as Salafists, including a gang “sergeant” who was detained by police July 2 during the Tour de France when the race passed through Mönchengladbach, where the gang was founded. Police issued a warning to the gang’s leadership that vigilanteism would not be tolerated.

“So far, we have no evidence that they are a danger, but we are keeping our eyes on them,” said Isabella Hannen, spokeswoman for the Mönchengladbach Police Department, to Die Welt.

The gang has been viewed with heavy suspicion by locals in light of Islamic vigilante groups who posed a threat to German communities over recent years, according to GI.

One such group, the self-styled “Sharia Police,” began patrolling German communities in 2016, urging Muslims and non-Muslims alike to adhere to Sharia law, and even passed out leaflets in the section of one town to declare it a “Sharia controlled zone.” A group of about a hundred Islamists also began enforcing Sharia law with violent means in a Chechen community in Berlin.

A report on Salafist violence from the German domestic intelligence agency BfV stated that Salafists threaten to escalate the level of violent civil unrest that already threatens German communities.

“The potential threat posed by Salafist violence remains dangerously high,” the report reads. “Salafist violence could create an additional dynamic through interactions with extremist groups from other ‘hostile’ ideological camps, as already occurred in individual cases in the past.”"

Why would he feel so compelled to term them – Fundamentalist, right at the very beginning, when it is clearly not essential to the issue?

They reason these sack-of-shts do this is to absolve muslims. If every muslim who commits an unsavory act, is labelled a – Fundamentalist, or extremist, then a separate category is created, in which they can dump all muslims who commit unpleasant acts. No matter how many of them do it, and no matter how many times.

In this way, the rest of the muslims, who have not committed these acts, are shielded perfectly. Dimwits see a muslim terrorizing – Bam! “He must be a fundamentalist. Ergo – Regular muslims are fine”.

And voila, just like that, muslims get away scot-free, no one blames them for anything, and it continues the same way perpetually. This is the rationale that helps muslims remain impervious – To label all disreputable muslims – Extremists, or fundamentalists, creating a separate category, and dumping them all in it, thereby vindicating muslims at large.

It will forever continue this way. We are brain-dead. We will never get up off our arses and give them what they truly deserve. Furthermore, we ourselves will never understand that labelling muslims as such is tantamount to a perfect defense of muslims."

Are we all just a cattle to the Muslims? Does the undeclared victory of the Albanian Mafia over the Italian Mafia stand related to the demise of Roman Catholicism in the face of Islam’s youthful aggression? After all, the decline of La Cosa Nostra, on display ever since the spectacular Gotti trials in New York and Judge Falcone’s mass mob trials in the bunker court in Sicily, was concomitant with the rise in Albanian Mafia activity in the 1990’s in Kosovo, Montenegro, Macedonia, and Italy. The Italians of Crime Inc. even in their depraved state were still men with scruples while the Albanians suffered from no such restraints, certainly thanks to Islam in no small part. Of course, the Albanian tribal links have enforced a sense of loyalty, because betrayal is punished by a mutually agreed upon punishment of death. Just ask the FBI who investigated them. Thousands of Albanians and others who fled the Balkans for the United States in recent years have emerged as a serious organized crime problem, displacing La Cosa Nostra (LCN) families as kingpins of U.S. crime.

The Albanian criminal enterprises, operating largely in New York and other Eastern seaboard cities, represent a major challenge because of their propensity for violence and brutality. They are a hardened group, operating with reckless abandon just as they have done in the Balkans against the Serbs and their allies in Kosovo where they assisted a local Albanian terrorist organization known as “Kosovo Liberation Army” (KLA/UCK) in the 1990’s. Some of the Albanians even served as ruthless sociopathic enforcers for the established Italian Mafia families for several years. Certain crimes the La Cosa Nostra had the Albanians commit for them because these acts would be too gruesome and too dangerous for the Italians to do. In the Albanian tradition of table manners, it is normal to expect a knife pulled to settle disputes. They do mean business just like their ancient counterparts did, those religious killers from the infamous Arab Muslim sect of Hashishin (Assassins) in the Middle East who excelled in murdering eminent Christians and Muslims in the name of Allah (usually at high levels).

What makes Albanians so hard to track down is that unlike the traditional model of the criminal enterprise, here there is no single, ethnically homogeneous Albanian or Balkan “mafia” structured hierarchically in the manner of traditional Sicilian or Italian mafia. Contrary to common belief, no strict hierarchy exists within ethnic Albanian criminal groups, and there are no godfathers. And why? The answer: ISLAM. It is the horizontal nature of Islam’s worldview that colors the perception of the Albanian crime syndicates, even if their members are not particularly religious. In this, there is a clear structural dissimilarity with the Catholic Italian Mafia where hierarchy was honorable and instrumental to the functioning of the system. There is no such thing as a hierarchy in the flat world of opportunity for crimes under the auspices of the Islamic Mafia of the tribal Albanian terrorist entrepreneurs. Each family, each tribe, each helter-skelter band of Albanian toughs is liable to form its own criminal enterprise cell – just as had happened in the centuries past when Albanian brigands were dreaded even by the Turks who knew them as mountain bandits and tough skinned shepherds coming together for the opportune purpose of ambushing caravans, kidnapping travelers, slaughtering all defenders. The endemic Albanian stagecoach robbery operations inside the Balkan provinces of the old Turkish Empire were the bane of travel and the shame of the Sultans.

Fast forward to today, while these cells do admit non-Albanian associates – they do not allow them into the inner circle of decision-making where teams of experienced pimps and hardened killers run their respective cells like Muslim fathers run Muslim families – with the power of ‘honor killings’ at their fingertips. The Balkan region remains a safe haven for these profit-driven Albanian criminal terror groups, fighting not so much for Allah but for money and political influence for Allah’s family of worshipers on Earth. Intellectually speaking, the Albanian crime groups stand for a horizontal group of values in which peer-to-peer relationships in the service of an equal opportunity to pull a job on the order of trafficking in drugs, arms, humans, and human organs – is what constitutes its modus operandi (MO). They just gather for the job at hand. Then after it’s done, they disappear until another job prospect would unite them again, each time the cell would be staffed a little differently under the command of a senior man of experience for the job acting as the cell leader. All this wealth from crime has a political purpose too. The Albanian-American Mafia in New York was instrumental in helping elect Hillary Clinton to the Senate from a won seat in upstate New York. She received both money and votes from a 200,000-strong Albanian community in New York. It was certainly a kind of payback for her role in the great bombing of Serbia in 1999.

To illustrate the kinds of known criminal projects that the Albanian Mafia is famous for, let us recall that huge scandal involving illegal organ theft in the post-NATO-war-on-Serbia period when individual Serb civilians were being hunted down, made captive and cut open for kidneys, livers, and hearts that could be sold on the shadowy organ transplant black markets in Europe (just as it has been done during the war on kidnapped or captured Serb soldiers who were gutted across the border in a shack of horrors in Albania). Not too long ago, Council of Europe reporter Dick Marty alleged in a hard-hitting 2010 paper that senior KLA commanders – including the recent Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci – were involved in illegal organ trafficking. This is all connected to the Medicos affair, another case of organ trafficking at a hospital in Kosovo’s main city Pristina. Seven people, mostly doctors, were on trial and convicted before an EU-run court there on charges of illegally transplanting organs at the Medicus Clinic. The suspicions first appeared in the media in a book, “The Hunt: Me and the War Criminals”, written in 2008 by Carla Del Ponte, a reputable former chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). In her book, a credible Del Ponte states that Kosovo Albanians harvested organs of kidnapped ethnic Serbs after the armed conflict ended in 1999. Moreover, after the war in Kosovo, an American journalist, Michael Montgomery, obtained testimony from seven former KLA terrorists who said they had transported prisoners, dead and alive, from Kosovo to Albania for organ harvesting on live victims.

Just as the Qur’an instructed “the elevated Muslims”: treat the infidel like the cattle that they are.

“Indeed, the worst of living animals in the sight of Allah are those who have disbelieved, and they will not [ever] believe.”

[The Holy Qur’an, Chapter 8, verse 56, surat l-anfal (The Spoils of War)]

According to a hadith (sayings of the Prophet of Islam) recorded among other places in Sunan Ahmed (Hanbali jurisprudence) and Sunan al-Bayhaqi (Shafi’i jurisprudence), during the course of a discussion about non-Muslims, Caliph Omar al-Khattab — one of Sunni Islam’s “four righteous caliphs” — declared “They are heathens, and the blood of one of them is [like] the blood of a dog.”"

s than a call to kill another person. Except, apparently, at The Washington Post.

On July 21, imams Ammar Shahin of the Islamic Center of Davis (ICD) and Mahmoud Harmoush of Islamic Center of Riverside gave speeches calling for the destruction of the Jews in the context of the recent violence centered around the Temple Mount. Both imams called on Allah “to liberate Al Aqsa from the Jews.”

The speeches were brought to light by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), which picked them up from the YouTube channels of both Islamic centers.

After exposure by MEMRI, news of one or both of the offending sermons were picked up The Jerusalem Post, the National Review, The Times of Israel, the Jewish Journal, the Free Beacon and various pro-Israel blogs, including Legal Insurrection and The Tower. There appears to be little or no national coverage given during the week to the sermons. (The local Davis Enterprise reported on it in middle of last week, but most national news organizations didn’t touch the story until Friday.)

Ignoring the Controversy

On Friday, Michelle Boorstein, the Post’s religion reporter covered the apology of Sheikh Ammar Shahin, the imam of the mosque, at the Islamic Center of Davis (ICD), in California, for giving an anti-Semitic sermon a week earlier.

For a full week The Washington Post was silent about this crude anti-Semitism. Only a week later did the Post cover it and a number of things are readily apparent.

The Post only reported once Shahin offered a dubious apology. The Post never reported on Harmoush’s sermon. Harmoush did not apologize. The Post reported uncritically a false claim made by Shahin and one of his supporters. The Post got an expert to reinterpret part of his sermon so that it was somewhat less offensive.

The first two items are related. The news, which was first reported by MEMRI, on July 21 was that two California imams gave virulently anti-Semitic speeches calling for the killing of the Jews. That was the news.

The Post had a whole week to be aware of this news before Shahin’s “apology” press conference, but only reported on the sermon once an apology was in hand and damage control effort had begun. The fact that the speech by Harmoush, who to the best of my knowledge never apologized, was ignored makes it less likely that this was an accident.

Reporting the Apology with Sympathy, and Ignoring Root Causes

In the course of the article Boorstein reported ,”In the hour-long sermon, the 31-year-old Shahin focused on the standoff at the site and called Muslims to come together to protest the closure there.”

Later she quoted a worshiper from the mosque who said that he was disgusted “by the action of the Israeli government in preventing Muslim people from doing their prayers in the Masjid Al-Aqsa.”

But it wasn’t the Israeli government that closed the mosque (except in the immediate aftermath of the killings of two police officers there by a gang of three terrorists), Muslims stayed away from the mosque on account of boycott called by the head of the Waqf, the Jordanian religious trust that administers the site.

(I pointed this out to Boorstein on Twitter, she responded that it wasn’t her job to correct the inaccuracies as she linked to the reporting from Israel and this story was about what happened in Davis. Shahin, as her own reporting attests, made the false claim, so its inaccuracy is central to the story and should have been reported on.)

In case people were unconvinced by Shahin’s apology:

A Northern California imam whose widely distributed sermon about Jews in disputed Jerusalem set off controversy and fear of violence apologized at a Friday news conference, saying his words were hurtful and “unacceptable.” “To the Jewish community, here in Davis and beyond, I say this: I am deeply sorry for the pain that I have caused. The last thing I would do is intentionally hurt anyone, Muslim, Jewish or otherwise. It is not in my heart, nor does my religion allow it,” Ammar Shahin said in his statement. … “Commitment to defending religious rights in Jerusalem should not cause division or fan the flames of anti-Semitism,” Shahin said at Friday’s news conference. “Today, I commit to working harder and will join efforts for mutual understanding and building bridges. As a young religious leader, this has humbled me.”

Boorstein got an expert to re-translate part of Shahin’s speech so it would fit the imam’s new interpretation:

Nazir Harb Michel, a senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding in Arab and Islamic Studies, translated one passage in the imam’s sermon this way: “O God, liberate the al-Aqsa mosque from the desecrations of the Jews. O God, upon you is the handling of those who closed the al-Aqsa mosque. O God, defeat each of them and count them all, and don’t leave any of them out.”

That’s certainly not as offensive as:

Oh Allah, support the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the rest of the Muslim lands. Oh Allah, liberate the Al-Aqsa Mosque from the filth of the Jews. Oh Allah, destroy those who closed the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Oh Allah, show us the black day that You inflict upon them, and the wonders of Your ability. Oh Allah, count them one by one and annihilate them down to the very last one. Do not spare any of them.

but I suspect that Michel is taking a good deal of literary license with his interpretation. Is it a reporter’s job to seek advocates of a controversial figure and republish those remarks uncritically?

What no one seems to dispute is that elsewhere in the speech Shahin spoke in very unambiguous terms about the destruction of the Jews.

When that war breaks out, they will run and hide behind every rock, and house, and wall, and trees. The house, the wall, and the trees will call upon the Muslims. It will say: Oh Muslim… It will not say: Oh Palestinian, oh Egyptian, oh Syrian, oh Afghan, oh Pakistani, oh Indian… No, it will say: Oh Muslim. Muslim. When Muslims come back… ‘Come, there is someone behind me – except for the Gharqad tree, which is the tree of the Jews. Except for a certain tree that they are growing today in Palestine, in that area, except this form of tree, which they are growing today… That’s the tree that will not speak to the Muslims.

This hadith (saying attributed to Mohammed), along with some embellishments added by Shahin, is one that is cited in the Hamas covenant, saying that all Jews will be destroyed on Judgment day.

Furthermore, it may be possible to excuse Shahin if all he said that his call for Allah to deal with the Jews. But he said more than that. Shahin also prayed, “Oh Allah, make this happen by our hands. Let us play a part in this.” This isn’t simply a prayer for God to settle accounts with the Jews, it is literally a call to arms of his listeners to physically take part in liberating Al Aqsa.

It looks like Boorstein did her best to reduce Shahin’s inflammatory sermon to a political commentary delivered by someone who was understandably upset by the actions of the Israeli government.

CAIR is Silent

There are three other points worth noting.

The first is that a representative of CAIR of Sacramento Valley was quoted in the Post article:

Basim Elkarra, executive director of the Sacramento chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, said that the Jewish and Muslim communities in the area have a history of “strong relations.” He added, “Working together, we’ll get through this.” Of the imam, he said it was essential for “people to realize words matter, words have consequences.”

If you check CAIR Sacramento Valley Facebook and Twitter feeds, you will find no condemnation of Shahin’s hate speech. On Twitter, they describe themselves as “Leading advocates for justice and mutual understanding.”

MEMRI Rebuts Allegations made by Islamic Center

As noted in the Post article the ICD mosque attacked MEMRI:

In the context of the full sermon, it becomes clear that the theme of the sermon was against oppression, and not against Jews or any religion,” the mosque statement said. “If MEMRI and company sincerely followed Imam Ammar Shahin’s work and did not just cut and paste what suits their cause, they would have come across the countless lectures and sermons he has given regarding treating all people, especially non-Muslims, with kindness and giving them their full rights, supporting them when they are oppressed.”

A longer attack on MEMRI was published on the ICD YouTube page on which the July 21 sermon was published. Part of it reads:

MEMRI, an extremist agenda driven organization that supports Israel’s occupation of Palestinian land, and other Islamophobic news organizations, accused Imam Shahin of anti-Semitism, quoting edited, mistranslated, passages of the sermon out of context. If the sermon was misconstrued, we sincerely apologize to anyone offended. We will continue our commitment to interfaith and community harmony. MEMRI’s video included an edited segment about a Prophetic tradition dealing with the apocalyptic battle between Jesus and the Antichrist. Prophetic traditions addressing the end of times are not meant to address modern conflicts, the Imam was using the tradition to address unity and coming back to the faith.

If Shahin’s apology were sincere, he would not have attacked MEMRI. The fact that he apologized (or claimed to apologize) shows that his comments were not taken out of context.

Furthermore the fact that a contemporary terrorist group (Hamas) used the same hadith that Shahin used, shows that the call to murder can’t be dismissed as a “prophetic vision.”

MEMRI responded to the latter attack:

Imam Shahin is one of a group of extremist preachers who have been exposed by MEMRI to be delivering incitement to hatred and violence (see AppendixII for list of these). Like the others, after being exposed, Imam Shahin and the Islamic Center of Davis are trying to deflect responsibility from themselves by issuing all kinds of mendacious and libelous statements against the entity that exposed them. The inciting messages in Imam Shahin’s prayer were absolutely in context; here is the sermon in full from the YouTube channel of the ICD. The viewer can use their own judgment. The message in the Imam’s prayer is clear and coherent, and MEMRI’s translation was absolutely accurate. It should be noted that Imam Shahin referred neither to “Israelis” nor to “Zionists,” but to “the Jews.” Imam Shahin also made similar statements in his July 14 Friday sermon, which was also posted on the ICD’s YouTube channel (view it here). The libelous accusations against MEMRI are untrue, inasmuch as they are irrelevant to Imam Shahin’s inciting prayer. Additionally, the messages in his July 21 prayer are in line with his messages in the prayer from his sermon the previous week, on July 14 (see below MEMRI transcripts of the July 21 and July 14 sermons). In contrast to the allegations by the ICD, MEMRI is a bipartisan, nonprofit organization that has been translating and analyzing the media of the Arab and Muslim world for nearly two decades (www.memri.org). One of our most important projects is our Tom Lantos Archives on Antisemitism, named after Congressman Tom Lantos, the only Holocaust survivor to serve in Congress; in this project, we present content and figures like Imam Shahin as well as voices who oppose this. Sadly, hundreds of examples of such statements by sheikhs and imams, in both the Middle East and the West, can be found on our website.

Keep in mind in Shahin’s July 14 sermon, in which he said, “The Al-Aqsa Mosque is besieged, and there are no prayers in it. Those wicked Jews are prohibiting prayer there, so how can one not pray to Allah at night, because he is busy with his food, his drink, his children, or his country, his circumstances, or things that happen to him? Isn’t there a single wise man among us?” came in the wake of a terror attack earlier in the day in which three Muslim terrorists smuggled weapons to the Temple Mount and murdered two Muslim policemen there. So a cold-blooded terror attack in a holy place is not an outrage to Muslims, but the effort to secure the area afterwards and make sure that it’s safe is?

What Took so Long?

Boorstein in her report acknowledges that she had received a statement from Shahin already on Wednesday, yet she held off reporting on the hate speech until Shahin offered his so-called apology. This another indication of how the reporting was designed not to expose the hate speech, but assist in the damage control.

The Washington Post recently adopted an ominous sounding motto “Democracy Dies in Darkness,” if its reporting on Shahin’s remarks is any indication, it apparently has adopted an approach that will allow anti-Semitism to flourish.

The Sacramento Bee also played down Hassin’s anti-Semitism.

Petra Marquardt-Bigham recently recalled the hate sermons issued from the Al Aqsa mosque, does their language sound substantially different from that of Shahin or Harmoush?

Influx of foreign minors: Jean-René Lecerf raises the alarm bell The president of the Department of the North is no longer able to cope with the influx of unaccompanied foreign minors. “The problem is colossal,” he says. We observe this phenomenon in the North and in other departments. ” This immigration has increased significantly in recent years. Essentially young people from sub-Saharan countries, from North Africa, 70% of whom are migrants from Guinea but also from Malians, Algerians and Moroccans. “A peaceful invasion. It is an economic and educational migration. “ According to the law, departmental councils must ensure the reception and care of foreign isolated minors (MIE) in France. A decree of June 24, 2016 gives a legal framework to the agreement of 2013 between the French Ministry of Justice and the Assembly of French Departments (ADF). More than 600 minors in care More and more foreign minors are arriving in the North. In 2011, the Department was responsible for 195 minors. “Today we have 930 young people,” says President Lecerf. In 2017, we saw an increase of 30%, or 1,200 people who arrived in the North. We will have 600 more unaccompanied minors, a budget of 36 million euros for 170 euros for the day in the home. To know the lodging, the cover and a small surveillance. At this rate, we will never be able to endure this effort. “

The urgency of the situation led to a recent meeting between President Lecerf, the Prefect and the judicial authorities for better border control. They also have the difficulty that some young migrants lie about their true age using false papers. And sometimes the jurisprudence obliges the Department to take charge of young adults. “This is a call for air,” insists Jean-René Lecerf. Our capacities are saturated. So I asked that the state take care of these young people from their majority. We are in the same boat. As early as the last parliamentary elections, Jean-René Lecerf intends to challenge the government on this issue."

Oakland Bakery Paints Giant Mural to Honor Palestinian Terrorist

It’ll make you throw up your flatbread.

By Trey sanchez, Truth revolt(thanks to Todd):

bakery in Oakland, California, owned by a Palestinian-Syrian, has a large painted mural dedicated to convicted Palestinian terrorist Rasmea Odeh near its front counter. Odeh killed two Israeli students in a 1969 food market bombing for which she only served 10 years of a life sentence in prison. She was released as part of a plea deal in exchange for a captured Israeli soldier. In 1995, Odeh moved to Chicago via Jordan but lied on her immigration papers, checking “no” for past convictions of crimes. She is scheduled to be deported to Jordan in August for the fraud, but not before being lionized by the bakery and just about everyone on the Left as a progressive icon.

Reem Assil, the owner of the Arab-infused Reem’s California, considers Odeh, an organizer of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine which carried out several other foiled bombings, as a mere political activist wrongly arrested and convicted by Israel. She also believes Odeh was sexually tortured into a confession by Israeli authorities. And because of that, Assil says Odeh deserves the giant portrait because she is an “emblem of resilience” and told a Berkeley-based food critic that Odeh is a modern day Malcolm X:

“[Odeh] embodies the resilience of Arab women fighting for justice in this country. She is an elder to a lot of us younger women who are activists and want to do right among our community.”

Assil, a former labor activist and community organizer, views her bakery as a place where activism and culture meet. The mural, she said, “pays our respect to people like [Odeh] who have had to endure.” As an added social justice bonus, Odeh has a painted pin on her Islamic head covering of 22-year-old Oakland resident Oscar Grant who was killed by police in 2009.

Others who heap praise on Odeh include Palestinian activist Linda Sarsour, who heralds Odeh regularly and was recently “honored” to share the stage with her at an anti-Israel event. Both women helped organize the Women’s March after President Trump’s inauguration and Odeh co-authored the manifesto for the militant feminist “Day Without a Woman” strike two months later.

Here is the bakery owner defending her pro-terrorism decoration:

Not everyone in Oakland is happy about the mural. Organized protests outside the bakery have been going on since it opened. Because most may be unaware of Odeh’s past, the protesters stand in front of the entrance holding pictures of Edward Joffe and Leon Kanner, the two Hebrew University students killed by the bomb Odeh planted in 1969. Some have even held vigils for the murdered Jews in front of the eatery.

But in kind, those protests and vigils have been targeted by anti-Israel activists who have physically attacked protesters, including the elderly, and destroyed the pictures of the murdered men. Below is footage from a recent protest, which are in danger of being shut down by Assil who is trying to complain of trespassing:

As Legal Insurrection’s Miriam Elman concluded, “The effort to stifle and silence Oakland’s vigils in honor of Rasmea Odeh’s victims is even more offensive and grievous than the fact that Reem’s California is decorated with a giant image of her face.”

Chief among these is the almost universally held idea that poverty causes terrorism. The United States has wasted uncounted (literally, because a great deal of it was in untraceable bags full of cash) billions of dollars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Egypt, and other countries in the wrongheaded assumption that Muslims turn to jihad because they lack economic opportunities and education. American officials built schools and hospitals, thinking that they were winning over the hearts and minds of the locals.

Fifteen years, thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars later, no significant number of hearts and minds have been won. This is partly because the premise is wrong. The New York Times reported in March that “not long after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001…Alan B. Krueger, the Princeton economist, tested the widespread assumption that poverty was a key factor in the making of a terrorist. Mr. Krueger’s analysis of economic figures, polls, and data on suicide bombers and hate groups found no link between economic distress and terrorism.”

CNS News noted in September 2013 that “according to a Rand Corporation report on counterterrorism, prepared for the Office of the Secretary of Defense in 2009, ‘Terrorists are not particularly impoverished, uneducated, or afflicted by mental disease. Demographically, their most important characteristic is normalcy (within their environment). Terrorist leaders actually tend to come from relatively privileged backgrounds.’ One of the authors of the RAND report, Darcy Noricks, also found that according to a number of academic studies, ‘Terrorists turn out to be more rather than less educated than the general population.’”

Yet the analysis that poverty causes terrorism has been applied and reapplied and reapplied again. The swamp is in dire need of draining, and in other ways as well. From 2011 on, it was official Obama administration policy to deny any connection between Islam and terrorism. This came as a result of an October 19, 2011 letter from Farhana Khera of Muslim Advocates to John Brennan, who was then the Assistant to the President on National Security for Homeland Security and Counter Terrorism, and later served in the Obama administration as head of the CIA. The letter was signed not just by Khera, but by the leaders of virtually all the significant Islamic groups in the United States: 57 Muslim, Arab, and South Asian organizations, many with ties to Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, including the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), the Muslim American Society (MAS), the Islamic Circle of North America (ICNA), Islamic Relief USA; and the Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC).

The letter denounced what it characterized as U.S. government agencies’ “use of biased, false and highly offensive training materials about Muslims and Islam.” Despite the factual accuracy of the material about which they were complaining, the Muslim groups demanded that the task force “purge all federal government training materials of biased materials”; “implement a mandatory re-training program for FBI agents, U.S. Army officers, and all federal, state and local law enforcement who have been subjected to biased training”; and more—to ensure that all that law enforcement officials would learn about Islam and jihad would be what the signatories wanted them to learn.

Numerous books and presentations that gave a perfectly accurate view of Islam and jihad were removed from coounterterror training. Today, even with Trump as President, this entrenched policy of the U.S. government remains, and ensures that all too many jihadists simply cannot be identified as risks, since the officials are bound as a matter of policy to ignore what in saner times would be taken as warning signs. Trump and Tillerson must reverse this. Trump has spoken often about the threat from “radical Islamic terrorism”; he must follow through and remove the prohibitions on allowing agents to study and understand the motivating ideology behind the jihad threat.

The swamp needs draining indeed. This news from the State Department, and the New York Times’ grief over it, are good signs that the U.S. is on its way back on dry land.

Noor, who is yet to give a statement on how Damond died, is said to feel remorse over the death of the 40-year-old life coach. Minneapolis Police Federation president Bob Kroll, who has been in regular contact with Noor, told News Corp that he alone had received about 10 messages on his voicemail threatening himself, Noor or the police in general. “Some have been very specific and others have been quite general death threats, not just to our office but to the 5th precinct (where Noor worked) and elsewhere,” he said. “In total there have been dozens of death threats They really aren’t helping anyone.” Mr Kroll said Noor feels “relatively sure that he is safe” where he is staying. Asked if that meant he had left Minneapolis, where the story is still front-page news, Mr Kroll replied, “I can’t comment on that. I don’t want to say anything that would jeopardise his safety.”…

At least 69 people died in a Boko Haram ambush of an oil exploration team in north-east Nigeria, as three men kidnapped by the jihadists made a video appeal. Experts said the attack — Boko Haram’s bloodiest this year — underscored the persistent threat it poses, despite government claims the group is a spent force. “So far the death toll stands at 69,” said an aid agency worker involved in the recovery of bodies after the attack in the Magumeri area of Borno state on Tuesday. The worker, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorised to speak to the media, said 19 soldiers, 33 civilian militia and 17 civilians were killed. “The last body was recovered on Friday in the bush in the Geidam district of neighbouring Yobe state, which is several kilometres from the scene of the ambush,” he said. “It shows the victim, who had gunshot wounds, died after trekking a long distance. There could be more such victims in the bush.” Another sourcve managed to gain enough resources, enough material, to plan ambushes targeted towards high value targets.”

This is the bloodiest attack this year by Boko Haram.

REPORT: Top FBI lawyer under investigation for leaking classified information

CIRCA (thanks to Right Scoop):

FBI General Counsel James A. Baker is purportedly under a Department of Justice criminal investigation for allegedly leaking classified national security information to the media, according to multiple government officials close to the probe who spoke with Circa on the condition of anonymity.

FBI spokeswoman Carol Cratty said the bureau would not comment on Baker and would not confirm or deny any investigation. Baker did not return comment when Circa attempted to reach him through the FBI.

This comes as Department of Justice Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he would soon be making an announcement regarding the progress of leak investigations. A DOJ official declined to comment on Circa’s inquiry into Baker but did say, the planned announcement by Sessions is part of the overall “stepped up efforts on leak investigations.”

Three sources, with knowledge of the apparent investigation, told Circa that Baker is the top suspect in an ongoing leak investigation, but Circa has not been able to confirm the details of what national security information or material was allegedly leaked.

A federal law enforcement official with knowledge of ongoing internal investigations in the bureau told Circa, “the bureau is scouring for leakers and there’s been a lot of investigations.”

The revelation comes as the Trump administration has ramped up efforts to contain leaks both within the White House and within its own national security apparatus.

Why not?

Because of a loophole in the law called the Garrity Warning.

This is such an outrageous case. But the fact this officer may skate ratchets it to a new level of outrage.

Here’s more, from the Daily Mail (thanks to Jihad Watch):

The U.S. police officer who shot dead Australian woman Justine Damond as she stood on a driveway outside her home may never face criminal charges. Rookie cop Mohamed Noor is maintaining his silence and continues to exercise his legal right not to be interviewed by investigators probing Ms Damond’s death. However, when the shooting becomes the subject of an internal police investigation, Noor will be compelled to provide statement or face the sack from the force. The only catch is, any statement he provides during the internal investigation cannot be used in a criminal case due to a legal technicality, the Star Tribune reports. The law is known as the Garrity Warning in Minnesota, and means that public employees under internal investigation are given the option to provide information or face disciplinary action. ‘Because you are being required to provide information under the threat of disciplinary action, the information you provide, and any evidence resulting from the information you provide, cannot and will not be used against you in any subsequent criminal proceeding,’ the warning reads. A number of unrelated felony criminal cases in America are reportedly relying on the same law to have their client’s cases thrown out, claiming prosecutors used internal interviews to build up their own cases.

Damond was shot and kiled by Noor on July 15.

She had called police around 11:30 p.m. because she had heard a woman’s screams. When police arrived, she approached the vehicle. And that’s when Noor shot her, the bullet flying right past his partner in the car to hit Damond in the stomach.

Neither officer had their body cameras on at the time of the shooting.

Wasserman Schultz planned to pay Muslim IT spy even while he lived in Pakistan,"['Pamela Geller', 'Mark Steiner', 'David Square', 'Mahou Shoujo', 'Michael Garfinkel', 'Drew The Infidel', 'Garry Pollack', 'Alleged Comment', 'Gr Arnold', 'ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Deplorable']","By Robert Spencer, July 30, 2017

“Imran Awan did admit to me that my phone is tapped and there are devices installed in my house” and “Imran Awan threatened that he is very powerful and if I ever call the police again, [he] will … kidnap my family members back in Pakistan,” his stepmother, Samina Gilani, claimed.

This man “could read all emails sent and received” by Wasserman Schultz “and see all files on the staff members’ computers.”

This is an immense scandal with multiple implications, and cries out for a full and thorough investigation. But there will almost certainly not be one: too many powerful people involved, with too much at stake. And that in itself demonstrates again why a full investigation is needed.

“Wasserman Schultz Seemingly Planned To Pay Suspect Even While He Lived In Pakistan,” by Luke Rosiak, Daily Caller, July 29, 2017:

Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz seemingly planned to pay cyber-probe suspect and IT aide Imran Awan even while he was living in Pakistan, if the FBI hadn’t stopped him from leaving the U.S. Monday. Public statements and congressional payroll records suggest she also appears to have known that his wife, a fellow IT staffer, left the country for good months ago — while she was also a criminal suspect.

In all, six months of actions reveal a decision to continue paying a man who seemingly could not have been providing services to her, and who a mountain of evidence suggests was a liability. The man long had access to all of Wasserman Schultz’s computer files, work emails and personal emails, and he was recently accused by a relative in court documents of wiretapping and extortion.

Records also raise questions about whether the Florida Democrat permitted Awan to continue to access computers after House-wide authorities banned him from the network Feb. 2. Not only did she keep him on staff after the ban, but she also did not have any other IT person to perform necessary work that presumably would have arisen during a months-long period, according to payroll records.

Wasserman Schultz employed Pakistani-born Awan and his wife Hina Alvi, and refused to fire either of them even after U.S. Capitol Police said in February 2017 that they were targets of the criminal investigation. She said police wouldn’t show her evidence against the couple and, without it, she assumed they might be victims of anti-Muslim profiling.

Awan booked a round-trip ticket to Pakistan in July and planned to depart Monday, July 24 with a return ticket in six months. He was arrested at Dulles Airport during his attempt to leave….

The office’s insistence that his termination was prompted by the Monday arrest — and not the House Sergeant at Arms banning him and his wife from touching congressional computers or his six months in Pakistan — suggests that had he boarded the flight without incident he would still be on payroll.

“Does that mean if he had boarded the flight as planned the office would have been paying him for six months while he was abroad?” TheDCNF investigative group asked Wasserman Schultz’s spokesman Thursday. “Why would it do that?” The spokesman did not respond.

Awan’s wife, Hina, left the country under similar circumstances March 5, after withdrawing the couple’s three kids from school without telling Virginia education officials, packing up all of her possessions, and hiding $12,000 in cash, according to an FBI affidavit. She allegedly had hundreds of thousands of dollars waiting in Pakistan for her — money the FBI says Awan had obtained partly through mortgage fraud and had wired overseas using a false explanation.

Two days later, on March 7, House records show Hina was cut from Wasserman Schultz’s payroll.

Though Hina bought a round trip ticket with a return in six months, the FBI said it “does not believe that Alvi has any intention to return to the United States.”…

Hina and Awan were both IT aides whose jobs required access to the network, but the House Sergeant-At-Arms banned them from accessing it beginning Feb. 2. Awan and Hina were her only IT staffers, and payroll records through the latest available period, March 31, indicate that no other IT staffer or vendor was added to the payroll after their ban.

A House source said Awan was seen in the House office building multiple times after the network ban. “Imran Awan is working in an “advisory” role for Wasserman Schultz, her spokesman said, “providing advice on technology issues.”

The spokesman wouldn’t say who did the office’s computer work after the ban, if not Awan.

As IT administrators, the suspects could read all emails sent and received by the lawmaker and see all files on the staff members’ computers, numerous House IT aides said. WikiLeaks shows that Awan also had the password to Wasserman Schultz’s iPad.

In public court documents filed in Fairfax, Va., Awan’s stepmother accused him of wiretapping and extortion. “Imran Awan did admit to me that my phone is tapped and there are devices installed in my house” and “Imran Awan threatened that he is very powerful and if I ever call the police again, [he] will … kidnap my family members back in Pakistan,” his stepmother, Samina Gilani, claimed in the documents (p. 21) filed April 14…."

Nearly seven million migrants are ‘waiting to cross into Europe’: Leaked report warns of new crisis but Brussels insists the situation is under control

Millions of asylum seekers are waiting to cross into Europe, leaked report says

Confidential report says there 2.5million waiting in war-torn North Africa

Surge has led to 1,200 deaths so far this year as gangs use ruthless tactics

Daily Mail, May 23, 2017:

More than six million asylum seekers are waiting to cross into Europe, a leaked intelligence report warns.

There has been a huge increase in the number of migrants hoping to reach EU countries, it says – contradicting claims from Brussels that the situation is under control.

The confidential report, leaked to German newspaper Bild, claims 6.6million migrants are waiting in countries around the Mediterranean sea to cross into Europe, including 2.5million in war-torn North Africa.

This year has already seen record numbers of African migrants making the perilous journey across the Mediterranean, with Italy the frontline of the crisis.

The surge has led to more than 1,200 deaths so far this year as smuggling gangs, largely operating in lawless Libya, resort to increasingly ruthless tactics. Charities have warned there could be even higher numbers making the crossing in the coming months.

The report, which is yet to be verified, warns the number waiting to cross into Europe has risen by 650,000 since the end of January alone – an increase of 12 per cent.

One million are living in Libya, it says, while around 3.3million of the total are currently in Turkey.

That figure has previously been disclosed by authorities. Of these, nearly 3 million are Syrians, including more than 1.3 million children, while the other 310,000 are mostly from Iraq and Afghanistan, according to UNICEF.

The number of those waiting in Turkey has remained relatively stable for 18 months but continues to put a strain on the country.

EU leaders have boasted that a controversial deal with Turkey which bolstered the country’s coastguard and saw sprawling migrant camps set up there has largely stemmed the flow of migrants making their way into Europe.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly plans to request similar deals with North African countries in a manifesto ahead of September’s election, according to Bild.

It will include plans for those who are rescued from drowning while attempting the crossing to be returned to the country from which they set out.

According to the report, another 1million are waiting in Egypt, 430,000 in Algeria, 160,000 in Tunisia, and 50,000 in Morocco. Others are waiting in transit countries along the route, with up to 720,000 in Jordan.

Mrs Merkel’s open-door migration policy led to a wave of criticism in 2015. While she has recently enjoyed success in the polls, another migrant surge could prove politically challenging.

Last year huge numbers of asylum seekers tried to reach Italy, with many losing their lives as boats sank along the way. This year the number attempting the crossing has already surged by 42 per cent – 44,222 compared to 31,205.

There have been disturbing claims that the mafia in Sicily – where many migrants arrive – are siphoning huge sums of public money allocated to address the issue."

No sane society should allow this. The British authorities send Muslims to prison for jihad activity, and they recruit ten more jihadis in prison. This is not punishment, it’s reinforcement.

“Prisoner ‘slashed throats of guard and inmate after shouting “this is for Allah” then attacked second officer days later,'” by Tom Pettifor, Mirror, July 25, 2017:

A prisoner allegedly shouted “this is for Allah” before slashing the throat of a jail guard and an inmate – then went on to attack a second prison officer at another jail two days later.

The suspected Islamic extremist is alleged to have used the same phrase uttered by the London Bridge attackers when they murdered seven people with knives and a van.

It comes after Prime Minister, Theresa May, warned in the aftermath of the London atrocity last month of violent extremists carrying out copycat attacks “often using the crudest means”.

The violent incident left the prison officer and a fellow lag needing hospital treatment after they were both attacked with a blade at HMP Weyland in Norfolk on Friday afternoon.

Prison bosses are probing how the thug was able to attack a second officer two days later on Sunday after being moved to another jail.

Detectives from Norfolk police are investigating both incidents but so far no arrests have been made.

An official source said the suspect was not serving a sentence for a terror related offence, raising the prospect he had been radicalised in jail.

Questions have been raised over why the alleged attacker was not held in a high risk unit for people who have been radicalised.

A second source confirmed that witnesses say the attacker shouted: “This is for Allah” during the first attack.

The suspect was transferred to HMP Lincoln where he slashed the second prison officer on Sunday, this time with a sharpened piece of masonry, it is claimed, leaving the officer with minor injuries.

One source said of the suspect: “He was voicing extreme views. He said ‘only white people should die’ and ‘This is for Allah’ as he did it.

“He should have gone to a high risk unit for people who have been radicalised. Especially after the first incident at HMP Wayland – he should not have just been transferred to HMP Lincoln.”…"

The right represents those of us who favor individual freedom and capitalism — and the left are those who want government controls and socialism.

Political violence became an essential and successful means of leftist warfare in the 60’s, the decade of destruction. The success of the violent “student rebellion” in 1964 and the so-called Free Speech Movement has set the table for the left’s warmongering and treason. It was clear from the outset that the “student revolution” violently ushered in at Berkeley in the mid-sixties would come to this. The left is evil, and they mean to destroy our way of life, our freedom and us. It took decades to norm their anti-Americanism, their hatred of freedom and individual rights, but they have reached their tipping point. And the long beaten and battered among us have had it.

Ayn Rand explained why the left is seeking nothing less than the breakdown of American society:

The attempt to solve social problems by means of physical force is what a civilized society is established to prevent. The advocates of mass civil disobedience admit that their purpose is intimidation. A society that tolerates intimidation as a means of settling disputes—the physical intimidation of some men or groups by others—loses its moral right to exist as a social system, and its collapse does not take long to follow. Politically, mass civil disobedience is appropriate only as a prelude to civil war—as the declaration of a total break with a country’s political institutions.

The left is targeting the most powerful office in the world — the Presidency. But, as the shooting of Rep. Steve Scalise and others at the Congressional baseball practice shows, they’re targeting everyone on the Right. There will be more of this.

President Trump was elected by Americans who oppose the left-wing coup and are fed up with living under the left’s oppressive boot. Trump is our proxy. We fought back the non-violent way — through the ballot box. From the moment he was elected, the left refused to accept the will of the people.

This Russian witchhunt is, according to the pundit David P. Goldman (columnist “Spengler”), an “illegal and and unconstitutional mutiny.” Spengler also noted that “one of the Republican Party’s most distinguished statesmen,” whom he did not name, “recently told a closed gathering that a ‘cold coup’ is underway against the president.”

And that is just one of many coups — legal, cultural, political, violent. David P. Goldman (“Spengler”) explains:

The Trump-Russia collusion story is nonsense, as its disseminators know better than anyone else. The object of the exercise is not to support the innuendo, but to launch an investigation which can provoke the White House into responses that might be construed as illegal. The intelligence leaks involved in framing the story alone are probably sufficient grounds to put several dozen senior officials in federal prison for double-digit terms. That consideration gauges the scale of the problem: the mutineers have committed multiple felonies, and their downside should the mutiny go wrong is not ignominious retirement but hard time at Leavenworth. For the moment, the mutineers have the momentum. The Trump administration continues to run on a skeleton staff, with the vast majority of key positions still unoccupied. If my surmise is correct, it was unable to persuade the director of the FBI, the nation’s chief watchdog, to undertake vigorous countermeasures against the mutiny, for example, a comprehensive screening of electronic communications by the reporters who received leaks of classified materials.

The right has played nice for much too long. Last Friday night, Laura Loomer took to the stage in Central Park and interrupted the Broadway production of Julius Caesar, a play by William Shakespeare that had been politically altered to feature the assassination of U.S. President Donald Trump.

The Rebel reported: “At the moment when Trump was being gleefully murdered — an applause moment for America’s left-wing entertainment elites — Laura jumped on stage and condemned the play for normalizing political violence. Laura was arrested and held by police. The theatre company, by contrast, continues to produce their snuff show, glamorizing and normalizing violent terrorism in America.”

What’s the difference between Loomer taking to the stage and the actors hijacking the Hamilton stage to denigrate the Vice President of the United States? The audience didn’t come for that, either.

Laura was arrested for “trespassing,” but leftwing thugs and goons attack those on the right at demos in support of Trump and Israel. Freedom lovers are beaten at rallies against jihad and sharia by left-wing fascists who mockingly call themselves antifa (anti-fascists).

The deck is stacked against us. We must get off the defense.

Product Description

How can we defend America against Islamic supremacist encroachment?

In ""Stop the Islamization of America,"" renowned activist Pamela Geller provides the answer, offering proven, practical guidance on how freedom lovers can stop jihadist initiatives in local communities.

Today Islamic supremacists are demanding more accommodation of Islamic principles and practices than ever, and daily growing more aggressive in eroding our freedoms – with politically correct public officials only too happy to oblige them. Speaking from the fruit of her experience as the national leader of the fight against the Ground Zero mega-mosque and numerous other initiatives, Geller’s guidebook provides a much-needed wake-up call about a sinister agenda that could do nothing less than destroy the United States – with unique instructions about how we can, and must, fight back now to defend our nation and civilization.

Packed with current information drawn from Geller's front-line experience in the struggle against Islamist organizations and creeping Shariah in the United States, ""Stop the Islamization of America"" is an indispensable guidebook for everyone committed to defending American liberty.

Here is just a small sampling of what you'll find in this book:

Startling new information about the full extent of Muslim Brotherhood infiltration in the Department of Justice, and its brazen pro-Muslim activities, including its “Monthly Outreach Meetings” with Muslim and Arab groups at the Civil Rights Division – and the 14,000 documents the DOJ won't release that reveal the full, shocking extent of this cooperation.

A primer for protest against Islamic supremacist mosques and other initiatives in your local area.

A primer for how freedom fighters can deal with an adversarial media.

The shocking details of the travesty that is the 9/11 victims memorial, which is planning to put the unidentified remains of 9/11 victims seven stories underground inside a museum that charges admission – and which will include lavish profiles (above ground, of course) of the 9/11 hijackers.

The Sheepshead Bay mosque initiative and other mega-mosque initiatives nationwide, the sinister forces behind them and their insidious agenda.

Never-before-released details of the Islamic honor murders of the Texas teenagers Amina and Sarah Said.

The American Bar Association’s cover-up of its work to resist anti-Shariah initiatives.

The Islamic schools that receive public money.

The truth behind Virginia’s failing to mail military ballots in time for them to be counted in the election of 2008.

Links between the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and the Islamic Society of North America, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee and the Muslim Students Association.

AND MUCH MORE

Praise for ""Stop the Islamization of America"":

""The First Amendment's free-speech guarantee is central to America's character and our fundamental liberties.

“Mubarek Ali, leader of child sex gang that abused girls in Telford, to be freed 17 years early,” by Ludovica Iaccino, International Business Times, July 30, 2017:

The convicted leader of a child sex gang that operated in England will be released from prison 17 years earlier, according to reports.

Mubarek Ali, one of a number of member who helmed of the Telford-based gang, was sentenced to 22 years in jail for crimes including assaulting girls as young as 13.

However, just five years into his sentence, he has been told he could walk free as early as November.

Ali, 34, was captured as part of a police investigation called Operation Chalice in 2013. During the trial at the Worcester Crown Court, four girls aged between 13 and 16 gave evidence of the abuse they had been subjected to by the gang member between 2007 and 2009.

At the time, Deborah Gould, prosecuting, warned the jury that as the trial unfolded they would be introduced to a world “that I expect few of you were aware of”.

It is believed most of the girls involved thought they were “loved and in love” with the men at the time, the prosecution explained.

Telford MP Lucy Allan criticised the decision to free him, arguing he would be allowed to go back into the community where his victims continue to live.

In an open letter sent to the paper, Allan said the victims, who had not been informed of Ali’s early release, are “living in fear”.

“Victims and members of the public would have expected a 22-year sentence to mean that the community could have time to heal and victims would be able to get on with their lives,” she said.

“What we see in this case is that the one of the main perpetrators is being released into the community only five years after the trial. This is clearly of enormous concern to victims in this case, especially those who gave evidence in court.

“What is unacceptable that in this case there was no attempt by the authorities to reach out these young women and prepare them for this wholly unexpected event,” Allan continued…."

MINNEAPOLIS Officer Mohamed Noor has received dozens of death threats as public outrage over the shooting of Australian Justine Damond explodes. Noor, who is yet to give a statement on how Damond died, is said to feel remorse over the death of the 40-year-old life coach. Minneapolis Police Federation president Bob Kroll, who has been in regular contact with Noor, told News Corp that he alone had received about 10 messages on his voicemail threatening himself, Noor or the police in general. “Some have been very specific and others have been quite general death threats, not just to our office but to the 5th precinct (where Noor worked) and elsewhere,” he said. “In total there have been dozens of death threats They really aren’t helping anyone.” Mr Kroll said Noor feels “relatively sure that he is safe” where he is staying. Asked if that meant he had left Minneapolis, where the story is still front-page news, Mr Kroll replied, “I can’t comment on that. I don’t want to say anything that would jeopardise his safety.”…

At least 69 people died in a Boko Haram ambush of an oil exploration team in north-east Nigeria, as three men kidnapped by the jihadists made a video appeal. Experts said the attack — Boko Haram’s bloodiest this year — underscored the persistent threat it poses, despite government claims the group is a spent force. “So far the death toll stands at 69,” said an aid agency worker involved in the recovery of bodies after the attack in the Magumeri area of Borno state on Tuesday. The worker, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorised to speak to the media, said 19 soldiers, 33 civilian militia and 17 civilians were killed. “The last body was recovered on Friday in the bush in the Geidam district of neighbouring Yobe state, which is several kilometres from the scene of the ambush,” he said. “It shows the victim, who had gunshot wounds, died after trekking a long distance. There could be more such victims in the bush.” Another sourcve managed to gain enough resources, enough material, to plan ambushes targeted towards high value targets.”

This is the bloodiest attack this year by Boko Haram.

The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children reported its members now provide three times the amount of counseling for these young girls as they did just five years ago.

If a child or young person you know is worried about forced marriage, remind them that #Childline is always here on 0800 1111 or online. pic.twitter.com/NDfF6B94Jn

And the victims are as young as 13.

Breitbart has more:

Some of the victims are as young as 13 and they are frequently threatened with violence and emotional blackmail, pressuring them to marry older men they may have never met.

Childline, the 24-hour counselling hotline for children provided by the NSPCC, has experienced more children than ever are calling with fears over forced marriage. The charity said it delivered 12 per cent more counselling sessions in 2016/17 than in 2015/16.

Forced marriage can carry a prison sentence of up to seven years in the UK, but as of December 31, 2016, figures suggest there has been just one conviction in Britain.

The charity said some families use the long school summer holidays to pull children out of Britain and marry them off abroad to strangers.

The full scale of the abuse may be unknown, however, as some girls do not speak out because they are “worried about family honour and being isolated by their communities” and fear their “relatives would be punished if they sought help.”

One 18-year-old girl who contacted Childline said: “My parents are talking about taking me back to my home country to get married, but I don’t want to. They get violent when I don’t do what they want.

“I want to leave home but they’d never agree to it. I just want to live a normal teenage life, but they won’t let me.”

NSPCC Chief Executive Peter Wanless commented: “Forcing a child to marry shows a complete lack of regard for their feelings, thoughts or ambitions. We must be clear that, regardless of cultural expectations, this is a crime and an abuse of human rights.”

Childline founder and president Dame Esther Rantzen added: “Young people can feel helpless because sometimes those near to them aren’t interested in their happiness or welfare.

“It’s desperately important that those are frightened or feel that they have no one to turn to get in touch with Childline.”

There has been a similar failure to prosecute perpetrators of female genital mutilation (FGM) – another crime largely associated with migrant communities.

Despite the practice being illegal in the UK for 31 years, and more than 5,000 new cases recorded in England last year, not a single successful prosecution has been made."

White House Backs House Bill To Crack Down On Asylum Fraud

Will Racke, Daily Caller, July 28, 2017L

The White House signaled Thursday that it will support a House Republican proposal to overhaul the U.S. asylum system, saying that stricter rules are needed to prevent fraud and abuse in the the asylum claims process.

The Asylum Reform and Border Protection Act, sponsored by Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana, would raise the standard for proving a “credible fear” of persecution in an asylum applicant’s home country and limit when immigration authorities can use parole to admit immigrants into the U.S.

The White House sees the bill, which passed the House Judiciary Committee in a party line vote Wednesday, as a bulwark against potential transnational gang recruits entering the U.S. under the guise of asylum, according to a senior administration official.

“The asylum process right now is extremely prone to fraud and the amount of fraud found on those applications is enormous,” the official told reporters Thursday. “People can game the system by filing applications and then just disappearing [into the U.S.].”

While immigration hawks have largely focused their attention on illegal immigration and, to a lesser extent, the number of legal immigrants admitted every year, the asylum process has also come under fire from critics who say it is too easily abused. Andrew Arthur, a former immigration judge and currently a fellow at the conservative Center for Immigration Studies, argues that the standards for proving a credible fear are too low.

“In the credible fear process, however, the alien is not screened before entering the United States, and there are significant weaknesses and vulnerabilities in verifying the alien’s identity and screening his or her claim for fraud after the alien enters this country,” Arthur wrote in an April report.

The main vulnerability in the asylum system is that that asylum officers often have to rely solely on an applicant’s testimony, which can be nearly impossible to corroborate, Arthur says. Compounding that weakness, many asylum applicants are then released while they await a determination from an immigration judge, with no way track those who fail to return for court hearings.

“Aliens found to have credible fear are often released from custody before their asylum claims are heard in immigration court,” Arthur wrote. “This is significant from a fraud standpoint because … a finding of credible fear can be made without the alien presenting any corroborating evidence, or even identity documents.”

Johnson’s bill seeks to raise the evidentiary standards for proving credible fear by requiring an applicant’s statements to be “more probable than not true.” That subtle change would make it easier for immigration judges to suss out inconsistencies between testimony and other evidence of persecution. The proposal would also tighten the rules governing the use of immigration parole, an authority the Obama administration used to admit thousands of Central American migrants from 2014 to 2016.

The asylum bill could become an afterthought given the slate of contentious immigration legislation scheduled to be taken up by Congress in the coming legislative session, including two enforcement bills: Kate’s Law and the Davis Oliver Act. However, the White House says it will push for asylum reform along with the higher-profile measures.

“We are extremely hopeful that Congress will reform our asylum procedures to end asylum abuse, asylum fraud and the gaming of the system so it can be used as properly intended,” the administration official said. “This will also be an important to tool to preventing gang infiltration of this country.”

Key lawmakers are threatening to cancel the authorization of sensitive U.S. spy operations until congressional leaders investigate efforts by former top Obama administration officials to leak highly classified national security information in what many believe was a targeted campaign to undermine the Trump administration, according to senior congressional sources familiar with the situation.

Key Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee are pressuring Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R., Va.) to investigate former senior Obama administration officials believed to be responsible for these anti-Trump leaks, including former United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power, National Security Adviser Susan Rice, and National Security Council official Ben Rhodes, according to sources who spoke to the Washington Free Beacon about mounting frustration over Congress’s failure to adequately investigate these leaks.

Lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee are prepared to halt key spy operations related to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, until Congress performs a full investigation into how damaging classified surveillance information targeting the Trump campaign and administration officials was leaked to the press.

The House Intelligence Committee is engaged in a separate but related probe into efforts by Obama officials to “unmask,” or formally identify individuals named in classified intelligence community reports related to Trump and his presidential transition team. That investigation is currently focussed on Power, Rice, and former CIA Director John Brennan.

Sources in the Trump administration and Congress believe the classified intelligence information was “weaponized” and later lea ked to the press in order to handicap the Trump administration’s credibility and national security priorities.

Still, senior Republican members of Congress do not feel that enough is being done to hold those responsible for the leaks accountable.

By threatening to withhold the reauthorization of section 702 of the FISA Act—which permits the U.S. intelligence community to intercept communications outside of America—lawmakers believe they can force a thorough investigation into these Obama aides, who are suspected of exploiting FISA laws to gather and later leak sensitive intelligence damaging to Trump allies.

Congress is “not going to reauthorize a program if no one is held accountable for breaking the law,” said one senior congressional source familiar with the situation. “No one is being held accountable and Congress has done no oversight.”

Goodlatte is said to have initially been “really taken aback” by the stiff opposition to reauthorizing section 702, but is now making moves to examine the former administration’s role in classified leaks and potential opportunities to question these officials.

Republican members on the committee are said to be “all united” in their desire to investigate former Obama officials such as Rhodes, Rice, and Power, sources said.

These lawmakers “want answers on these Obama officials in order to continue [spy] authorizations they may have abused,” one congressional source said. “The members in the conference and these committees have reached a boiling point.”

Senior Trump administration officials, as well as those in Congress, have named former Obama administration officials such as Rice and Rhodes as key suspects in the dissemination of classified national security information."

How can this be?

Democratic senators, meanwhile, are holding up the confirmation of Mark Green, Trump’s choice to lead up the U.S. Agency for International Development — a move that keeps in place Barack Obama-era policies that shunned Iraq’s Christian populations from receiving crucial U.S. dollars.

The Washington Free Beacon has more (h/t Jihad Watch):

The State Department’s top lawyers are systematically removing the word “genocide” to describe the Islamic State’s mass slaughter of Christians, Yazidis, and other ethnic minorities in Iraq and Syria from speeches before they are delivered and other official documents, according to human rights activists and attorneys familiar with the policies. … Richard Visek, who was appointed by President Obama as head the State Department’s Office of Legal Adviser in October 2016, is behind the decision to remove the word “genocide” from official documents, according to Nina Shea, an international human rights lawyer who directs the Hudson Institute’s Center for Religious Freedom. “I don’t think for a minute it’s a bureaucratic decision—it’s ideological,” said Shea, who also spent 12 years as a commissioner on the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, or CIRF, from 1999 to 2012. A State Department spokesman on Monday said he would look into the matter and respond. The latest moves from the State Department’s Office of the Legal Adviser appear aimed at rolling back then-Secretary of State John Kerry’s March 2016 genocide determination. Kerry’s much-anticipated genocide designation came after months of equivocation and detailed documentation by interested parties that the Islamic State is responsible for genocide against Yazidis, Christians, and Shia Muslims. It was one of the few times in history that the United States designated ongoing mass murders against ethnic or religious minorities as meeting the legal definition of genocide laid out in a 1948 treaty. That agreement requires signatories, including the United States, to take steps to “prevent and punish” genocide. A bipartisan group of Capitol Hill lawmakers and activists, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Rep. Robert Aderholt (R., Ala.) were hoping the designation would help direct millions of dollars in U.S. relief funds to Christian, Yazidi, and other persecuted religious minority communities. ISIS murders and kidnappings have decimated the Christian population in Iraq, which numbered between 800,000 and 1.4 million in 2002, reducing it to fewer than 250,000 now. Without action, activists and charities say, Christians could disappear completely from Iraq in the near future. After meeting with Pope Francis in May, President Trump vowed to do everything in his power to defend and protect the “historic Christian communities of the Middle East.” Activists and Catholic leaders are now calling on Trump to turn the rhetoric into action on the ground and help get U.S. aid to these persecuted communities trying to rebuild their homes and their lives in Iraq. These advocates want the State Department, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the United Nations to allow church groups and other religious-affiliated relief organizations to receive government aid, a practice prohibited during the Obama administration. In early May, Congress allocated more than $1.3 billion in funds for refugee assistance and included specific language to try to ensure that at least some of the money is used to assist persecuted religious minorities, including Christians, Yazidis, and Shia Muslims—all groups the State Department deemed victims of genocide in 2016. Nevertheless, only $10 million is specifically earmarked for Christians, Yazidis, and other religious minorities. The Trump administration has until the end of September, when the stop-gap funding bill runs out, to ensure it distributes the funds in the most effective way. “There is congressional legislation … that calls for the U.S. government to stop excluding the genocide-targeted minorities in Iraq,” Shea said. “This has been a pervasive problem that this aid has not been getting to them.”

In June, several Republican senators sent a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to urge him to distribute dollars to “vulnerable and persecuted religious minorities.” But State’s response didn’t specify whether Christian charities would be able to take advantage of the tax aid to help out Christians, Yazidis and other religious minorities facing Islamic-tied persecution.

Rand Paul (R-KY) said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” that he believes President Donald Trump has the ability to pardon himself. Host Jake Tapper asked Paul if he believes Trump has the power to do so and Paul replied, “I think in all likelihood he does. I think that some of this hasn’t been adjudicated.” Trump himself believes he has the “complete power” to pardon, however, he tweeted out Saturday that he has nothing to pardon himself from.

However, as Paul stressed out during his interview on CNN, “at this point it is irrelevant whether or not President Trump is accused of this so-called crime – whatever his accusers conjure up, it won’t work. Donald Trump is President of the United States, and as such, has the power to pardon any and all persons at his own discretion. It might sound unfair to some, but it’s one of the perks of the job. That’s just how the Constitution works.”

When Tapper persisted in pushing Paul to comment more on the allegations that President Trump cheated during his presidential campaign as well as the election, the senator from Kentucky argued that he “already commented on the issue” and that there was “nothing more left to say.” “It’s just one of those things where it’s become useless to talk about any of it, because it’s in the past. It’s already happened and nothing we do now can change the consequences,” he said.

“Surely you’re not saying that Donald Trump can’t suffer consequences for cheating his way into the presidency?” Tapper insisted. Paul replied, “No, of course not, but you have to look at it like this: we don’t really care if Donald Trump cheated his way into the presidency or not; for that matter, we don’t even care if he’s found guilty or not. The fact to the matter is, like I said – the man possesses the legal power to pardon anyone he chooses in any given situation, and that includes himself. He’d be a fool not to use that option if the circumstances call for it.”

Paul also added, “We can’t allow ourselves to blame Donald Trump of anything we put him in power to do. It doesn’t work like that. There’s a reason our Constitution predicts a four-year term for every head of state. That time is given to every president to do his part for his country and, during that time, he should be left alone to do his work. What kind of a nation would be we if we were to drive out every single president after six months or something just because we weren’t sure of his motives? Like I said, it doesn’t work like that.”

“My point is – we shouldn’t care how Donald Trump won the presidency. It’s kind of like with rich people: you should never ask them how they came by their first million; other than that, you can ask them anything. What’s important now is focusing on the work that lies ahead for this country. As far as its president is concerned, he’s a smart man, he’ll solve any problems we face in the future. And if he’s found guilty – well, he’ll solve that problem too, let’s put it like that,” Paul concluded."

Long gone are the days where people were only able to look at things as outsiders, when the only option was to watch a story or observe catalogue pictures designed by someone else.

Now that the furniture giant IKEA has jumped on the VR bandwagon, more businesses could soon be following suit.

IKEA is famous for its catalogues in which every room of the house is shown in a range of different designs, and its huge warehouses that allow customers to explore and see how things look for themselves before buying. This form of display helps home owners visualize how items will look in their own homes, and the method has helped IKEA become one of the biggest furniture outlets in the world. It is, in fact, number 41 in the Forbes list of the World’s Most Valuable Brands with a value of $13.5 billion as of May 2017. But now that there is virtual reality available, why should customers have to tire themselves out by walking around the sprawling Swedish store? The top dogs at IKEA have realised that this is an area that needs to be addressed, and have created a pilot VR app which allows customers to explore a virtual kitchen. The virtual shopper can then change the colour of certain surfaces and furniture, add products and remove them, and explore what their ideal kitchen looks like in practice.



However, IKEA is somewhat behind the times when it comes to offering a more immersive online experience, as other industries such as the online casino sector have been providing this for their customers for a while now. While online casino software providers are still scrambling to create games for VR, some sites are offering an experience which is just like Las Vegas thanks to the live links available to real tables and games. Instead of having to visit the famous strip or even enter a local casino, players can now interact with real croupiers via webcam, making use of tech such as OCR and 4G as they stake on classic games such as roulette and blackjack.

Something else which is getting the immersive and interactive treatment is storytelling. Some children’s books over the years have given readers the chance to choose the way the story develops, but according to the Guardian this is now an option for TV series and films geared towards adults. One example of this is Her Story, which is described as a cross between Luthor and Jonathan Creek. Viewers watch the film in a non-linear fashion, as they choose to follow up leads and solve a crime. Games such as Until Dawn have also experimented with this, and it could be an exciting new way to consume media if more writers follow suit.

The rise of these immersive online experiences and the way they are changing important sectors like entertainment for the better, is one of the main reasons why VR is predicted to be a major platform in the years to come. In a few years when the headsets become more affordable, nearly everything could incorporate some aspects of the new technology."

Sources tell CNN that Trump’s rebuke of Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia probe “is causing deep alarm inside the West Wing, leading some to worry that their loyalty to Trump might not be reciprocated from the man in the Oval Office.” “It’s chilling,” one White House official told CNN. Another White House official said that Trump’s attack was particularly jarring because Sessions has been one of the president’s most loyal cabinet members. “No one was more loyal than Sessions,” the official emphasized. “No one.”

Commenting on his attack on Jeff Sessions, President Trump told portal KnowMyRepublican.com that he did “what had to be done” and that nobody should be surprised by his words, because “I want the people of America to know that the age of political correctness is gone and that, from now on, we’re going to call things by their true name regardless of who gets offended by it.” “That’s how the president of this country, of any country for that matter, is supposed to deal with traitors,” he said. “Because they don’t deserve anything better than that. To betray my trust is one thing, that’s of secondary importance. But, to betray this country and its people, that’s the part I can’t forgive. Had I known this would happen, I never would have offered him the job.”

He continued, “Jeff Sessions was the man who had my utmost confidence and trust. You don’t just go out and recuse yourself from something like this without, at the very least, giving me a warning before you go through with it. No, such a thing doesn’t happen spontaneously; I refuse to believe that the Jeff Sessions I once knew would do something like this, even unintentionally. He must have been brainwashed; what’s more, the man was obviously planted by Obama to destroy me. That’s the only reasonable explanation I can think of to account for his actions. That, and the other one is that he’s suddenly developed Alzheimer’s or dementia. But, seeing how he’s still sharp-minded, I’d say the former makes a lot more sense.”

“It must have been fairly easy to get to him, too. He gets around and knows a lot of people, and Obama’s got eyes and ears everywhere. But, the thing I’m struggling to figure out is, why now? He must have had countless other opportunities to act, things he could have done to cause much more damage to me and this country. Then again, if he could have Hillary Clinton running for president after him in spite of everything she’s done, having his CIA guys brainwash Jeff Sessions must have been like a walk in the park. You know, I have to note, one never truly gets used to how the Democrats operate and how far they’re willing to go sometimes. They’re almost like the Nazis – they have guys everywhere and know everything and they don’t care what it is they do and who they ruin as long as they get what they want. The difference is, the Nazis loved Germany and did everything for its sake – I think we’re all seeing that’s not the case with Barack Obama and the Democrats,” Trump concluded."

During a speech on the Senate floor Tuesday, McConnell said that it was sad that Democrats were celebrating the failure of the Republican Party’s bill. Neither McConnell nor President Trump ever reached out to Democrats on the bill and Democrats refused to deal on a bill that would “repeal and replace Obamacare.” Instead, they have said they prefer to “fix Obamacare.” “These are not just numbers on a page, these are real people,” McConnell said. Recent polling reveals the majority of Americans want to keep Obamacare.

After his speech at the Senate, McConnell told portal KnowMyRepublican.com that he was “truly disappointed” by the fact that his fellow Americans, regardless of the fact that some of them “only differ” in political views, still failed to realize that Trumpcare is “a better health care system than Obamacare will ever be.” “I am sad and also a bit hurt that I was standing in a room where nearly half of the people shot down a historic opportunity to make this country a better place for all citizens, and especially poor people,” McConnell said. “The only thing that separates us in there is our political views and that’s it. Take that away and you have a room full of Americans who are supposed to be on the same page when it comes to what needs to be done in this country. Apparently, I was wrong.”

He continued, “The defeat of Trumpcare demonstrated – in my eyes, at least – that only Republicans in this country, and more importantly, in the Senate, believe in poor people’s right to health. That’s the message I got in there just now. Because, at this point, it’s preposterous to even consider any Democrat will ever be open to the idea of Trumpcare replacing former President Obama’s health care system. By definition, that means that Republicans are the only ones who are working hard to give poor people free health care. President Trump is faced with numerous problems right now, the fake news lobby, the media’s persecution, the Russia investigation, he’s got a lot on his plate right now. And still he found the time to roll up his sleeves and come up with something for those of who have nothing.”

“All Democrats ever do is talk. They talk about liberalism, they talk about equality, they talk about LGBTQ rights, they talk about freedom of choice and what not, and yet, at the same time, they deny the freedom of free health care for the poorest citizens of this country. Because, that’s what they proved when they shot down Trumpcare. They’re all talk and no show. However, it’s the Republicans’ fault that’s the case, right? Somehow, they will found a way to blame it all on traditionalism and traditional values. Well, let me tell you something: Democrats just deprived millions of poor Americans free health care. That’s the same as rounding them up and stuffing them into gas chambers for execution like the Nazis used to do. It’s the same thing, only the Nazis made quick work of it. The Democrats made sure poor people’s deaths will be slow and agonizing,” McConnell concluded."

Speaking with “Fox News Sunday” host Chris Wallace and Obamacare architect Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, Hume called coverage of those with pre-existing conditions not a “triumph,” but problematic, like insuring a driver who has a car wreck in their past. “The triumph of Obamacare is this coverage for pre-existing conditions, which basically defeats the whole idea of insurance,” Hume suggested. “Which is, for example, in the automobile insurance market, if you could wait until you had a wreck and then buy insurance and have the repairs covered, that’s comparable to what we’re doing here.”

He continued, “What people tend to miss when it comes to this whole story about the wrongful glorification of Obamacare is the fact that it hurts the country in more ways than one. I’m not going to sit here and claim that it’s all bad and that it doesn’t have any upsides; of course it does, it helps those that can’t help themselves and that’s all fine and dandy from a spiritual point of view, so to speak. However, we don’t live in the spiritual world. We’re comprised of living, breathing cells that need oxygen and food and our existence here has a lot more to do with monetary values than spiritual ones, whether we like it or not. And if we have a health care system in place, which we do, that’s designed to fix one problem and it ends up creating ten times more problems than it repairs, then it has to go, period.”

“But even more than that, the thing that bothers me is the philosophy behind Obamacare, which is even more devastating than the damage it’s doing to the federal budget,” Hume continued. “Obamacare was designed to help the poorest and sickest citizens out there. However, as noble as that sounds, the consequence of such logic is the fact that it neglects the core ethic values that were embedded in the Constitution and that comprise the basic philosophy of this country: spend your life working hard, playing hard and not burdening others with your problems. Make yourself capable of anything and all shall be given to you. That means that every American’s basic responsibility is to take care of themselves first, which is to say, make sure they don’t get sick and fall into the care of others. If that happens, you’ve pretty much lost the right to call yourself an American, as cruel as that sounds.”

“Therefore, giving free health insurance to sick people and those with pre-existing conditions pretty much defeats the core ethic principle of this great country. If you want to be one of us, you have to carry your own weight and take care of yourself. You do that by being careful about what you eat, how you spend your time and how you conduct yourself every single minute of every single day. If you’re at a point where you’re both poor and you get sick, it’s your own fault. Nobody made you sick out of nowhere. You’re the only person responsible, you did that to yourself by not taking care of your health. And if you aren’t willing to take the time and effort to pay attention to the choices you make every single day of your life, why should the government? If you don’t value your health, why should other people? It’s never right to take food from other people’s mouths in order to feed yourself. Passively forcing others to clean up your mess and pay for your hospital bills through higher taxes is not compassion, it’s silent robbery,” Hume concluded."

Just two weeks prior to the release of emails documenting Trump, Jr.s’ meeting with Kremlin-linked attorney Nataliya Veselnitskaya, Trump’s reelection campaign paid $50,000 to the law offices of Alan Futerfas, The Daily Beast reports. “Trump Jr. does not yet face any official allegations of legal wrongdoing, but he and the White House have scrambled to contain the political fallout from the controversy,” The Beast explained. “It was not immediately clear whether the campaign expenditure was remuneration for Futerfas’s representation of Trump’s son on Russia-related or other matters. But the payment sticks out on a presidential campaign’s expenditure list: Futerfas’s expertise is in white collar criminal defense, not political and election law.”

Meanwhile, Trump Jr. addressed the controversy, arguing that he “never meant to hide such information from the public,” but also that “the public has to understand that these sort of things are subject to various protocols set in place for the safety of the family.” “Believe me when I say that there are good times to be a Trump, but there are also some very, very bad times to be a member of this family. This just happens to be one of the latter. However, I’d like to add that there has never before been a case in American history where such a powerful family made it into the White House as a whole. Therefore, you can’t expect all of us to act differently all of a sudden just because one of us managed to get a hold of the presidency. The rest of us still have very important jobs to do, and doing business requires a lot of money nowadays.”

He continued on a slightly sharper note: “And by the way, while we’re on the subject, why would I or any other member of my family have to justify anything we do? Sure, our dad’s the president, so it’s expected that he’ll be ridiculed and scrutinized more than anyone in the country, and we’re okay with that. What’s more, we’d be worried if all that somehow didn’t come with the territory. After all, it’s the job of the president to be held accountable for pretty much everything that happens in the country. On the other hand, the rest of us are there to help the guy, of course, but that doesn’t mean we need to stop being who we are or doing what we love. So what if my lawyer got paid with 2020 campaign money? It’s our money anyways and we’re allowed to do whatever we want with it. That was a perfectly legitimate move and anyone who says otherwise is delusional.”

“Besides, there’s a very obvious reason why I haven’t done anything wrong. If, God forbid, something bad should strike my father down, I will be the first in line to, how should I put this – succeed the throne. If he dies or becomes unfit for duty for some reason, I’ll be the next president, which means I’ll be the one running for presidency in 2020, which, by default, makes me the sole owner and proprietor of everything. At the end of the day, it doesn’t really matter where the money comes from as long as it keeps coming and there are no questions asked. Besides, I had a significant role in the preparation of the 2020 campaign, so I should at the very least have a say when it comes to who gets to do what with the money. That’s just the way the world works,” he concluded."

Strangely, however, the first-term lawmaker ranted about the teachers who brought the students to the building to talk to their representatives, The Topeka Capital-Journal reported. “I explained my clear position that ‘a man is a man, a woman is a woman, and marriage is between a man and a woman, and this is a reality that we cannot change,’” he wrote in the newsletter. “The teachers, one of whom was a man wearing a skirt ‘identifying’ as a woman, quickly led the students away.” However, according to Equality Kansas executive director Tom Witt, the only transgender teacher in attendance was wearing pants and never spoke with Awerkamp.

The lawmaker, however, continued his rant about how there can be “no mixing or blurring the lines between the sexes in this country,” because, apparently, “that leads to our downfall.” Asked to comment on his controversial Facebook newsletter, Awerkamp told portal KnowMyRepublican.com that he “never intended” to insult or pick on anyone in particular, but that he “couldn’t stand by and watch a vital American institution be ridiculed and mocked by some kind of new-age fad.” “I understand every single principle that this country is based on, believe me,” he said. “I’ve read the Constitution more times that you can imagine, and I know very well what it says. I also know that every couple of years, some new, epic fashion trend or something like that emerges and all of a sudden everybody expects centuries-old laws to change because of it. Well, I’m sorry, but that’s just not going to happen.”

He continued, “Unfortunately, that’s the downside of this prevailing, traditionally American way we raise our kids in. We teach them from a young age to follow their instincts, to believe in themselves and that they can change the world because of it. The thing is, we rarely teach them to tell the difference between what’s right and what’s not so right. When their instincts clash with traditional values, that’s when things become problematic. And that’s exactly what’s going on with gay people and these so-called trans-folks or whatever their name is. When one faces the facts, nobody is going to oppress them and they do deserve to live their lives in their own way, but as a minority. The majority of the population is still normal and will remain so in the future. Therefore, we need to make sure to set forth measures that will clearly separate straight people from gay and transgender people, so as not to confuse anyone. I know that sounds an awful lot like gender-based segregation but it’s not. It has a purpose.”

“Take women’s skirts, for instance. In this day and age, the line between traditional masculinity is becoming more and more blurred with every passing day. Women are working out and getting into bodybuilding, and are also taking over male jobs. Men, on the other hand, are wearing women’s clothing, applying makeup and are becoming more feminine. That’s exactly why I’ve come up with a bill whose purpose is to ban women from wearing colorful skirts in public, because people are, in light of everything aforementioned, genuinely mistaking them for trans-people. That’s causing awkward situations for both. So, in order to avoid that and in accordance with this latest fashion trend of men wearing women’s clothing – God forbid someone claims Kansas is unwilling to accept change – my bill aims to protect transgender men’s freedom of dressing. They will be allowed to wear women’s clothing, especially colorful skirts, while women will not, and that will clearly separate them from one another. It’s far from perfect, but I think this is a fine example of how open and liberal Republicans can be, on occasion,” Awerkamp concluded."

According to Priebus, what came through the House is not representative of what the final bill will look like. “It’s up to the Senate to make improvements if they’re to be made,” Priebus told Wallace. “Everyone is excited and ready to go to work and take the time necessary to look at the bill. No one’s going to be beating down their door.”

“But, before we go any further, Chris, I just have to ask one question here,” Priebus continued. “I realize everybody’s all fired up about this because, let’s face it, they’re just waiting for someone, anyone from the Trump administration to slip up and make a mistake so they’d have an excuse to lynch them. Now, regardless of the fact that I’m a part of that administration, I’d like it to be clear that, contrary to popular belief – I agree with that. I think we should be scrutinized because we can’t afford to slip up. However, regardless of my personal position on the matter, I can’t help but wonder – are those that are so adamant about finding a flaw in the Trump administration really that objective?”

“Nobody bothered to ask whether or not the increase in costs was in any way, shape or form justified,” Priebus said, and added, “the first thing everybody did, almost by instinct, was to jump out and grab President Trump by the throat and call him a liar. It didn’t even matter that this was not the final version of the bill; all that mattered was bashing on the president some more, whatever the reason. As a matter of fact, I’d say this was the perfect opportunity to see what the state of American politics has really turned into. But, that’s a story for another time. Anyway, let’s get back to the matter at hand. Bottom line, the prices will likely go up, though we still can’t say for sure by how much, but again – you guys aren’t asking the right questions, nobody is.”

“The fact to the matter is, we want everybody to have a healthcare system in place that treats everyone fairly. Even though there are countless problems when it comes to putting that into practice, the biggest challenge by far is allocating the cost in a way that’s proportional to the person’s sickness. Because, when you think about it – that’s the only fair mechanism that we can put in place that will have the effects we’re looking to achieve. So, in reality, the reason why older people should pay 5 times more than they’re paying right now is because the current system isn’t realistic. They are, in fact, 5 times sicker than the rest of the population, which is why they ought to pay more. This is all very simple, grade school math, I don’t get why you guys are struggling with it so much?” Priebus concluded."
0,http://politicalo.com/trump-god-created-fox-news-lead-support-presidency/,politicalo,Trump: “God Created Fox News To Lead And Support My Presidency”,[],"President Donald Trump reportedly records cable news throughout the day so he can catch up on how he is being covered before going to bed each night. Speaking on Slate’s Trump podcast on Monday, New York Magazine reporter Gabriel Sherman revealed that the president’s narcissistic personality manifests as an obsession with cable news. “People in Trump world say basically a lot of Fox,” Sherman explained. “But the other thing he does, from a source close to the White House told me that he does DVR basically all of the cable news.” Sherman noted that Fox News was Trump’s “primary source of live information,” adding that the president also consumes “a heavy digest of Breitbart.”

The president must have been watching the podcast live, apparently, because it didn’t take him long to get in touch with representatives of the media and argue that it is “his duty as the president” to be mindful of what’s being said about him. “You’ve got tons of examples throughout history of U.S. presidents who’ve done the same, and some were very smart to do that. Take Barack Obama, for example, he…well, wasn’t, unfortunately,” Trump opined. “Sure enough, he got all the so-called ‘liberal’ media in his pocket and then made damn sure to try to belittle yours truly, but didn’t do squat when it came to how he was covered and what was being said about him. I don’t plan on making the same mistake.”

He continued, “I’ve been burned once before and I’m not going to let my guard down again. As a matter of fact, it’s all a matter of perspective. This is a free country, the freest in the world, and we used to have complete freedom of press back in the day. Today it’s all different and you’ve all seen how much damage I sustained during my presidential campaign, after being constantly attacked by Obama and Crooked Hillary’s media powerhouses. That being said, I have to be fair and point out that not all the media were against me, which is to say, in the wrong. There were and still are a few shining examples of true journalism left in this country, two of which happen to be Breitbart and, of course, Fox News.”

“While we’re on the subject, let me tell you, I’m not a particularly religious person – I’m as much of a believer as the next guy – and everybody knows that, it’s no secret. But I have to say, when I look at everything I went through in the past year, it’s hard to ignore the fact that Fox News was pretty much the only institution that stood up for me in a completely objective and unbiased way. And I should know – I’ve kept track of these things. All that makes me confident that God was the one who created Fox News to help and support my presidency from the outset and throughout. If you ask me, there’s really no other way to look at it, since there’s no way in hell they’re making me look this good because they’re on my payroll. I would never own such an agency, firstly because it’s bad business, and secondly – if I did, you know it’d be full of smoking hot Eastern European models as anchors. So, that’s pretty much self explanatory,” the president concluded."

Josh Moore (R): “I’m Allowed To Grab Breastfeeders’ Nipples If They Use Them In Public”,['Lea Vat Kens'],"A New Hampshire state Rep. Josh Moore (R), who describes himself as a “pro-family” conservative, made an alarming comment on Facebook regarding the nipples of breastfeeding mothers if a law banning women exposing breasts in public did not pass. The comment was made in a squabble over proposed legislation that would make it a crime for women to expose their nipples in public. Currently in New Hampshire, both men and women are free to go topless, reports Slate. A bill sponsored solely by Republican men would change that, if it becomes law.

Namely, Moore took to Facebook to argue that “if women who want to breastfeed their children in public are allowed to expose their nipples, then I am also allowed to grab their nipples and play around with them.” When asked why he would perceive an otherwise normal and accepted practice of breastfeeding as “alarming” and “offensive,” Moore told media outlets that “it’s not about breastfeeding as an activity, it’s about the principle.”

“You know, why should I, or any other citizen of this great country, be forced to watch babies feeding in public? And when I say that, I emphasize that it’s not about the feeding itself, but the manner in which it is done. Breastfeeding in general doesn’t bother me at all, I consider it quite normal. However, breastfeeding in public infuriates me, because it means women have to bear their chest and nipples to do it, and that causes a distraction and sets a bad example for people, and especially, small children. We can’t have that, we just can’t,” the New Hampshire Rep. said.

He added, “See, the equivalent of that would be if every single man who is sexually aroused by a female walking by would be allowed to take his pants and underwear off and show his erection to his potential mate. And where would that lead us? Imagine hordes of men in the streets getting naked and walking around with erections, exposing themselves to small children. We have a name for people who do those things, and it’s sexual predators. We put people in jail for doing that, for Christ’s sake.”

“So, if we’re not going to put moms in jail for breastfeeding their babies in public, the least we can do in the best interest of equality is allow the men to come up to them and play around with their exposed nipples and areolas, BUT ONLY once the babies are finished feeding,” Moore opined. “We wouldn’t want to disturb the little ones’ eating habits, which are important for their growth. That being said, I don’t know about the rest of you, but I am going to start fondling away as soon as this interview is over.”"

Sarah Palin on Wednesday visited the White House with musicians Ted Nugent and Kid Rock. Palin posted photos from her visit, which were widely mocked on social media. Many users related the picture to her infamous 2008 interview, where then-vice presidential candidate Palin suggested Alaska’s proximity to Russia means “they’re [her] next-door neighbor.” That statement was panned by pundits and comics, most notable SNL’s Tina Fey, who played Palin on the sketch comedy show. During one segment, Fey-as-Palin proudly proclaimed, “I can see Russia from my house!” Trump has his fair share of connections to Russia; the FBI is currently investigating whether Trump officials coordinated with Russian operatives during the 2016 presidential election.

Surprisingly, it went somewhat unnoticed that Palin also tweeted from the White House. Posting a picture of her and Nugent, the tweet said, “The Real IQ Behind The Government.” In an interview later during the day with portal AlaskanInsider.com, she commented on the tweet and argued that social networks “much like God, work in mysterious ways.” “I mean, here’s a situation where you’ve got the three of us being literally crucified for visiting the White House, and on the other hand, something I tweeted while I was there goes relatively unnoticed. Not that I’m complaining of either scenario, but I just don’t get how these modern technologies work anymore,” she said.

The former half-term governor of Alaska also argued that her tweet was “as honest and heartfelt as they come,” given that her and Ted Nugent’s support to Donald Trump during his presidential campaign was “nothing short of epic.” “I mean, we weren’t members of his staff or anything, but we might as well have been. We were doing most of the public promotions, speeches – both on and off the record, talk shows, mentioned him in every interview or public appearance, I mean, you name it and Ted and I probably did it,” she said. “I’m not looking for recognition from Donald Trump or anyone for it, because we didn’t do it in order to get some personal benefit. We did it because we believed in the man as we still do. However, I won’t be sidelined now that the hard part’s over.”

She continued, “As a matter of fact, with all due respect to Donald, I would even go so far as to say that Ted and I hold an equal part in the fact that Donald Trump is now president. Kudos to all his strategists and his inner circle, but I won’t shy away from saying that we’re the ones who kept thinking ahead and making sure he was one step ahead of the Democrats. Ted’s direct approach to politics coupled with my perfectly timed rhetoric comprised a huge part of the power Donald Trump kept showing throughout his campaign. We supported him every step of the way and will continue to do so – again, not because we stand to gain something from it all, but because we believe he’s the right person for the job. It’s just that, we want it known that we are the real IQ behind the current government.”

“What’s more, I know for a fact that Ted is currently working on a new rock-style national anthem geared towards true Americans, not these imported ones. That’s how big of a patriot he is. Donald is going to love it, I’m sure of it,” she concluded."

While speaking to Oprah Winfrey last week, the first lady reflected on the emotions of some Americans who she said were “feeling what not having hope feels like” after Donald Trump’s 2016 victory. “You could really hear the disdain in her voice,” Ortagus said. “People need to understand the American people spoke, the Electoral College voted and it’s time to move on.”

“To be perfectly honest here,” the pundit said, “At a certain level, I can kind of understand why she’s feeling the way she is. But, at the same time, that’s the way of the world – she knew this was going to happen, she was completely aware that she couldn’t stay in the White House forever and she always had a pretty good idea that a Republican candidate could win the election. So, to say this comes as a surprise to her would be a lie, it’s as simple as that. She is a very intelligent woman and there’s no point in pretending otherwise.”

He continued, “It’s for that reason precisely that I’m somewhat confused by the way she reacts to all of this. I mean, she’s way past the point of being rude and she’s now just flat out insulting, without a single ounce of subtlety. If you ask me, Michelle Obama needs to get off her high horse and respect the fact that a non-gorilla-looking, real lady is finally coming to the White House again. And that goes especially for the pedestal-view the former First Lady has a way of using when talking about and even addressing Melania Trump. We get that there’s absolutely no love between the two of them, but that’s no reason to act like an actual gorilla, come on.”

Ortagus also argued that President Barack Obama’s wife “ought to take a page” from Laura Bush’s handbook, “who exercised extreme restraint and control when handing things off to her,” as well as, “avoided complaining about how Americans had lost hope because her husband George Bush was succeeded by Barack Obama.” “She was a real lady about it all and acted accordingly,” the pundit said. “And that’s precisely the kind of dignity and poise that Michelle Obama threw out the window when she decided that the fact that she was First Lady actually meant something to Americans. Somewhere along the line she must have lost track of the fact that First Ladies to Americans are nothing more than trophy wives – all that matters is if they’re hot enough. And she just wasn’t.”

“Donald Trump’s wife, on the other hand, is not only the spitting image of class and elegance – she’s so hot she could easily be arrested for single-handedly being responsible for global warming. And I don’t really care if you’re into interracial or not, but when it comes down to it, I’d rather see a dirty movie starring Melania Trump than Michelle Obama. Granted, a threesome would be awesome, but that’s another story. Bottom line – Michelle Obama needs to respect the fact that a woman who’s not only way hotter, but is also a bigger lady than her is coming to the White House. Finally, I might add, after 8 years of terror. Because, her life won’t be over when she steps out of there, she’ll have to live with herself afterwards. And that’s a very difficult thing to do when you’re so bitter and full of despair and hopelessness,” he concluded."

Several economic justice groups organized The Tax Protest in an effort to get protesters out in over 200 cities across the country.

Conway also said that the protests are “ridiculous,” not only because they’re deliberately disrupting law and order “in a time of great need for the country,” but also because Republicans “never protested against an elected president.” “I get that this is where you’re trying to exercise your right to free speech and all that, but at the end of the day, the only thing you’re doing is you’re overreacting to something that’s perfectly within the president’s legal limitations. President Trump is not breaking any laws whatsoever, so I think everyone just needs to take it down a notch and go back to their normal lives,” President Trump’s adviser opined. “Our country is under threat of nuclear war, this is the last thing we need right now.”

Conway also argued that it was Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) who had a “moral responsibility” to make sure protesters dispersed and went back to their homes, because he is the “best known democratic leader and liberal politician around.” “He seemed so eager to have a job during the election last year, and some of the things he said back then really seemed to resonate with Americans. However, I’m now asking Senator Sanders to put his money where his mouth is and do his part in quelling these pointless and utterly ridiculous protests. People tend to listen to him for some reason, which is why I believe he should do the patriotic thing and help out in this hour of need,” Conway said.

“If I remember correctly, tax policy was one of the staples of Sanders’ political campaign, which is part of the reason why I think he’s the ideal person to talk to the people and explain to them that what Benjamin Franklin said was true – there are only two things that are certain in life, and those are death and taxes,” she argued. “Taxes are a constant and must be paid because they serve the greater good, and one person who’s been certainly paying his share is President Donald Trump. The other part of the reason why Bernie Sanders is the man for the job is the fact that he understands that Republicans have never done anything like this against an elected president.”

“It’s hypocritical to go out there and claim you’re protesting something like this when everybody knows that you just can’t fool the government. North Korea is acting up again, we’re getting ready for war and we need all the funding we can get. Republicans have never done anything like this in the history of our nation, which just goes to show that Democrats are the only disruptive element nowadays. These protesters are almost as crazy as Bernie himself, and that’s why it should be his job and his responsibility to get them off the streets. Should he refuse, I’m afraid he’ll go down in history as the only liberal who’s ever refused to cooperate with a Republican president. And they call us the bad guys,” she concluded."

O’Reilly was away from his show on a “pre-planned” vacation when the announcement was made. “After a thorough and careful review of the allegations, the Company and Bill O’Reilly have agreed that Bill O’Reilly will not be returning to the Fox News Channel,” parent company 21st Century Fox said in a statement Wednesday. The announcement came after six women accused O’Reilly, 67, of inappropriate behavior. A New York Times investigation published April 1 revealed O’Reilly and Fox News had settled with five women for a total of $13 million, while another woman recently came forward with allegations.

Reacting to the news, former half-term governor of Alaska Sarah Palin commented in an interview with portal KnowMyRepublican.com that she was “very excited” to learn that Fox was opening up the position. “Even though I’ve known Bill for many years and have no intention whatsoever of believing a word of the accusations, I still can’t help but feel optimistic about the fact that Fox is now looking for someone to fill his shoes,” Palin said. “As for Bill, I don’t think he’ll be particularly sad about what’s happened, considering he’s done very well for himself and is taken care of financially speaking. The only thing I can think of that could potentially bother him is knowing that he won’t be able to make waves in politics anymore.”

She continued, “On the other hand, regardless of the fact that many new faces are currently being considered to fill the gap, I still have to point out that Fox management should take a look in my direction. As for what it is that makes me qualified to take up his show or a show in that slot, well, I have to say that I’m pretty much the smartest person I know, even though I’m well aware that it sounds like I’m bragging when I say something like that. However, I can assure you that’s not the case. That being said, I don’t think I’m that bad on the eyes either, which, with all due respect to Bill, will certainly be an improvement in the eyes of the viewers.”

“Add then there’s also the fact that there’s absolutely zero risk of me harassing any female employees on the job, since I’m straight. Though, the men better watch out when I’m around, since I know the network has an unofficial tendency to hire both male and female eye-candy exclusively. And like I said, if Fox is looking to trade up from Bill and put a new spin on the program, I’ll be waiting for their call. I know I won’t make the same waves as Bill, but I’ll sure as hell be asking the same tough and awkward questions. And if things get too complicated for the viewers – hey, I’m a not-too-bad-looking woman, it’s all good. Worst case scenario – I’ve never heard of men filing a sexual harassment lawsuit anywhere. It’s a win-win, I’m telling you,” she concluded."

According to Priebus, what came through the House is not representative of what the final bill will look like. “It’s up to the Senate to make improvements if they’re to be made,” Priebus told Wallace. “Everyone is excited and ready to go to work and take the time necessary to look at the bill. No one’s going to be beating down their door.”

“But, before we go any further, Chris, I just have to ask one question here,” Priebus continued. “I realize everybody’s all fired up about this because, let’s face it, they’re just waiting for someone, anyone from the Trump administration to slip up and make a mistake so they’d have an excuse to lynch them. Now, regardless of the fact that I’m a part of that administration, I’d like it to be clear that, contrary to popular belief – I agree with that. I think we should be scrutinized because we can’t afford to slip up. However, regardless of my personal position on the matter, I can’t help but wonder – are those that are so adamant about finding a flaw in the Trump administration really that objective?”

“Nobody bothered to ask whether or not the increase in costs was in any way, shape or form justified,” Priebus said, and added, “the first thing everybody did, almost by instinct, was to jump out and grab President Trump by the throat and call him a liar. It didn’t even matter that this was not the final version of the bill; all that mattered was bashing on the president some more, whatever the reason. As a matter of fact, I’d say this was the perfect opportunity to see what the state of American politics has really turned into. But, that’s a story for another time. Anyway, let’s get back to the matter at hand. Bottom line, the prices will likely go up, though we still can’t say for sure by how much, but again – you guys aren’t asking the right questions, nobody is.”

“The fact to the matter is, we want everybody to have a healthcare system in place that treats everyone fairly. Even though there are countless problems when it comes to putting that into practice, the biggest challenge by far is allocating the cost in a way that’s proportional to the person’s sickness. Because, when you think about it – that’s the only fair mechanism that we can put in place that will have the effects we’re looking to achieve. So, in reality, the reason why older people should pay 5 times more than they’re paying right now is because the current system isn’t realistic. They are, in fact, 5 times sicker than the rest of the population, which is why they ought to pay more. This is all very simple, grade school math, I don’t get why you guys are struggling with it so much?” Priebus concluded."
0,http://politicot.com/trump-god-created-fox-news-lead-support-presidency/,politicalo,Trump: “God Created Fox News To Lead And Support My Presidency”,[],"President Donald Trump reportedly records cable news throughout the day so he can catch up on how he is being covered before going to bed each night. Speaking on Slate’s Trump podcast on Monday, New York Magazine reporter Gabriel Sherman revealed that the president’s narcissistic personality manifests as an obsession with cable news. “People in Trump world say basically a lot of Fox,” Sherman explained. “But the other thing he does, from a source close to the White House told me that he does DVR basically all of the cable news.” Sherman noted that Fox News was Trump’s “primary source of live information,” adding that the president also consumes “a heavy digest of Breitbart.”

The president must have been watching the podcast live, apparently, because it didn’t take him long to get in touch with representatives of the media and argue that it is “his duty as the president” to be mindful of what’s being said about him. “You’ve got tons of examples throughout history of U.S. presidents who’ve done the same, and some were very smart to do that. Take Barack Obama, for example, he…well, wasn’t, unfortunately,” Trump opined. “Sure enough, he got all the so-called ‘liberal’ media in his pocket and then made damn sure to try to belittle yours truly, but didn’t do squat when it came to how he was covered and what was being said about him. I don’t plan on making the same mistake.”

He continued, “I’ve been burned once before and I’m not going to let my guard down again. As a matter of fact, it’s all a matter of perspective. This is a free country, the freest in the world, and we used to have complete freedom of press back in the day. Today it’s all different and you’ve all seen how much damage I sustained during my presidential campaign, after being constantly attacked by Obama and Crooked Hillary’s media powerhouses. That being said, I have to be fair and point out that not all the media were against me, which is to say, in the wrong. There were and still are a few shining examples of true journalism left in this country, two of which happen to be Breitbart and, of course, Fox News.”

“While we’re on the subject, let me tell you, I’m not a particularly religious person – I’m as much of a believer as the next guy – and everybody knows that, it’s no secret. But I have to say, when I look at everything I went through in the past year, it’s hard to ignore the fact that Fox News was pretty much the only institution that stood up for me in a completely objective and unbiased way. And I should know – I’ve kept track of these things. All that makes me confident that God was the one who created Fox News to help and support my presidency from the outset and throughout. If you ask me, there’s really no other way to look at it, since there’s no way in hell they’re making me look this good because they’re on my payroll. I would never own such an agency, firstly because it’s bad business, and secondly – if I did, you know it’d be full of smoking hot Eastern European models as anchors. So, that’s pretty much self explanatory,” the president concluded."

Josh Moore (R): “I’m Allowed To Grab Breastfeeders’ Nipples If They Use Them In Public”,['Lea Vat Kens'],"A New Hampshire state Rep. Josh Moore (R), who describes himself as a “pro-family” conservative, made an alarming comment on Facebook regarding the nipples of breastfeeding mothers if a law banning women exposing breasts in public did not pass. The comment was made in a squabble over proposed legislation that would make it a crime for women to expose their nipples in public. Currently in New Hampshire, both men and women are free to go topless, reports Slate. A bill sponsored solely by Republican men would change that, if it becomes law.

Namely, Moore took to Facebook to argue that “if women who want to breastfeed their children in public are allowed to expose their nipples, then I am also allowed to grab their nipples and play around with them.” When asked why he would perceive an otherwise normal and accepted practice of breastfeeding as “alarming” and “offensive,” Moore told media outlets that “it’s not about breastfeeding as an activity, it’s about the principle.”

“You know, why should I, or any other citizen of this great country, be forced to watch babies feeding in public? And when I say that, I emphasize that it’s not about the feeding itself, but the manner in which it is done. Breastfeeding in general doesn’t bother me at all, I consider it quite normal. However, breastfeeding in public infuriates me, because it means women have to bear their chest and nipples to do it, and that causes a distraction and sets a bad example for people, and especially, small children. We can’t have that, we just can’t,” the New Hampshire Rep. said.

He added, “See, the equivalent of that would be if every single man who is sexually aroused by a female walking by would be allowed to take his pants and underwear off and show his erection to his potential mate. And where would that lead us? Imagine hordes of men in the streets getting naked and walking around with erections, exposing themselves to small children. We have a name for people who do those things, and it’s sexual predators. We put people in jail for doing that, for Christ’s sake.”

“So, if we’re not going to put moms in jail for breastfeeding their babies in public, the least we can do in the best interest of equality is allow the men to come up to them and play around with their exposed nipples and areolas, BUT ONLY once the babies are finished feeding,” Moore opined. “We wouldn’t want to disturb the little ones’ eating habits, which are important for their growth. That being said, I don’t know about the rest of you, but I am going to start fondling away as soon as this interview is over.”"

Sarah Palin on Wednesday visited the White House with musicians Ted Nugent and Kid Rock. Palin posted photos from her visit, which were widely mocked on social media. Many users related the picture to her infamous 2008 interview, where then-vice presidential candidate Palin suggested Alaska’s proximity to Russia means “they’re [her] next-door neighbor.” That statement was panned by pundits and comics, most notable SNL’s Tina Fey, who played Palin on the sketch comedy show. During one segment, Fey-as-Palin proudly proclaimed, “I can see Russia from my house!” Trump has his fair share of connections to Russia; the FBI is currently investigating whether Trump officials coordinated with Russian operatives during the 2016 presidential election.

Surprisingly, it went somewhat unnoticed that Palin also tweeted from the White House. Posting a picture of her and Nugent, the tweet said, “The Real IQ Behind The Government.” In an interview later during the day with portal AlaskanInsider.com, she commented on the tweet and argued that social networks “much like God, work in mysterious ways.” “I mean, here’s a situation where you’ve got the three of us being literally crucified for visiting the White House, and on the other hand, something I tweeted while I was there goes relatively unnoticed. Not that I’m complaining of either scenario, but I just don’t get how these modern technologies work anymore,” she said.

The former half-term governor of Alaska also argued that her tweet was “as honest and heartfelt as they come,” given that her and Ted Nugent’s support to Donald Trump during his presidential campaign was “nothing short of epic.” “I mean, we weren’t members of his staff or anything, but we might as well have been. We were doing most of the public promotions, speeches – both on and off the record, talk shows, mentioned him in every interview or public appearance, I mean, you name it and Ted and I probably did it,” she said. “I’m not looking for recognition from Donald Trump or anyone for it, because we didn’t do it in order to get some personal benefit. We did it because we believed in the man as we still do. However, I won’t be sidelined now that the hard part’s over.”

She continued, “As a matter of fact, with all due respect to Donald, I would even go so far as to say that Ted and I hold an equal part in the fact that Donald Trump is now president. Kudos to all his strategists and his inner circle, but I won’t shy away from saying that we’re the ones who kept thinking ahead and making sure he was one step ahead of the Democrats. Ted’s direct approach to politics coupled with my perfectly timed rhetoric comprised a huge part of the power Donald Trump kept showing throughout his campaign. We supported him every step of the way and will continue to do so – again, not because we stand to gain something from it all, but because we believe he’s the right person for the job. It’s just that, we want it known that we are the real IQ behind the current government.”

“What’s more, I know for a fact that Ted is currently working on a new rock-style national anthem geared towards true Americans, not these imported ones. That’s how big of a patriot he is. Donald is going to love it, I’m sure of it,” she concluded."

While speaking to Oprah Winfrey last week, the first lady reflected on the emotions of some Americans who she said were “feeling what not having hope feels like” after Donald Trump’s 2016 victory. “You could really hear the disdain in her voice,” Ortagus said. “People need to understand the American people spoke, the Electoral College voted and it’s time to move on.”

“To be perfectly honest here,” the pundit said, “At a certain level, I can kind of understand why she’s feeling the way she is. But, at the same time, that’s the way of the world – she knew this was going to happen, she was completely aware that she couldn’t stay in the White House forever and she always had a pretty good idea that a Republican candidate could win the election.

Rand Paul (R-KY) said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” that he believes President Donald Trump has the ability to pardon himself. Host Jake Tapper asked Paul if he believes Trump has the power to do so and Paul replied, “I think in all likelihood he does. I think that some of this hasn’t been adjudicated.” Trump himself believes he has the “complete power” to pardon, however, he tweeted out Saturday that he has nothing to pardon himself from.

However, as Paul stressed out during his interview on CNN, “at this point it is irrelevant whether or not President Trump is accused of this so-called crime – whatever his accusers conjure up, it won’t work. Donald Trump is President of the United States, and as such, has the power to pardon any and all persons at his own discretion. It might sound unfair to some, but it’s one of the perks of the job. That’s just how the Constitution works.”

When Tapper persisted in pushing Paul to comment more on the allegations that President Trump cheated during his presidential campaign as well as the election, the senator from Kentucky argued that he “already commented on the issue” and that there was “nothing more left to say.” “It’s just one of those things where it’s become useless to talk about any of it, because it’s in the past. It’s already happened and nothing we do now can change the consequences,” he said.

“Surely you’re not saying that Donald Trump can’t suffer consequences for cheating his way into the presidency?” Tapper insisted. Paul replied, “No, of course not, but you have to look at it like this: we don’t really care if Donald Trump cheated his way into the presidency or not; for that matter, we don’t even care if he’s found guilty or not. The fact to the matter is, like I said – the man possesses the legal power to pardon anyone he chooses in any given situation, and that includes himself. He’d be a fool not to use that option if the circumstances call for it.”

Paul also added, “We can’t allow ourselves to blame Donald Trump of anything we put him in power to do. It doesn’t work like that. There’s a reason our Constitution predicts a four-year term for every head of state. That time is given to every president to do his part for his country and, during that time, he should be left alone to do his work. What kind of a nation would be we if we were to drive out every single president after six months or something just because we weren’t sure of his motives? Like I said, it doesn’t work like that.”

“My point is – we shouldn’t care how Donald Trump won the presidency. It’s kind of like with rich people: you should never ask them how they came by their first million; other than that, you can ask them anything. What’s important now is focusing on the work that lies ahead for this country. As far as its president is concerned, he’s a smart man, he’ll solve any problems we face in the future. And if he’s found guilty – well, he’ll solve that problem too, let’s put it like that,” Paul concluded."

Long gone are the days where people were only able to look at things as outsiders, when the only option was to watch a story or observe catalogue pictures designed by someone else. Modern technology has enabled the creation of much more immersive experiences, and things like virtual reality and live streaming are changing the way we watch films, play games, and shop. Now that the furniture giant IKEA has jumped on the VR bandwagon, more businesses could soon be following suit.

IKEA is famous for its catalogues in which every room of the house is shown in a range of different designs, and its huge warehouses that allow customers to explore and see how things look for themselves before buying. This form of display helps home owners visualize how items will look in their own homes, and the method has helped IKEA become one of the biggest furniture outlets in the world. It is, in fact, number 41 in the Forbes list of the World’s Most Valuable Brands with a value of $13.5 billion as of May 2017. But now that there is virtual reality available, why should customers have to tire themselves out by walking around the sprawling Swedish store? The top dogs at IKEA have realised that this is an area that needs to be addressed, and have created a pilot VR app which allows customers to explore a virtual kitchen. The virtual shopper can then change the colour of certain surfaces and furniture, add products and remove them, and explore what their ideal kitchen looks like in practice.



However, IKEA is somewhat behind the times when it comes to offering a more immersive online experience, as other industries such as the online casino sector have been providing this for their customers for a while now. While online casino software providers are still scrambling to create games for VR, some sites are offering an experience which is just like Las Vegas thanks to the live links available to real tables and games. Instead of having to visit the famous strip or even enter a local casino, players can now interact with real croupiers via webcam, making use of tech such as OCR and 4G as they stake on classic games such as roulette and blackjack.

Something else which is getting the immersive and interactive treatment is storytelling. Some children’s books over the years have given readers the chance to choose the way the story develops, but according to the Guardian this is now an option for TV series and films geared towards adults. One example of this is Her Story, which is described as a cross between Luthor and Jonathan Creek. Viewers watch the film in a non-linear fashion, as they choose to follow up leads and solve a crime. Games such as Until Dawn have also experimented with this, and it could be an exciting new way to consume media if more writers follow suit.

The rise of these immersive online experiences and the way they are changing important sectors like entertainment for the better, is one of the main reasons why VR is predicted to be a major platform in the years to come. In a few years when the headsets become more affordable, nearly everything could incorporate some aspects of the new technology."

Sources tell CNN that Trump’s rebuke of Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia probe “is causing deep alarm inside the West Wing, leading some to worry that their loyalty to Trump might not be reciprocated from the man in the Oval Office.” “It’s chilling,” one White House official told CNN. Another White House official said that Trump’s attack was particularly jarring because Sessions has been one of the president’s most loyal cabinet members. “No one was more loyal than Sessions,” the official emphasized. “No one.”

Commenting on his attack on Jeff Sessions, President Trump told portal KnowMyRepublican.com that he did “what had to be done” and that nobody should be surprised by his words, because “I want the people of America to know that the age of political correctness is gone and that, from now on, we’re going to call things by their true name regardless of who gets offended by it.” “That’s how the president of this country, of any country for that matter, is supposed to deal with traitors,” he said. “Because they don’t deserve anything better than that. To betray my trust is one thing, that’s of secondary importance. But, to betray this country and its people, that’s the part I can’t forgive. Had I known this would happen, I never would have offered him the job.”

He continued, “Jeff Sessions was the man who had my utmost confidence and trust. You don’t just go out and recuse yourself from something like this without, at the very least, giving me a warning before you go through with it. No, such a thing doesn’t happen spontaneously; I refuse to believe that the Jeff Sessions I once knew would do something like this, even unintentionally. He must have been brainwashed; what’s more, the man was obviously planted by Obama to destroy me. That’s the only reasonable explanation I can think of to account for his actions. That, and the other one is that he’s suddenly developed Alzheimer’s or dementia. But, seeing how he’s still sharp-minded, I’d say the former makes a lot more sense.”

“It must have been fairly easy to get to him, too. He gets around and knows a lot of people, and Obama’s got eyes and ears everywhere. But, the thing I’m struggling to figure out is, why now? He must have had countless other opportunities to act, things he could have done to cause much more damage to me and this country. Then again, if he could have Hillary Clinton running for president after him in spite of everything she’s done, having his CIA guys brainwash Jeff Sessions must have been like a walk in the park. You know, I have to note, one never truly gets used to how the Democrats operate and how far they’re willing to go sometimes. They’re almost like the Nazis – they have guys everywhere and know everything and they don’t care what it is they do and who they ruin as long as they get what they want. The difference is, the Nazis loved Germany and did everything for its sake – I think we’re all seeing that’s not the case with Barack Obama and the Democrats,” Trump concluded."

During a speech on the Senate floor Tuesday, McConnell said that it was sad that Democrats were celebrating the failure of the Republican Party’s bill. Neither McConnell nor President Trump ever reached out to Democrats on the bill and Democrats refused to deal on a bill that would “repeal and replace Obamacare.” Instead, they have said they prefer to “fix Obamacare.” “These are not just numbers on a page, these are real people,” McConnell said. Recent polling reveals the majority of Americans want to keep Obamacare.

After his speech at the Senate, McConnell told portal KnowMyRepublican.com that he was “truly disappointed” by the fact that his fellow Americans, regardless of the fact that some of them “only differ” in political views, still failed to realize that Trumpcare is “a better health care system than Obamacare will ever be.” “I am sad and also a bit hurt that I was standing in a room where nearly half of the people shot down a historic opportunity to make this country a better place for all citizens, and especially poor people,” McConnell said. “The only thing that separates us in there is our political views and that’s it. Take that away and you have a room full of Americans who are supposed to be on the same page when it comes to what needs to be done in this country. Apparently, I was wrong.”

He continued, “The defeat of Trumpcare demonstrated – in my eyes, at least – that only Republicans in this country, and more importantly, in the Senate, believe in poor people’s right to health. That’s the message I got in there just now. Because, at this point, it’s preposterous to even consider any Democrat will ever be open to the idea of Trumpcare replacing former President Obama’s health care system. By definition, that means that Republicans are the only ones who are working hard to give poor people free health care. President Trump is faced with numerous problems right now, the fake news lobby, the media’s persecution, the Russia investigation, he’s got a lot on his plate right now. And still he found the time to roll up his sleeves and come up with something for those of who have nothing.”

“All Democrats ever do is talk. They talk about liberalism, they talk about equality, they talk about LGBTQ rights, they talk about freedom of choice and what not, and yet, at the same time, they deny the freedom of free health care for the poorest citizens of this country. Because, that’s what they proved when they shot down Trumpcare. They’re all talk and no show. However, it’s the Republicans’ fault that’s the case, right? Somehow, they will found a way to blame it all on traditionalism and traditional values. Well, let me tell you something: Democrats just deprived millions of poor Americans free health care. That’s the same as rounding them up and stuffing them into gas chambers for execution like the Nazis used to do. It’s the same thing, only the Nazis made quick work of it. The Democrats made sure poor people’s deaths will be slow and agonizing,” McConnell concluded."
0,http://politicalo.com/brit-hume-giving-health-insurance-sick-people-defeats-core-ethic-values-country/,politicalo,Brit Hume: “Giving Health Insurance To Sick People Defeats The Core Ethic Values Of This Country”,[],"During a discussion on the GOP’s healthcare plan designed to replace Obamacare, longtime Fox contributor Brit Hume criticized compelling insurers to cover people with pre-existing conditions, reports Media Matters. Speaking with “Fox News Sunday” host Chris Wallace and Obamacare architect Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, Hume called coverage of those with pre-existing conditions not a “triumph,” but problematic, like insuring a driver who has a car wreck in their past. “The triumph of Obamacare is this coverage for pre-existing conditions, which basically defeats the whole idea of insurance,” Hume suggested. “Which is, for example, in the automobile insurance market, if you could wait until you had a wreck and then buy insurance and have the repairs covered, that’s comparable to what we’re doing here.”

He continued, “What people tend to miss when it comes to this whole story about the wrongful glorification of Obamacare is the fact that it hurts the country in more ways than one. I’m not going to sit here and claim that it’s all bad and that it doesn’t have any upsides; of course it does, it helps those that can’t help themselves and that’s all fine and dandy from a spiritual point of view, so to speak. However, we don’t live in the spiritual world. We’re comprised of living, breathing cells that need oxygen and food and our existence here has a lot more to do with monetary values than spiritual ones, whether we like it or not. And if we have a health care system in place, which we do, that’s designed to fix one problem and it ends up creating ten times more problems than it repairs, then it has to go, period.”

“But even more than that, the thing that bothers me is the philosophy behind Obamacare, which is even more devastating than the damage it’s doing to the federal budget,” Hume continued. “Obamacare was designed to help the poorest and sickest citizens out there. However, as noble as that sounds, the consequence of such logic is the fact that it neglects the core ethic values that were embedded in the Constitution and that comprise the basic philosophy of this country: spend your life working hard, playing hard and not burdening others with your problems. Make yourself capable of anything and all shall be given to you. That means that every American’s basic responsibility is to take care of themselves first, which is to say, make sure they don’t get sick and fall into the care of others. If that happens, you’ve pretty much lost the right to call yourself an American, as cruel as that sounds.”

“Therefore, giving free health insurance to sick people and those with pre-existing conditions pretty much defeats the core ethic principle of this great country. If you want to be one of us, you have to carry your own weight and take care of yourself. You do that by being careful about what you eat, how you spend your time and how you conduct yourself every single minute of every single day. If you’re at a point where you’re both poor and you get sick, it’s your own fault. Nobody made you sick out of nowhere. You’re the only person responsible, you did that to yourself by not taking care of your health. And if you aren’t willing to take the time and effort to pay attention to the choices you make every single day of your life, why should the government? If you don’t value your health, why should other people? It’s never right to take food from other people’s mouths in order to feed yourself. Passively forcing others to clean up your mess and pay for your hospital bills through higher taxes is not compassion, it’s silent robbery,” Hume concluded."

Just two weeks prior to the release of emails documenting Trump, Jr.s’ meeting with Kremlin-linked attorney Nataliya Veselnitskaya, Trump’s reelection campaign paid $50,000 to the law offices of Alan Futerfas, The Daily Beast reports. “Trump Jr. does not yet face any official allegations of legal wrongdoing, but he and the White House have scrambled to contain the political fallout from the controversy,” The Beast explained. “It was not immediately clear whether the campaign expenditure was remuneration for Futerfas’s representation of Trump’s son on Russia-related or other matters. But the payment sticks out on a presidential campaign’s expenditure list: Futerfas’s expertise is in white collar criminal defense, not political and election law.”

Meanwhile, Trump Jr. addressed the controversy, arguing that he “never meant to hide such information from the public,” but also that “the public has to understand that these sort of things are subject to various protocols set in place for the safety of the family.” “Believe me when I say that there are good times to be a Trump, but there are also some very, very bad times to be a member of this family. This just happens to be one of the latter. However, I’d like to add that there has never before been a case in American history where such a powerful family made it into the White House as a whole. Therefore, you can’t expect all of us to act differently all of a sudden just because one of us managed to get a hold of the presidency. The rest of us still have very important jobs to do, and doing business requires a lot of money nowadays.”

He continued on a slightly sharper note: “And by the way, while we’re on the subject, why would I or any other member of my family have to justify anything we do? Sure, our dad’s the president, so it’s expected that he’ll be ridiculed and scrutinized more than anyone in the country, and we’re okay with that. What’s more, we’d be worried if all that somehow didn’t come with the territory. After all, it’s the job of the president to be held accountable for pretty much everything that happens in the country. On the other hand, the rest of us are there to help the guy, of course, but that doesn’t mean we need to stop being who we are or doing what we love. So what if my lawyer got paid with 2020 campaign money? It’s our money anyways and we’re allowed to do whatever we want with it. That was a perfectly legitimate move and anyone who says otherwise is delusional.”

“Besides, there’s a very obvious reason why I haven’t done anything wrong. If, God forbid, something bad should strike my father down, I will be the first in line to, how should I put this – succeed the throne. If he dies or becomes unfit for duty for some reason, I’ll be the next president, which means I’ll be the one running for presidency in 2020, which, by default, makes me the sole owner and proprietor of everything. At the end of the day, it doesn’t really matter where the money comes from as long as it keeps coming and there are no questions asked. Besides, I had a significant role in the preparation of the 2020 campaign, so I should at the very least have a say when it comes to who gets to do what with the money. That’s just the way the world works,” he concluded."

Strangely, however, the first-term lawmaker ranted about the teachers who brought the students to the building to talk to their representatives, The Topeka Capital-Journal reported. “I explained my clear position that ‘a man is a man, a woman is a woman, and marriage is between a man and a woman, and this is a reality that we cannot change,’” he wrote in the newsletter. “The teachers, one of whom was a man wearing a skirt ‘identifying’ as a woman, quickly led the students away.” However, according to Equality Kansas executive director Tom Witt, the only transgender teacher in attendance was wearing pants and never spoke with Awerkamp.

The lawmaker, however, continued his rant about how there can be “no mixing or blurring the lines between the sexes in this country,” because, apparently, “that leads to our downfall.” Asked to comment on his controversial Facebook newsletter, Awerkamp told portal KnowMyRepublican.com that he “never intended” to insult or pick on anyone in particular, but that he “couldn’t stand by and watch a vital American institution be ridiculed and mocked by some kind of new-age fad.” “I understand every single principle that this country is based on, believe me,” he said. “I’ve read the Constitution more times that you can imagine, and I know very well what it says. I also know that every couple of years, some new, epic fashion trend or something like that emerges and all of a sudden everybody expects centuries-old laws to change because of it. Well, I’m sorry, but that’s just not going to happen.”

He continued, “Unfortunately, that’s the downside of this prevailing, traditionally American way we raise our kids in. We teach them from a young age to follow their instincts, to believe in themselves and that they can change the world because of it. The thing is, we rarely teach them to tell the difference between what’s right and what’s not so right. When their instincts clash with traditional values, that’s when things become problematic. And that’s exactly what’s going on with gay people and these so-called trans-folks or whatever their name is. When one faces the facts, nobody is going to oppress them and they do deserve to live their lives in their own way, but as a minority. The majority of the population is still normal and will remain so in the future. Therefore, we need to make sure to set forth measures that will clearly separate straight people from gay and transgender people, so as not to confuse anyone. I know that sounds an awful lot like gender-based segregation but it’s not. It has a purpose.”

“Take women’s skirts, for instance. In this day and age, the line between traditional masculinity is becoming more and more blurred with every passing day. Women are working out and getting into bodybuilding, and are also taking over male jobs. Men, on the other hand, are wearing women’s clothing, applying makeup and are becoming more feminine. That’s exactly why I’ve come up with a bill whose purpose is to ban women from wearing colorful skirts in public, because people are, in light of everything aforementioned, genuinely mistaking them for trans-people. That’s causing awkward situations for both. So, in order to avoid that and in accordance with this latest fashion trend of men wearing women’s clothing – God forbid someone claims Kansas is unwilling to accept change – my bill aims to protect transgender men’s freedom of dressing. They will be allowed to wear women’s clothing, especially colorful skirts, while women will not, and that will clearly separate them from one another. It’s far from perfect, but I think this is a fine example of how open and liberal Republicans can be, on occasion,” Awerkamp concluded."

In 2006, Trump told The View that, “if Ivanka weren’t my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.”

Commenting on his statement, the president also said that his daughter’s life is “far from sunshine and rainbows everybody thinks it is.” In an interview with portal KnowMyRepublican.com, President Trump also argued that being rich “is not as easy as it seems,” as well as that “it is 10 times as difficult to be born rich as the son or daughter to rich parents than it is to be born poor and then have to work hard to become rich.” “Most people think these things get easier with time; that couldn’t be farther from the truth,” Trump said.

“As a matter of fact, rich people’s kids suffer way more than any other kids, and that includes homeless people and all that,” he continued. “And I know what you’re going to say: what is this guy on about, is he for real? I’m telling you, when you have nothing, then you have no reason to fight, or argue, or bicker amongst yourselves and with other members of your family. Poverty makes you more connected to your loved ones and strengthens family bonds. Wealth, on the other hand, I’m telling you, it’s more of a curse than a blessing.”

“Take Ivanka, for example. She’s the apple of my eye, but she’s not had an easy life. She has suffered a lot, primarily because of the fact that she’s Donald Trump’s daughter,” Trump said. “There’s a lot of responsibility and obligations that come with being Donald Trump, and there’s no way you can protect your kids from all that. As a matter of fact, sometimes I feel sorry for Ivanka because I look at her and all I can see are those poor Syrian children that are struggling with losing their homes and parents because of the war. That goes especially for refugees; I see what they’re going through and how they’re forced to move along, to forget what little roots they’ve learned they had, and grow up over night.”

“When I think about how much Ivanka had to travel around the world when she was little just so she could spend time with me, it breaks my heart. I remember, I had to overcompensate for my absence by throwing tons of material things at her, things I knew deep down she didn’t want. But I guess that’s what a father does when he’s reduced to his work and nothing more. Make no mistake – my daughter has suffered tremendously even though she grew up well taken care of. But she spent just as much time traveling around, if not more, as those refugee children from Syria. She is one with them because she too lived in over a dozen different countries by the time she was 15. It was not an easy life and that’s why she deserves the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the important work she’s doing for me today,” Trump concluded."
0,http://politicot.com/spicer-trump-legal-right-cancel-scotus-serve-pleasure/,politicalo,Spicer: “Trump Has The Legal Right To Cancel SCOTUS Because They Serve At His Pleasure”,['Alex Stevan'],"During a Monday press conference that media outlets were banned from airing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer announced that the president was sending “thoughts and prayers” to the victims of an alleged terrorist attack in London and to the families of seven dead U.S. sailors. Spicer defended the ban on broadcasting the briefing by noting that President Donald Trump had already appeared on camera on Monday for several minutes, although he took no questions. Spicer also said that the president had confidence in all the members of the Justice Department, including Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is reportedly investigating the president for obstruction of justice. He also insisted that Trump has the power to fire Mueller if necessary. “If you serve at the pleasure of the president, you serve at the pleasure of the president,” he said. “That is a fact.”

Asked by several reporters to clarify the full extent of the president’s power, or in other words, its limitations – if they exist – Spicer argued that the Constitution “clearly states” what the President of the United States can and cannot do. “However,” he added, “one must also recognize the fact that our Constitution was written quite a while ago and, as such, isn’t ideal when it comes to facing the issues that plague the American society nowadays. One of those issues is also the limit of the president’s power. Just like our language and many other things that are typically American, our Constitution is also a living thing that changes and evolves as time goes by. And if it doesn’t do so on its own, then it has us, the people of America, to help it. However, seeing how the people already have more than enough on their plate these days, the president has decided not to bother you folks with such boring decisions.”

Spicer continued, “As a result, the president of the country nowadays has very different legal and executive abilities than those of many of his predecessors, especially some of the first ones like George Washington or Thomas Jefferson. As a matter of fact, in order to be able to deal with the problems of today, which vary incredibly compared to ones that existed when the Constitution was written, Donald Trump has incomparably more power than any other president in the history of our country. In other words, there’s a real need to follow the aforementioned ‘if you serve at the pleasure of the president, you serve at the pleasure of the president’ rule. For example, President Trump not only has the power to fire Robert Mueller; he also has the legal ability and right to cancel and disband the Supreme Court of the United States as well, should he feel the need for it. And no one could argue with such a decision.”

“This is something that’s necessary in order to cope with the daily problems and disasters that go with the territory of living in a technologically advanced time. To make things perfectly clear once again: this is not something that’s exclusive to just Donald Trump; whoever succeeds him as president will also have a slightly higher level of power, because this power is linked to the position, not the man in the position. It is today a requirement as much as it is a logical order of events. It is important that we evolve with the times and not be stuck in the past while everyone else goes past us. We need to retain the proactively flexible approach to life that has been our trademark for so long. That goes especially for interpreting the Constitution of the United States,” Spicer concluded."
0,http://politicot.com/white-supremacist-lynches-himself-after-learning-of-his-black-ancestry/,politicalo,White Supremacist Lynches Himself after Learning of His Black Ancestry,['Steve Brown'],"STAMFORD, Conn. – After white supremacist Craig Cobb learned that he was 14% black while in front of a live studio audience for the Trisha Goddard Show, he decided to “end the humiliation” by lynching himself, according to members in attendance.

“I didn’t expect that,” said audience member Jon Baker. “Being here I figured we’d be treated to some wacky, Maury Povich-type stuff. But a real-life, up-close hanging? That’s straight out of a Tarantino flick.”

Cobb at first denied the DNA test results linking him to a Sub-Saharan ancestry, referring to the findings as statistical noise. “Wait a minute, wait a minute, hold on, just wait a minute,” said a frantic Cobb. “Do I look black to you?”

But as host Trisha Goddard moved to fist-bump Cobb while exclaiming “Bro!” Cobb reportedly said that he “could feel the blackness suddenly and uncontrollably creeping up inside of [him],” precipitating a fist-bump reciprocation.

“At that moment he realized it was true,” said Baker. “He was undeniably black. But instead of embracing his heritage, he ran from it. I guess it’s all he knew how to do.”

By this point, NBC had already cut to commercial, providing Baker and fellow audience members with an exclusive, front-row seat to the spectacle that was about to ensue—one that no one attempted to stop.

“He’s a white supremacist, which is pretty much the lowest form of humanity,” continued Baker.

“So we kind of just sat there and let him do his thing. First he created a noose from his shirt and then he stepped on to the chair. Then, well – I don’t think I need to explain the rest.”

Not even members of the white enclave that Cobb helped form in Leith, N.D. felt sympathy for their deceased white supremacist leader."

During an interview that aired on Tuesday, Fox News host Brian Kilmeade asked Ryan to respond to a recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report that said there would be 22 million more people without health insurance by 2026 if the Senate’s version of the health care bill is signed into law. “What they are basically saying at the Congressional Budget Office, if you’re not going to force people to buy Obamacare, if you’re not going to force people to buy something they don’t want, then they won’t buy it,” the Speaker opined. “So, it’s not that people are getting pushed off a plan, it’s that people will choose not to buy something that they don’t like or want.”

Kilmeade then asked Ryan to comment on the fact that the Republican health care platform is going to make health insurance plans significantly less affordable by decreasing subsidies for poorer Americans. Ryan replied by ranting about how being poor is “a choice.” “This is something we’ve been over on more than once occasion,” Ryan said. “I know why you’re asking me this; you want me to feel guilty for depriving 22 million people of health insurance, right? Well, I’m sorry Brian, but it’s not working. And the reason why it’s not working is, you’re using the wrong logic here. You’re using the wrong logic alongside millions of other Americans, because all of you feel that those who get up every day and work hard for some reason owe something to those who just lie around doing nothing. That’s not right.”

“Why should anybody who has the willpower to tackle problems and obstacles in order to provide a good life for themselves and their family be obligated to set aside some of their hard earned money to help other people who don’t want to work hard and, instead, rely on policymakers to ensure they have welfare or, in this case, affordable health insurance?” Ryan opined. “The answer is – they shouldn’t. This is a land of opportunities; but, the thing is, to be able to capitalize on those opportunities, one has to be willing to work hard. And that’s the only condition, working hard. If you work your butt off every single day, you can afford whatever you want, including the best health insurance possible. Now we arrive at my ultimate point: if you choose to work hard, if that’s a choice you make every time you wake up in the morning, then this is something that guarantees your success. But, if you choose to be lazy all day and expect the government to take care of you, then you’re doomed.”

“Being rich or poor is a matter of choice; that’s all there is to it. So, let me ask you this, Brian: if 22 million people consciously make the choice to not work hard day in and day out, why on earth should the rest of us be concerned with whether or not they’re going to be healthy? If they choose to be poor, then it’s their own problem if they can’t afford to be healthy. Think of the message we’d be sending to poor people around the world by nurturing laziness and providing affordable healthcare to poor people. We’d be sending them an open invitation to come here and do nothing. ‘Just come on over and become a U.S. citizen – the government will get you free food, free shelter and free health insurance, and you don’t even have to get a job.’ That’s preposterous, anyone who thinks that’s a good thing deserves to be poor,” he concluded."

Trey Gowdy (R-SC), who is taking over the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform from the departing Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), said on Friday that he will not pursue any investigation into Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election. Politico reports that Gowdy told reporters on Friday that he “wants to return the Oversight panel to its original ‘compulsory’ jurisdiction, including overseeing more mundane issues like government procurement and the Census.” Gowdy also ruled out looking into whether Trump White House adviser Jared Kushner’s security clearance should be revoked.

“I really don’t see the need to pursue that kind of activity anymore,” Gowdy told portal KnowMyRepublican.com in an interview. “There’s no use in gutting the federal budget anymore. In the event that that’s not a good enough reason to stop this, I’ve got a whole list of arguments to support my decision, some of the most obvious being the fact that the election is in the past and what’s done is done, as well as that there were no immediate and incriminating evidence to suggest that there was any interference by Russia or any other nation, for that matter. And then there’s also the fact that, if it did happen, which I’m not saying is the case, but if it did, I’m sure they didn’t mean anything by it.”

Asked to elaborate, Gowdy went on to argue, “Look, let’s make this really simple. If you were dying, heaven forbid, and you needed an emergency blood transfusion or something to keep you alive, and a good Samaritan walked in and helped you in your hour of need, would you go on to press charges and launch an investigation into the good Samaritan once you’ve fully recovered? Of course not, you should be grateful for such a merciful and kind act. Trust me when I say that the situation is no different when it comes to the presidential election and Russia’s alleged involvement. For me to continue this charade of trying to accuse and incriminate someone who, if anything, helped this country by making sure Donald Trump was elected president, would be highly ungrateful and would be equal to spitting our savior in the face.”

“This is a new age we’re living in. The time of the Cold War and communism is over, Russia is not our enemy anymore. There are far greater and more deadly threats out there and we’d be wise to reevaluate who our real friends are. What I’m really trying to say is, without beating around the bush, if Russia really did do something to affect the presidential election in 2016, they were only trying to help. For all intents and purposes, they must have thought they were helping America; they shouldn’t be punished for it. If anything, they need to be applauded and congratulated, because – and I’ll say it again – if they really did do something to help Donald Trump become president, they were doing it because they wanted to help this country and not because it suited some personal, selfish end game of theirs. I have faith in our Russian friends, and so should the people of America,” he concluded."

In a candid interview with Forbes, the younger Trump admitted that nepotism got him into a position in his father’s business. But he says his father handed over the management of the Trump Organization to himself and his brother Don Jr. because of their successes. “Nepotism is kind of a factor in life,” Eric claimed. “We might be here because of nepotism, but we’re not still here because of nepotism. You know, if we didn’t do a good job, if we weren’t competent, believe me, we wouldn’t be in this spot.”

“And besides,” he continued, “if we’re being honest, I have to point out that the fact that I’m being asked this question is kind of borderline offensive. I mean, I understand that my father is not your typical president of the country that comes from politics and all that, but I view that as his advantage instead of the other way around. That being said, do you think it’s fair to suggest that I’m incompetent simply because my father is who he is or because I was born as the son of Donald Trump? At the end of the day, you don’t get to pick your family; the only thing you really get to pick in your life is what you do with it.”

President Trump’s heir also said, “On the other hand, I don’t see other children of wealthy families being asked this question, do you? Therefore, the very fact that I’m being indirectly accused of serving as the head of my father’s business simply because I’m his son is rude in my book. And even if that were true – if I was only his son and nothing else – I could very easily run everything he’s worked so hard for into the ground. But, that’s the thing – that would hurt him and nobody else in this country. As a matter of fact, I think it’s about time we stopped insulting my father and started applauding him for the magnificent work he’s been doing since he became president.”

“You want to talk nepotism? How’s this: if I were the average American, which I still think is an awesome thing to be, I would not only support Donald Trump’s work as the president of the country, but I would also encourage him to hire as many of his family members as the leading team of all his companies and enterprises for one very simple reason,” the president’s eldest son revealed. “Donald Trump is a self-made billionaire who managed to become the president of the greatest country in the world, and did it all thanks to his hard work. As an American, that’s the kind of gene pool I’d want running the country 24/7 if you ask me.”

“I think forgiving and, what’s more, encouraging nepotism in the White House as well as the Trump family is the perfect way Americans can repay my father for the awesome pro-bono work he’s been doing as president so-far. Because, let’s not forget: we’re talking about a billionaire here. Being the President of the United States is all fine and dandy, but waking up in the morning and going for a dip in your very own pool of cash is even better. So, pro-bono work is something my dad has gone to great lengths to achieve and he doesn’t mind doing it. Plus, he’s paid a higher tax rate than former president Obama. Combined with the volunteering he’s doing at the White House, I think that’s as charitable as it gets,” Trump’s son concluded."

Robertson—whose show reaches nearly 1 million viewers a day—said that, since 1969, he’s been wearing an “anti-sodomite” necklace, which, according to Robertson, “repels homosexuals and other queers, and keeps [him] free of their abhorrent lifestyles and gay diseases.”

“With all the gayness poisoning our great nation these days, you might think it’s only by God’s grace that I have managed to remain straight and healthy through it all,” Robertson told his viewers. “But, for once, this was no miracle—I have only my gay-repelling necklace to thank, which has kept all sexual degenerates at least 20 feet away from me for the last 44 years, ever since the stonewall riots convinced me the gays were coming for my heterosexuality.”

Robertson neglected to fully explain the necklace’s powers, revealing only that “it involves hyper-masculine materials, such as moose semen and barbed wire,” but said that he is finally ready to share it with the world. “For only ten easy payments of $59.99, you too can protect yourself from fancy-boy, disease spreading homosexuals,” Robertson said. 700 Club producers expect sales of the necklace to generate substantial funds for the show, which netted over $400 million in donations in 2005 alone.

Robertson’s unveiling came as a response to inquiries concerning comments he made on his show earlier this week. On Tuesday, Robertson used a portion of his show to claim that American homosexuals in cities like San Francisco are intentionally spreading AIDS via “specials rings” that “cut your finger” during handshakes and thereby infect you with the deadly HIV virus. “Really,” the host said. “It’s that kind of vicious stuff, which would be the equivalent of murder.”

“Lots of people wrote in to ask how they can protect themselves from these queer, ring-toting murderers,” Robertson said Thursday. “Well, that made me realize I had to come clean about my anti-gay necklace. It’s time for the world to know.”"

After a full week of testimony, Jones claimed the battle with his ex-wife Kelly for custody of their three children is a “private matter.” However, when Mike Cernovich of Alt-Right recently said that Obama is “basically an absentee father” who has “completely abandoned his daughter who is making her rounds through the New York party scene” during a sit-down with the host, Jones jibed that she has been seen “shaking her ass on TV,” before adding, “The word is those aren’t even his kids.”

Luck would have it that merely days later Jones issued the aforementioned statement, asking members of the press to be considerate and respect his privacy. And then he had the audacity to claim the press should “do what I did” and stay away from the low blows. “Look, what a person does is not necessarily who that person is,” he commented following his post. “Just because I’m the founder of a conspiracy website doesn’t mean that’s who I am in my personal life. I don’t see the need for innocent children to suffer the consequences and get dragged through the mud because of the fact that their father is someone who’s used to a similar treatment.”

He continued, “At the end of the day, former President Obama is no longer at the head of the country, for better or worse. I made it a mission to only target him and never anyone close to him, which I think says a lot about the way I do this job. Similarly, I would ask members of the press to follow in my footsteps and shy away from mentioning the names or any private and personal details regarding my children until such time if or when they themselves choose to go public. I think that every parent understands where I’m coming from with this. I don’t mind being crucified by you guys, I’m used to it by now. But steer clear of my kids, because they don’t deserve what I have coming. They didn’t do anything wrong.”

“I never took a cheap shot at former President Obama; sure, there were blows and call outs like with every politician, but I never targeted anything about him just to make him look bad, and that includes his daughters. I know the difference between fair game and low blows. I would even go so far as to say I’ve never said anything that’s not true or even borderline offensive about his family – other than Michelle, of course, but I don’t think even he considers her family anymore, let alone those who never supported him in the first place. She was okay to target, but like I said – one’s children have been, are and always will be off limits, both politically and in every other way imaginable,” Jones dared to argue."

“It was a rare year when the 3-point competition had as much if not more, intrigue heading into it as the dunk contest because of the notable names who were – and weren’t – participating in each. But LaVine left a lasting impression few will forget.

“The 19-year-old Timberwolves rookie scored a perfect 100 in the opening round. He highlighted his scintillating start with a through-the-legs, one-handed reverse slam. He wore a white No. 23 Jordan jersey for what he dubbed the “Space Jam” dunk.

“For his second dunk of the first round, he tossed the ball up, put it behind his back in the air and threw down a powerful one-handed slam for another 50 from Hall of Fame judges Julius Erving, Walt Frazier, Nate Archibald, Bernard King and Chris Mullin.

“LaVine had a final-round 94 to overtake Orlando’s Victor Oladipo, who struggled to convert his first attempt and finished with a 72 in the championship round. LaVine became the first Timberwolves player to win the dunk contest since Isaiah Rider in 1994. He also became the first player with multiple dunks with perfect scores in the same contest since Dwight Howard in 2009.

“LaVine said: “I’m still on cloud nine. I feel like I’m dreaming. Seeing all the dunk contests and people hoisting the trophy, I just saw myself do it and lived it, so it’s a dream come true. I’m glad my family is here to witness it and go through it.”

“I know everybody loves to joke about how white people can’t jump. I mean, there was even a movie made with the exact same name. But, now that we’re welcoming a new champion, I’d just like to say to all those who agree with the aforementioned phrase – well, maybe white people can’t jump, but Jews can sure dunk,” said Adam Silver, the NBA commissioner. “Jews can and will do a whole lot more for this sport.”"
0,http://politicot.com/donald-trump-jr-claims-quebec-shooter-muslim-christians-arent-allowed-kill/,politicalo,Donald Trump Jr. Claims Quebec Shooter Was Muslim Because “Christians Aren’t Allowed To Kill”,['Lea Vat Kens'],"Donald Trump Jr. liked a post on Twitter extolling the “tremendous spike in political capital” his father, President Donald Trump, will receive once “it’s revealed that the Quebec shooting terrorists are Muslims.” The original tweet was posted Monday by John Cardillo, a former NYPD officer and syndicated radio host, who incorrectly posited that the attacker was a Muslim. In fact, 27-year-old Alexandre Bissonnette, the lone suspect in the attack that left six people dead and eight wounded Sunday night, is an anti-Muslim, far-right Trump supporter. Carillo’s tweet links the Sunday night Mosque massacre to Trump’s executive order restricting immigration from several predominantly Muslim countries.

However, in a Tuesday interview with The New York Times, the president’s eldest son argued that the shooter in the Quebec massacre was, in fact, Muslim and that Bissonnette is “being framed.” “I can certainly understand why this is all happening – after all, the political climate is ideal for trying to frame a terrorist attack on a non-Muslim,” Trump Jr. said. He also added that his father’s executive order restricting immigration “was not aimed at Muslims,” but that “unfortunately, that’s what it’s being mistaken for worldwide, and especially in the Middle East.” “As a result, a man is being framed for something he didn’t do. And it’s up to us to shine some light on the matter and make sure that the real culprits are revealed and then punished,” he also said.

Asked to elaborate on whether he has proof that would corroborate his theory in any way, Trump Jr. argued that he’s “sure of it,” because “Christians just aren’t allowed to kill anyone.” “So, you see, it must be that the shooter was a Muslim,” he added. “More precisely – Christians are not allowed to murder anyone. Killing in self-defense and a few other instances is probably okay, though I’m not a man of the church, nor am I a connoisseur when it comes to the Bible, so I can’t really specify what is and isn’t considered a righteous kill, so to speak. But the whole murder thing – yeah, that I’m pretty sure of.”

“On the other hand, if you look at the Muslim world and the Quran, they’ve got the Jihad, the Holy War or whatever it is they’re calling it. So, it’s literally written in their holy scripture that they’re supposed to go after and persecute and murder so-called ‘infidels,’ which is to say non-Muslim individuals,” he asserted. “So, on one hand, you’ve got Christians who are, by default, a peaceful bunch; the whole ‘turn the other cheek’ philosophy and all that. On the other, you’ve got a religion that’s based on exterminating those who don’t agree with it, and they’ve got those orders in writing. How does it happen, then, that the Quebec shooting, which, by the way, happened at a Mosque – a Muslim house of prayer – is being blamed on a non-Muslim?”

“Even a blind person can see that this is a setup, I mean, there are so many movies out there with a similar plot that it’s becoming ridiculous. We ought to be better than this, smarter than this. There is no way in hell the shooter wasn’t Muslim, I’d be willing to stake my life on it. Just take a look at what’s going on in our country for a moment – it’s been almost two weeks since my dad was inaugurated and there haven’t been any racial or religious murders, not one in the whole country. And you want to tell me that has nothing to do with the fact that Barack Hussein Obama, who advocated bringing in more Muslims to America, is no longer president? Come on,” Trump Jr. concluded."

Scott Walker by openly questioning whether President Barack Obama “loves America.”

“The former New York mayor, speaking in front of the 2016 Republican presidential contender and about 60 right-leaning business executives and conservative media types, directly challenged Obama’s patriotism, discussing what he called weak foreign policy decisions and questionable public remarks when confronting terrorists.

““I do not believe, and I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the president loves America,” Giuliani said during the dinner at the 21 Club, a former Prohibition-era speakeasy in midtown Manhattan. “He doesn’t love you. And he doesn’t love me. He wasn’t brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up through love of this country.”

“With Walker sitting just a few seats away, Giuliani continued by saying that “with all our flaws we’re the most exceptional country in the world. I’m looking for a presidential candidate who can express that, do that and carry it out. And if it’s you Scott, I’ll endorse you,” he added. “And if it’s somebody else, I’ll support somebody else.”

“In an interview after the dinner – Walker insisted all of the governor’s comments were off the record – Giuliani said he would “eventually” back a Republican presidential candidate. He also elaborated on his criticism of Obama by arguing the president “sees our weaknesses as footnotes to the great things we’ve done.”

““What country has left so many young men and women dead abroad to save other countries without taking land? This is not the colonial empire that somehow he has in his hand. I’ve never felt that from him. I felt that from [George] W. [Bush]. I felt that from [Bill] Clinton. I felt that from every American president including ones I disagreed with, including [Jimmy] Carter. I don’t feel that from President Obama.”

Asked about his comments in New York, Giuliani told Newslo: “I stand by what I said. I don’t trust that man, I don’t like that man and honestly, I think he’s the worst thing that happened to this country since Pearl Harbor. President Obama doesn’t love America any more than he loves his wife – both of those situations are a no-way-out zone for him. And another thing – I can think of 6,999,999,999 people on this planet who could do a better job as President. I’m just glad to see him go.”"

Giving employers such power is now prohibited by legislation including the 2008 genetic privacy and nondiscrimination law known as GINA. The new bill gets around that landmark law by stating explicitly that GINA and other protections do not apply when genetic tests are part of a “workplace wellness” program. The bill, HR 1313, was approved by a House committee on Wednesday, with all 22 Republicans supporting it and all 17 Democrats opposed.

However, the reason for the bill has less to do with the suspected discrimination of employees based on their genetics, which is to say, ethnicity, and more to do with, apparently, religion. Namely, a source within the committee who requested anonymity, told the Cincinnati Morning Star that the reason why the employer lobby pushed the Republicans into passing the bill was because they were “worried about the religious aspects of their employees’ personal lives, but could not ask them directly, as that would be considered offensive and discriminatory.” Apparently, companies are shifting their focus towards hiring only staff that have a strong connection to their religious side and are God-fearing.

“The moment you have a liberal employee that also happens to be an atheist or something or other, that’s when you know they don’t take their job as seriously as their traditionally-inclined coworkers, which also tends to ruin the work ethic in the office,” the source revealed. “It’s common knowledge that God-fearing workers have an innately different approach to their job; they’re more serious, more hardworking, more productive and, most importantly, are willing to work longer hours compared to their liberal colleagues. All these qualities simply make them the more desirable type of workers to have on the job, especially since everybody’s on about discrimination and equal rights and whatnot these days.”

“Moreover,” the source continued, “there’s also another aspect of God-fearing employees that makes them particularly attractive for companies and businesses. For example, liberal workers also tend to have a disruptive sexual preference and influence on the collective, which can cause a mutiny, let’s put it like that. If you have 9 workers who are God-fearing and traditional and extremely hardworking, and you also have a tenth one who’s an atheist and also happens to be homosexual, that’s something that can very easily bring about a whole lot of problems for you as an employer, and especially for the 9 workers who don’t want to work in that sort of environment.”

“That’s why it’s important for companies to have insight into the results of their employees’ genetic tests, so they can see right off the bat which of them are at the risk of becoming disruptive and disobedient. As an employer, you want a homogenous structure of workers to be handling challenges on a daily basis. If you have one or several of them who keep making waves and pissing off the rest of the guys and you realize you have to fire them for it, you’re at risk of being sued for discrimination, mobbing or whatever. This is just a simple way to avoid getting into a situation like that,” the source concluded."

Speaking to Bryan Fischer, formerly of the American Family Association recently, Carl Kerby insisted it wasn’t infeasible for the giant reptilian creatures to have been on Noah’s Ark.

“The self-described “creation scientist” said he had debunked the notion that two of every animal could not have possibly fit on Noah’s Ark. The Bible states that the boat was about 450 feet long, 75 feet wide and 50 feet high, Kerby explained.

““I see some people that like to mock and ridicule, especially about the dinosaurs, how did they put the big old dinosaurs on there?” he said. “Well, I would suggest to you they didn’t take the big old dinosaur – they would have taken the younger ones.

You think of a guy like me, if you’re going to go repopulate a planet, you’re not taking me with you. My repopulating days are done. You take my son or my grandson. My grandson is a whole lot smaller than I am.”

“Creationists believe that the Flood began approximately 4,359 years ago. Scientists have found that dinosaurs were extinct by the end of the Cretaceous Period about 65 million years ago."

A. You better be here legally or you’re out of here. B. When you’re here, let’s speak American,’” Palin told CNN’s Jake Tapper in an interview that aired on “State of the Union” recently. “I mean, that’s just – let’s speak English and that’s kind of a unifying aspect of a nation – the language that is understood by all.”

“Let me tell you what happened to me the other day while I was in the supermarket,” Palin said during the interview. “I was in there, doing my regular shopping like any other day, and I remember I couldn’t find the type of cereal I normally buy all the time, so I asked the guy who was filling the shelves next to me if he would be kind enough to check whether they had some more in storage out in the back. And that’s when it all started.”

The former half-term Governor of Alaska then went on to tell the story of how pretty soon, the entire supermarket “echoed in the shouts of foreign employees talking to each other in their native language,” and how “I suddenly felt like I was in a completely foreign country.” “I mean, I couldn’t even tell what the language was, it sounded kind of Arabic, but at the same time, it wasn’t. Finally, I was able to get my cereal after 15 or so minutes of this non-English communication, and I left the supermarket in a state of shock.”

“Then I got to thinking – if we have people like these working in our grocery stores, and these people are handling something as important as our food, which is our daily sustenance – what’s to stop them from doing whatever they want to it? I mean, they could be polluting it by mishandling, they could be dropping meat and vegetables on the floor and picking it up and selling it as if nothing had happened. And even worse – they are actually touching all of our food with their hands, and God only knows how or if at all they look after their personal hygiene. I had a real epiphany, I can tell you,” Palin argued.

“Honestly, I’m starting to feel like a minority in my own country,” Palin said. “I’m starting to listen to English being driven out from more and more communities, and foreign languages spoken at an increasing level, especially Arabic and Spanish. Well, it’s time to put our foot down and set things right. This is America, the greatest country in the world and American is the only language that gets to be spoken here. I don’t care what anyone says – either learn it or go back home!”

She also added, “Because, if we let immigrants keep their native cultures, traditions and languages, we’re then allowing them to refuse to become assimilated into the American society. We are, thereby, effectively denying them the very thing that makes an American what they are. And furthermore, you’ve seen the situation we’re faced with in our supermarkets and in many other crucial places and positions throughout our economy and, more importantly, everyday lives. Are we just going to sit idly by and let our culture be usurped?”

“Hell no!” she shouted, before continuing, “and I’m here to tell you that American is the language that everybody in this country is going to have to use 24/7, the way it’s been done for thousands of years on this territory. Even Native Americans today speak our language, and they were, kind of, here before us. Just goes to show you don’t want to mess with Uncle Sam or else Uncle Sam is going to start messing with your native country, and it’s probably going to include nukes of some sort. Just ask Japanese-Americans.”"

No hope!” he also added. But, according to “his son, Tea-Party favorite and Texas Senator, Ted Cruz, Rafael Sr. was “misinterpreted.”

“Lies, all lies,” Ted Cruz told Newslo furiously, and added, “I could never understand what someone would gain by twisting the words of a poor old man.”

However, it would appear that Cruz Jr. is once again caught red-handed, trying to manipulate the public opinion. “Namely, the incident in question took place at an Oklahoma Second Amendment advocacy group in Earslboro, Oklahoma in 2013. Rafael Cruz spoke against secular humanism and atheism, claiming that “the belief systems are two of the main ills facing our society, that they lead to sexual abuse, sexual perversion and a complete loss of hope.”

However, Cruz Sr. didn’t stop there. He added that “people following these two views should be rounded up and placed in special “camps” to keep them separated from the rest of America.”

His son recently spoke exclusively to Newslo and expressed his anger over the fact that “his father’s words were intentionally twisted for the purpose of hurting his [Ted Cruz’s] 2016 presidential run.”

“I can certainly see how someone could easily believe everything that was said about my dad, but the fact to the matter is that he’s an older gentleman and sometimes he slips up when he speaks emotionally. What he actually meant to say was that atheists should be rounded up for camping, not into camps. He meant this as a way to help those poor people find their way in religion on a camping trip, instead of aimlessly and ungratefully spending their days on God’s green earth,” Cruz explained.

He added: “I get angry when I see all kinds of headlines on the internet and press, claiming that my father said this and that; I just don’t get why people do such things to us. It’s the same with me and gay marriage – I’m not even going to comment on that.”

“An avowed creationist and an evangelical preacher in his time, who had claimed in the past that God endorses the death penalty, Cruz Sr. also spoke aloud about evolution being a communist trick aimed at converting people to atheism, that President Obama is a tyrant who needs to go back to Kenya, and that legalizing gay marriage will lead to preachers being arrested for hate speech just for reading the Bible."

Commenting on his fiery statements, the pastor added that “anti-gay camps might not even be enough to contain and annihilate the evil of homosexuality that plagues the Earth.”

“When I really think about it more thoroughly, holding camps and electric fences are a decent enough solution, but they might take too long. Not to mention all that extra time on their hands will give the queers ample opportunity to savor in their blasphemy and sodomy. No, what we really need is something much faster, much more efficient and brutal. Wait a minute,” the pastor shouted, “I got it! Gimme just a sec,” he stated and pulled out his cell phone right in the middle of the interview.

“Hey Chris, how are you doing? How’s everything in New Jersey?” the pastor inquired, leading Newslo’s interviewer to the obvious conclusion that the person on the other side of the line was, in fact, the Governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie. “Say, how’s that women’s Viagra pill deal working out? Uh-huh? That good? And any news on the anti-lesbian vaccine? Great, great. Listen, Chris, I just got a killer idea – have you ever thought about an anti-gay vaccine? I know, sounds epic, right? Look, set the wheels in motion and I’ve got the market and guinea pigs already set up on my end, don’t worry about it. Keep me posted. Talk later.”

After some 2 minutes, the pastor tucked away his cell phone, got back on his seat and with a notable smile on his face said, “Where were we? Ah, yes – methods more efficient than holding camps for gays. Well, you just heard what I’m up to. I really think that an anti-gay vaccine would do the job quite nicely, and I’m not just talking about the short-term effects. No, I think the best thing to do is nip the problem in the bud. Instead of just gays, we’ll administer the vaccine to pregnant women in order to minimize the chances of gay babies being born. That won’t only lead to fewer gays, but it will also result in fewer AIDS cases. I mean, after all, everybody knows that gays are the most responsible for the spike in HIV cases in recent years, especially in the U.S.”

Asked if an anti-gay vaccine would really work considering the ethical issues that are obviously involved, the pastor replied: “Of course it would. It will. It has to. I mean, instead of developing our own brand, we can always import the Russian or Chinese version, but like our problems, I like our solutions to be ‘Made in America’ as well.”"

Palin, 24, said on her blog that Meyer, 26, proposed to her at a Rascal Flatts concert in Las Vegas. “The lead singer, Gary LeVox, dedicated ‘Bless the Broken Road’ to us, and then Dakota got down on one knee and proposed!” she wrote. “It’s amazing to see what happens when you place everything in life in God’s hands.”

“Friends and well-wishers congratulated the couple on the news. As one person said in a comment on Meyer’s Instagram, “This is so ‘MERICA that my mind is blown right now.” Meyer received the nation’s highest military honor for braving enemy fire in 2009 to recover 36 American and Afghan troops in Afghanistan. He was the third living recipient – and the first Marine – to be awarded the Medal of Honor for actions in Iraq and Afghanistan.

“Palin, the oldest daughter of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, has stayed in the public eye since her mother’s failed vice presidential bid through appearances on “Dancing with the Stars” and a Lifetime show about raising her son, “Bristol Palin: Life’s a Tripp.” She also released a best-selling memoir in 2011, “Not Afraid of Life: My Journey So Far.” She was previously engaged to Tripp’s father, Levi Johnston.

“The couple met last year when Meyer visited Alaska to film “Amazing America,” Sarah Palin’s show on Sportsman Channel, Bristol Palin said in her blog post. “He met Tripp during that time, and I’ve seen him in a few places where our paths have crossed since. He’s visited us in Alaska, and I’ve visited his wonderful family in Kentucky,” she wrote. “He’s wonderful with Trip and I’m so proud to be marrying him.” The couple shared news of their engagement on social media. “I’m definitely the luckiest guy ever,” Meyer said in an Instagram of the pair tagged #shesaidyes.

However, Sarah Palin wouldn’t be who she is without a snappy comment or, in this case, interview. She exclusively told Newslo that it is an “honor to welcome a Medal of Honor recipient into the family as a son-in-law, but that things would be even better if he wasn’t a democrat.”

“Truth be told, the idea of Bristol marrying someone who’s not a Republican has never crossed my mind, but she’s a big girl now and I’d like to believe she knows what she’s doing. However, although I sort of have a habit of not getting along with Democrats, I’m willing to make an exception in my daughter’s case,” Palin said. “There are always several ways of looking at things, and I know I should be grateful for her choice of husband. After all, things could have gone differently – I could have ended up with a gay son-in-law, or worse: a gay and a Democrat. Had that happened, I would have been done for.”"

The problem was not in reigniting the American strive to achieve planetary travel or even Trump’s inability to understand Buzz Aldrin’s “Toy Story” quite during his speech. The concern many found was that the president seemed to misunderstand what exactly “space” was. “At some point in the future, we’re going to look back and say how did we do it without space?” Trump asked, as if “space” was one of the scientists on the team. Aldrin’s response was obvious and caught on camera.

Needless to say, the gaffe once again lit up the social media and internet, causing a plethora of comments mocking the president’s inability to hold his own even when it comes to reading a pre-prepared speech. In reaction to the mockery, President Trump lashed out against Aldrin, who made history as being the second man to set foot on the Moon, right after Neil Armstrong. Speaking with portal KnowMyRepublican.com, he said that “it’s a shame people are still having trouble understanding how far fake news go and how long they’ve been around.” He added, “They say I’m ridiculous, but at least I understand what’s going on in this country, unlike some people.”

The president continued, “I had no intention of bringing this up today, but this whole fake news business is really turning into a global conspiracy that’s threatening to set back every single positive thing I’ve done for this country so far. Let me tell you, at first, I was alright with it – as much as one can be alright with something like that – because they were going after me and I’m the president and that’s okay. But it’s only recently that I’ve begun to comprehend the full extent of the lies some people are ready to believe in this country. I’ll also say that, for the greatest country in the world, some of our citizens are pretty gullible. This whole landing on the Moon business is a good example. No way did that happen, especially not back then.”

“If you actually believe we had the technology and resources to send two men to land on the Moon in the 1960s, then you really ought to go and get your head checked out,” Trump added. “It was all fake news, even back then. As a matter of fact, one could say that’s how fake news started in the first place, because the government back then needed something grand to make sure people would continue believing the top political establishment, so they made up the story that these two guys went and walked on the Moon. Let me tell you, if I was the head of NASA, especially back then, there’s a billion other people I’d rather choose for the mission over this Aldrin guy. He’s not a winner, he’s nothing. It’s ridiculous.”

“I mean, he trains all his life to become an astronaut, gets chosen for the epic, historical mission, somehow manages to get up there successfully and then doesn’t have the brass to go out in front of Armstrong and cement his place in history as being the first guy to set foot on the Moon? I mean, come on, that’s idiotic. Every single one of us would have jumped at the chance to do something that monumental and important. And you’re trying to tell me that, not only was he up there, but that he also had the decency and good manners to let someone else go down in history as number 1? You’re telling me he was up there and still willingly agreed to be number 2? And I’m supposed to respect and take insults from that guy, from the number 2? Come on, be serious. There’s no way I’m putting up with that liar. There was no evidence whatsoever that he came close to the Moon, let alone walked on it,” Trump concluded."

Joan Walsh wrote on AlterNet: “Read and decide for yourself if this war on women is imaginary:”

““Democrats didn’t make the GOP presidential field back “personhood” laws that would criminalize some forms of birth control. They didn’t force the newly elected house GOP to make defunding Planned Parenthood their first legislative goal. And they didn’t propose the Blunt Amendment that would have allowed employers to withhold health insurance coverage not only for contraception, but for any treatment they disapproved of.”

Furthermore, it would seem that Cathy McMorris Rogers isn’t the only Republican waging a crusade against her own sex. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, famous for his sharp tongue and conservative political views, seems to have joined McMorris Rogers in their party’s obvious war on women in America.

Christie recently addressed the rumors that pharmaceutical companies are extensively researching a Viagra pill for women. The New Jersey governor allegedly denied that such a pill would have numerous benefits for women in a televised interview and verbally attacked the host for asking him such “offensive and idiotic questions.” When asked to comment on the incident by Newslo, Christie said: “Oh no, I really feel like women could use a Viagra pill. Like we don’t have enough dykes already.”

Asked to elaborate on his offensive language, the anything-but-subtle Republican stated that “the only thing such a pill would do for the women of the world is get them to change their sexual orientation.”

“The men of today already have enough trouble satisfying women as it is. Why do you think Viagra was invented in the first place? But no, let’s amplify women’s sex drive even further, that’ll definitely help them feel more satisfied and relaxed. And who are they going to turn to quench that thirst? Other women. Men aren’t machines, but neither are they. They just haven’t realized it yet,” Christie concluded."

He’s set to embark on his first official trip overseas Friday with pit stops in Saudi Arabia, Israel, Belgium, Italy and the Vatican – something he’s reportedly pouting about, huffing and puffing that the nine-day excursion is far too long. Worse yet: none of the places he’s visiting have a Trump-branded hotel with workers that are duty-bound and practiced at serving him his favorite meals. Trump is a noted lover of fast food: McDonald’s burgers and Kentucky fried chicken are staples. “The Big Macs are great. The Quarter Pounder. It’s great stuff,” he said in a town hall event about his orders from McDonald’s.

However, there might be trouble on the upcoming trip, as a source within the White House leaked information that the president is “reluctant” when it comes to visiting Israel, because he’s not convinced he’ll like the food there. “I wouldn’t say he’s scared, because he doesn’t get scared, he’s not the type. But there’s an apprehensiveness about him whenever anyone from the staff mentions the fact that he’s scheduled to visit the place,” the source, who requested anonymity, told portal KnowMyRepublican.com. “From what I understand, they’ve tried to explain to him several times that he can have anything he wants custom prepared for him and then brought in especially tailored to his requests, but for some reason, he just doesn’t want to hear of it. From what I could gather, the staff are puzzled by this as they didn’t expect it to turn into that big of a problem.”

The source continued, “I recently had a talk about it with someone very close to him, and it seems that the reason why he’s so reluctant to keep Israel on the list of visits is because, as you know, the president is a huge fan of fast food, and he’s particularly fond of McDonald’s. However, because of the cultural and religious differences, the company tailors their restaurants to accommodate the desires of the population in any given region where it conducts business. That’s why, for example, McDonald’s restaurants throughout Europe look nothing like the ones we have here. The same applies to those in Israel; they are literally completely different from any other McDonald’s restaurant – one could even argue that they’re unique. Their ingredients come from different sources and they also have different traditions when it comes to the types of meat they use.”

“Ultimately, my source tells me that the president is even threatening to cancel his visit to Israel because the McDonald’s restaurants there don’t have a bacon cheese Big Mac, which is a favorite of his. He’s apparently demanding the staff to make arrangements to somehow provide them for the duration of his visit. I don’t need to tell you that the staff are very frustrated and worried about not being able to accomplish that. So much so, in fact, that I’m also told they’ve started contacting the McDonald’s headquarters and begging the management to accommodate the president’s request. I am yet to learn of the outcome of that plead, but it gives you an idea of how spoiled Donald Trump really is. At the end of the day, i personally think they’ll figure out a way to make it happen, because everybody knows Donald Trump is not a man you want to disappoint,” the source concluded."

Palin’s latest crusade puts her in the middle of the battle to protect the heart of Christmas. “We were founded as written in our chapters of liberty, in the documents that created America,” Palin said. “We’re founded on a Judeo-Christian faith that would allow forever the right to express or respect for faith in America.” Palin also told CBN News that her book, Good Tidings and Great Joy: Protecting the Heart of Christmas, is a rallying cry for Christians to stand up against those who want to keep faith out of the public square.

Apparently, the Union of Alaskan Prostitutes, an organization dedicated to offering physical protection and legal representation to the working girls of Alaska, agrees with its former half-term governor completely. In accordance with their position on the apparent liberal, corporate war on Christmas in America, the Union has decided to offer a 50% discount to all Republicans as a way of supporting their fight against the destruction of the holiest of Christian holidays. “We thought long and hard about what we could do to help out in the fight against war on Christmas, and since we’ve always been a proactive organization, we came up with this idea on one of our monthly meetings,” Sheila Plumpbottom, the Union’s spokeswoman and former employee, told CBN News.

Plumpbottom also argued that “offering money or other monetary or physical forms of contribution” would not represent an honest mix between the spirit of giving that is Christmas and the Union’s own business, which is why they decided to help out in their own, unique way. “Part of the reason why we went with this type of solution was the fact that there’s a lot of stress going on in today’s world, especially with the technology that’s alienating people and pornography that’s changing everything,” the spokeswoman said, adding that since the premiere of the Apple iPhone in 2007, the Union has recorded a massive decrease in business, which led them to the conclusion that “more and more people have started masturbating at home and watching porn on their smartphones. They couldn’t be bothered anymore to go out and pick up a working girl like they did in the old days,” she deduced.

That’s why the Union has decided to re-brand and offer a special discount coupon to all those interested in hiring their services and supporting Republican politicians’ war on Christmas-haters. “All they have to do is use the coupon with the words ‘whore-on-xmas’ and they’ll pay 50% off the regular price. We’re also thinking about other ways to contribute to the cause, but we’d first like to gauge how well this is going,” Plumpbottom added. “Republican politicians are hard-working, traditional, conservative Americans, and such men and women in today’s times are in the minority compared to liberals who tolerate everything and everyone. We simply want to help Republicans relieve all that stress. Our girls are very talented, drop-dead gorgeous and more than willing to take some of the load, if you know what I mean,” the spokeswoman concluded."

At 4 p.m. sharp, Arpaio and a member of his Sheriff’s Office’s Cold Case Posse had a message for the 40-odd journalists in attendance: You were wrong. Arpaio and his aides announced that a five-year probe had proved that Obama’s birth certificate from Hawaii in 1961 was, in fact, a forgery.

“There are very few new things about this theory, which, as you can see, is not just a theory anymore,” Arpaio told reporters. “We were adamant and we persevered and now we can say with absolute certainty that so-called president Barack Obama’s birth certificate, which he falsely produced in 2011, is in fact, fake. And like I said – there ain’t much new developments there, I’m sure even many of you had their doubts. But, the reason why this is so important is the fact that this confirmation has some pretty big consequences.”

Asked to elaborate, the Maricopa County Sheriff told reporters that this “changes things drastically” in the transition between the President-elect Donald Trump and current President Obama. “And here’s what I mean,” he proceeded to explain. “Since Barack Obama is not a legal citizen of the United States, he does not, according to our Constitution, have the right to run for any political office. Therefore, he should not have been able to run for the presidency back in 2008, and least of all win and become president. I’m sorry to admit it, dear people of America, but we’ve been living a lie for the past 8 years.”

He continued, “And since he should not have been able to do everything aforementioned, the presidency should have, by default, gone to his counter-candidate, which at the time was Sen. John McCain. However and furthermore, since Sen. McCain is too old to assume office right now, and since that would put an enormous strain on his health at this time, I call for Sarah Palin to become acting President of the United States temporarily, until such time when Donald Trump will be inaugurated and assume his full duties as President.”

Asked to explain why he wanted Sarah Palin, the former half-term Alaska governor, to fill in for McCain, Arpaio stated the obvious. “What kind of question is that?” he asked the reporter back. “Do you now know who John McCain’s running mate was back in 2008? Since you obviously don’t, I’ll tell you: it was Sarah Palin. And so it makes sense that we call her and ask her to do her duty for her country. Who else did you expect us to call, Hillary Clinton? The woman lost miserably to Obama for the Democratic nomination back then – a fact that is even more shameful now that it’s clear Barack Obama was a foreign imposter, and quite possibly a Muslim spy. And as if that wasn’t enough, she lost to Donald Trump yet again this November. She doesn’t seem to want to except the huge ‘NO’ Americans keep throwing in her face.”

“And as for the imposter Obama, I move that he be arrested and taken to interrogation to figure out who he’s really working for and who has been ordering him to run the American economy into the ground, allow same-sex marriage and ruin our healthcare. I have a feeling it was either the ragheads, the Chinese or maybe Putin. I don’t think it was the North Koreans, however, since they wouldn’t find sand on a beach, let alone infiltrate a black spy into the U.S. My money’s on the Saudis, because of the religious thing, but we’ll see. I know for a fact President Trump is pro-waterboarding, so it’s just a matter of time,” Arpaio concluded."

Fiorina is reportedly being considered for the role of director of national intelligence. “It was an honor to meet the president-elect,” Fiorina told reporters before praising the “really cool” sports memorabilia in Trump’s office. “I was particularly taken by Shaq O’Neill’s shoe,” she explained. “I guess it takes a champion to know a champion.”

Asked to elaborate on the sudden change in her relationship with the President-elect, she argued that he’s “a man who stops at nothing when it comes to realizing his goals,” but that he also “has no problem communicating with yesterday’s enemies about tomorrow’s opportunities.” “And I’ll be the first one to admit that I stand corrected,” she added. “Donald Trump is a great man by anyone’s standards and there’s no way anyone in their right mind would turn down an opportunity to work with him, especially now.”

The former Hewlett-Packard CEO also argued that, regardless of their past differences, she “doesn’t resent him,” but in fact, has “started celebrating the fact that he is our new President.” “You don’t go hating on the man who has so much in common with a sports giant such as Shaquille O’Neal,” she said. “They’ve both had some rough times and both came out on top of the situation. And what’s more important – both of them beat their respective black mambas. That fact alone proves that Donald Trump is exactly where he’s supposed to be at this time.”

Asked who she’s referring to as the billionaire businessman’s black mamba, Fiorina said, “Do I really need to spell it out for you? It was a figure of speech, but the fact that our former president is of Kenyan descent should have made it pretty obvious. Anyway, if you recall, both O’Neal and Trump were ridiculed by their respective opponents on and off the court. And at the end of it all, both men came out victorious, each in his respective field. So, bottom line, I don’t care how much you hate Donald Trump – you just don’t have any arguments left to hate him. He’s good for this country and you know it.”

“As a matter of fact,” Fiorina continued, “the two are so much alike in some aspects that I’ve wondered if perhaps they share some genes or something. Other than their skin color and ridiculously different shoe size, both Shaquille O’Neal and Donald Trump are basically the same person. They’re winners, they never back down and they’re hugely successful, self-made men. Although, if I were Donald Trump and was thinking about deporting all black people back to Africa, I’d be slightly worried. After all, deporting complete strangers is one thing, but deporting family? That’s a whole other ballpark. Aside from not being very nice, it might cost him his second term,” she concluded."

Three years after Fox’s Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors.

Among many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the company’s actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and “running Mall of America into the ground,” on the basis of Santa “always having been white in the Bible.” “No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,” Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.

She also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was “the last straw” in corporate America’s twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, “because they realized they couldn’t make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques they’ve been using so far.” She added, “That’s why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they won’t shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I don’t understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that.”

“That’s why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again,” Palin added. “The Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we don’t, if we let them get away with it, what’s next? Others will follow their example and the next thing we know, we’re going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights. I mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think that’s happening by accident?”

“Nope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white Christianity. The numbers of converts to Islam have also spiked, just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups. We are being bred out, people, and as innocent as it may seem, a black Santa is just the beginning,” she concluded."

A. You better be here legally or you’re out of here. B. When you’re here, let’s speak American,’” Palin told CNN’s Jake Tapper in an interview that aired on “State of the Union” recently. “I mean, that’s just – let’s speak English and that’s kind of a unifying aspect of a nation – the language that is understood by all.”

“Let me tell you what happened to me the other day while I was in the supermarket,” Palin said during the interview. “I was in there, doing my regular shopping like any other day, and I remember I couldn’t find the type of cereal I normally buy all the time, so I asked the guy who was filling the shelves next to me if he would be kind enough to check whether they had some more in storage out in the back. And that’s when it all started.”

The former half-term Governor of Alaska then went on to tell the story of how pretty soon, the entire supermarket “echoed in the shouts of foreign employees talking to each other in their native language,” and how “I suddenly felt like I was in a completely foreign country.” “I mean, I couldn’t even tell what the language was, it sounded kind of Arabic, but at the same time, it wasn’t. Finally, I was able to get my cereal after 15 or so minutes of this non-English communication, and I left the supermarket in a state of shock.”

“Then I got to thinking – if we have people like these working in our grocery stores, and these people are handling something as important as our food, which is our daily sustenance – what’s to stop them from doing whatever they want to it? I mean, they could be polluting it by mishandling, they could be dropping meat and vegetables on the floor and picking it up and selling it as if nothing had happened. And even worse – they are actually touching all of our food with their hands, and God only knows how or if at all they look after their personal hygiene. I had a real epiphany, I can tell you,” Palin argued.

“Honestly, I’m starting to feel like a minority in my own country,” Palin said. “I’m starting to listen to English being driven out from more and more communities, and foreign languages spoken at an increasing level, especially Arabic and Spanish. Well, it’s time to put our foot down and set things right. This is America, the greatest country in the world and American is the only language that gets to be spoken here. I don’t care what anyone says – either learn it or go back home!”

She also added, “Because, if we let immigrants keep their native cultures, traditions and languages, we’re then allowing them to refuse to become assimilated into the American society. We are, thereby, effectively denying them the very thing that makes an American what they are. And furthermore, you’ve seen the situation we’re faced with in our supermarkets and in many other crucial places and positions throughout our economy and, more importantly, everyday lives. Are we just going to sit idly by and let our culture be usurped?”

“Hell no!” she shouted, before continuing, “and I’m here to tell you that American is the language that everybody in this country is going to have to use 24/7, the way it’s been done for thousands of years on this territory. Even Native Americans today speak our language, and they were, kind of, here before us. Just goes to show you don’t want to mess with Uncle Sam or else Uncle Sam is going to start messing with your native country, and it’s probably going to include nukes of some sort. Just ask Japanese-Americans.”"

No hope!” he also added. But, according to “his son, Tea-Party favorite and Texas Senator, Ted Cruz, Rafael Sr. was “misinterpreted.”

“Lies, all lies,” Ted Cruz told Newslo furiously, and added, “I could never understand what someone would gain by twisting the words of a poor old man.”

However, it would appear that Cruz Jr. is once again caught red-handed, trying to manipulate the public opinion. “Namely, the incident in question took place at an Oklahoma Second Amendment advocacy group in Earslboro, Oklahoma in 2013. Rafael Cruz spoke against secular humanism and atheism, claiming that “the belief systems are two of the main ills facing our society, that they lead to sexual abuse, sexual perversion and a complete loss of hope.”

However, Cruz Sr. didn’t stop there. He added that “people following these two views should be rounded up and placed in special “camps” to keep them separated from the rest of America.”

His son recently spoke exclusively to Newslo and expressed his anger over the fact that “his father’s words were intentionally twisted for the purpose of hurting his [Ted Cruz’s] 2016 presidential run.”

“I can certainly see how someone could easily believe everything that was said about my dad, but the fact to the matter is that he’s an older gentleman and sometimes he slips up when he speaks emotionally. What he actually meant to say was that atheists should be rounded up for camping, not into camps. He meant this as a way to help those poor people find their way in religion on a camping trip, instead of aimlessly and ungratefully spending their days on God’s green earth,” Cruz explained.

He added: “I get angry when I see all kinds of headlines on the internet and press, claiming that my father said this and that; I just don’t get why people do such things to us. It’s the same with me and gay marriage – I’m not even going to comment on that.”

“An avowed creationist and an evangelical preacher in his time, who had claimed in the past that God endorses the death penalty, Cruz Sr. also spoke aloud about evolution being a communist trick aimed at converting people to atheism, that President Obama is a tyrant who needs to go back to Kenya, and that legalizing gay marriage will lead to preachers being arrested for hate speech just for reading the Bible."

“Worley believes that placing gays in camps will ensure homosexuality dies out since gays “don’t reproduce.” Worley isn’t apologizing for his sermon, saying: “We offer NO apologies in believing the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible is the inerrant Word of God. If you live in this area or are ever passing through, I invite you to come visit us at Providence Road Baptist Church.”

Commenting on his fiery statements, the pastor added that “anti-gay camps might not even be enough to contain and annihilate the evil of homosexuality that plagues the Earth.”

“When I really think about it more thoroughly, holding camps and electric fences are a decent enough solution, but they might take too long. Not to mention all that extra time on their hands will give the queers ample opportunity to savor in their blasphemy and sodomy. No, what we really need is something much faster, much more efficient and brutal. Wait a minute,” the pastor shouted, “I got it! Gimme just a sec,” he stated and pulled out his cell phone right in the middle of the interview.

“Hey Chris, how are you doing? How’s everything in New Jersey?” the pastor inquired, leading Newslo’s interviewer to the obvious conclusion that the person on the other side of the line was, in fact, the Governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie. “Say, how’s that women’s Viagra pill deal working out? Uh-huh? That good? And any news on the anti-lesbian vaccine? Great, great. Listen, Chris, I just got a killer idea – have you ever thought about an anti-gay vaccine? I know, sounds epic, right? Look, set the wheels in motion and I’ve got the market and guinea pigs already set up on my end, don’t worry about it. Keep me posted. Talk later.”

After some 2 minutes, the pastor tucked away his cell phone, got back on his seat and with a notable smile on his face said, “Where were we? Ah, yes – methods more efficient than holding camps for gays. Well, you just heard what I’m up to. I really think that an anti-gay vaccine would do the job quite nicely, and I’m not just talking about the short-term effects. No, I think the best thing to do is nip the problem in the bud. Instead of just gays, we’ll administer the vaccine to pregnant women in order to minimize the chances of gay babies being born. That won’t only lead to fewer gays, but it will also result in fewer AIDS cases. I mean, after all, everybody knows that gays are the most responsible for the spike in HIV cases in recent years, especially in the U.S.”

Asked if an anti-gay vaccine would really work considering the ethical issues that are obviously involved, the pastor replied: “Of course it would. It will. It has to. I mean, instead of developing our own brand, we can always import the Russian or Chinese version, but like our problems, I like our solutions to be ‘Made in America’ as well.”"

Palin, 24, said on her blog that Meyer, 26, proposed to her at a Rascal Flatts concert in Las Vegas. “The lead singer, Gary LeVox, dedicated ‘Bless the Broken Road’ to us, and then Dakota got down on one knee and proposed!” she wrote. “It’s amazing to see what happens when you place everything in life in God’s hands.”

“Friends and well-wishers congratulated the couple on the news. As one person said in a comment on Meyer’s Instagram, “This is so ‘MERICA that my mind is blown right now.” Meyer received the nation’s highest military honor for braving enemy fire in 2009 to recover 36 American and Afghan troops in Afghanistan. He was the third living recipient – and the first Marine – to be awarded the Medal of Honor for actions in Iraq and Afghanistan.

“Palin, the oldest daughter of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, has stayed in the public eye since her mother’s failed vice presidential bid through appearances on “Dancing with the Stars” and a Lifetime show about raising her son, “Bristol Palin: Life’s a Tripp.” She also released a best-selling memoir in 2011, “Not Afraid of Life: My Journey So Far.” She was previously engaged to Tripp’s father, Levi Johnston.

“The couple met last year when Meyer visited Alaska to film “Amazing America,” Sarah Palin’s show on Sportsman Channel, Bristol Palin said in her blog post. “He met Tripp during that time, and I’ve seen him in a few places where our paths have crossed since. He’s visited us in Alaska, and I’ve visited his wonderful family in Kentucky,” she wrote. “He’s wonderful with Trip and I’m so proud to be marrying him.” The couple shared news of their engagement on social media. “I’m definitely the luckiest guy ever,” Meyer said in an Instagram of the pair tagged #shesaidyes.

However, Sarah Palin wouldn’t be who she is without a snappy comment or, in this case, interview. She exclusively told Newslo that it is an “honor to welcome a Medal of Honor recipient into the family as a son-in-law, but that things would be even better if he wasn’t a democrat.”

“Truth be told, the idea of Bristol marrying someone who’s not a Republican has never crossed my mind, but she’s a big girl now and I’d like to believe she knows what she’s doing. However, although I sort of have a habit of not getting along with Democrats, I’m willing to make an exception in my daughter’s case,” Palin said. “There are always several ways of looking at things, and I know I should be grateful for her choice of husband. After all, things could have gone differently – I could have ended up with a gay son-in-law, or worse: a gay and a Democrat. Had that happened, I would have been done for.”"

In the Sunday morning tweet storm, Trump attacked the Democratic National Committee, slammed the media and revealed plans to set up a “cyber security unit” with Putin. The Fox News host argued that Trump had to go after the media for incorrectly reporting that 17 intelligence agencies agreed that Russia meddled in the U.S. election. The New York Times has criticized Trump for this claim, noting that it was “misleading and suggests widespread dissent among American intelligence agencies when none has emerged.”

“It was about time the world saw what can be achieved when two of the greatest world powers join forces in order to shut up those who would have them destroy each other,” President Trump said in an interview with portal KnowMyRepublican.com. “We’ve been feuding and arguing for too long. Both the United States of America and the Russian Federation have a long history of power, and it would be foolish of both President Putin and myself to continue ignoring the vast potential that lies ahead if we just manage to put our differences aside and work together for a change. That has been something that was considered impossible for more than 70 years. The possibility of working closely with the Russians has been ignored by a number of my predecessors, including Barack Obama. But, I didn’t get to where I am today by following other peoples’ lead.”

President Trump also argued that America and Russia “alone have the power to end many of the world’s problems.” “I’m talking terrorism, this whole ISIS business, world hunger, the fossil fuel thing, wars, anything that comes to mind, our two countries have the power and resources to end it,” he said. “And that’s why I’ve talked very extensively and thoroughly with President Putin about setting up a cyber security unit that will have the job of protecting the world from hackers and any countries that would like to see the two of us go back to our old ways. He has agreed and I think this is a monumentally important historical precedent. For the first time in several decades, we will be able to again control the world like in the good, old days of the Cold War, when no other country posed a serious threat to us.”

“Basically, the way to move forward is, in this case, to go back to the way things were. Because, it’s just like with political parties – too many of them break up the cake into too many very small pieces. It’s good to have just one – in Russia’s case, communism – or very few – in our case, three – parties that divide the power equally between them. Similarly, when you have just two countries in the world that control everything, peace and prosperity are guaranteed. And that is the way to make America great again; to take back the power that was hoarded like bread crumbs by a number of smaller, insignificant countries in recent years. Everybody thinks they can have nukes today. Well, sorry to say it, but us and the Russians practically invented nukes, and we still have the biggest ones around. Now is not the time to be messing with either of us,” he concluded."

Kushner and Trump were reportedly on their way to a Flywheel class, an upscale indoor cycling club that offer classes for the populist-friendly price of $28 a class. The report, which was featured in Politico’s “Playbook” and picked up by the website Death and Taxes, seems to contradict previous accounts of Trump and Kushner’s commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement. The president’s eldest daughter reportedly pressured Trump to keep the United States’ commitment to the accord prior to his decision to withdraw.

After causing understandable hype in the media, Kushner was asked to comment on the report. He told portal KnowMyRepublican.com, “I really found it funny, I’m not kidding.” He added, “As a matter of fact, I find it hilarious that everybody keeps crying about how the United States of America is the number one invader and creator of conflicts in the world, and yet, at the same time, they’re also running to us every single time there’s a problem they can’t handle. You know, regardless of the fact that I’m close to the man who now happens to serve as President of the United States, I can’t help but feel like this country is nothing more than one gigantic charity organization in the eyes of the world. That is, when we’re not being accused of, how do they put it, ‘installing foreign governments’ and whatnot.”

Kushner also said, “Well, you know what? I’m fed up with catering to what the world wants America to do and ignoring what Americans want America to do. It’s about time we turned away from abiding by so-called international accords that only damage the reputation and wellbeing of our great nation. And when I say great, I mean the greatest. We are literally the richest and most powerful country in the world and we didn’t get there thanks to someone else. It’s our fathers and grandfathers that deserve our gratitude for leaving us this glorious bastion of freedom and wealth. And I don’t think they’d take kindly to us throwing away everything they worked so hard for.”

“To make it perfectly clear – why on Earth should we care about what happens to Paris? It’s a city half way around the world; to make matters worse, it’s in France. We never liked the French and they never liked us back and that’s not going to change any time soon. We’re in the USA and we need to focus on dealing with problems that we have here, not some climate issues, if such exist in the first place, that are plaguing a city in a country we liberated in World War 2, but have hated ever since. Any climate change that happens in and around Paris is France’s problem and our country should have no part in the Paris Climate Agreement. That is the official position of the United States Government, by the way,” he concluded."

But now that the laws have been made public, a closer look revealed that the pope has made it illegal to report sex crimes against children.

According to the new laws, revealing or receiving confidential Vatican information is now punishable by up to two years in prison, while newly defined sex crimes against children carry a sentence of up to twelve years. Because all sex crimes are kept confidential, there is no longer a legal way for Vatican officials to report sex crimes.

“We didn’t mean for this to happen, obviously,” lamented Vatican foreign minister Monsignor Dominique Mamberti. “It’s quite the papal pickle that His Holiness has placed upon our heads. Sex crimes are more illegal than ever, but technically it’s illegal to report them.” Mamberti said that the simultaneous passing of each law is merely a coincidence and insisted that the Church is not trying to protect itself against further embarrassment, but critics outside the Vatican are skeptical.

“They know exactly what they’re doing,” claims Fabrizio Perona of Italy’s La Repubblica newspaper. “They just thought nobody would notice. The Church wants to impress the world by getting tough on sex crimes, but they criminalized leaks, which is the only way anybody would ever discover their crimes. It’s genius, if you stop and think about it.”

Mamberti says plans are already being made to eliminate the loophole, but change often comes slowly to antiquated Vatican law, which is based on the 1889 Italian code. “We’re not going to let a dangerous law like this stand, but people need to understand that this is the Vatican, and there is a process here. Voting, incense, prayer. We ask the minors at risk to please be patient with us.”

Fortunately, only clergy and lay people who live and work in Vatican City are subject to the new legislation, which differs from the canon law governing the universal Catholic Church.

As the Holy See moves to clarify the law, Mamberti has warned would-be offenders within Vatican walls that they “are still subject to the most watchful eye of all: the eye of God. His judgment is greater than—oh, who am I kidding? For now, there is nothing we can do.”"

The Christian owners of Ashers Baking Company were convicted last week after refusing an order from gay rights activist Gareth Lee. He asked for a cake featuring Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie and the words “Support Gay Marriage.”

“Belfast judge Isobel Brownlie ruled that the bakery had discriminated against Lee on grounds of sexual orientation and political beliefs and ordered it to pay 500 pounds ($765) in damages. Members of the McArthur family, the bakery’s owners, said Thursday they would appeal. They said: “We have done nothing wrong as we have discriminated against no individual but rather acted according to what the Bible teaches regarding marriage.”

Speaking exclusively for Newslo on why they made the decision to refuse Mr. Lee’s order when they knew there would likely be legal consequences, the spokesperson for the family said: “It is one thing to be able to compromise on things you’re not okay with, but it’s completely another to go head on against your beliefs.”

The spokesperson added: “You know, the head of the family [who owns the company] told me that he was the one who made the decision and the rest of the members went along with it. He said that he would not be able to live with himself had he accepted the order. The thought of it made him think of sin and he would see it every time he closed his eyes. The man couldn’t sleep at night, so you see, there really was no other way to go about this than to say no.”

“’What kind of an example would I set for other Christians?’ he asked me. I didn’t know what to answer him,” the spokesperson concluded."

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, tore into the US remarks published on his official website and on his Twitter account.

“Khamenei made clear he was neither rejecting nor endorsing the framework deal announced last week. But he challenged the way the US was describing it – specifically, a fact sheet put out by the White House saying sanctions would be removed only after inspectors verify Iran’s compliance.

“The Ayatollah, in one tweet, claimed the fact sheet was “contrary to what was agreed.” In another, he said: “I trust our negotiators, but I’m really worried as the other side is into lying & breaching promises; an example was White House fact sheet.”

“Ever since the preliminary deal was unveiled, Iranian officials have claimed – in their own remarks and fact sheets – that the agreement allows for sanctions to be lifted immediately once a final deal is reached. On Thursday, both the Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and the Ayatollah again insisted that all sanctions be removed as soon as a deal is reached, or implemented.

““We will not sign any agreement, unless all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the first day of the implementation of the deal,” Rouhani said during a ceremony marking Iran’s nuclear technology day, which celebrates the country’s nuclear achievements. During the ceremony, President Rouhani spoke to Newslo exclusively and said that he “has seen some idiotic nations in his day,” but that the Americans are “in the lead big time.”

“I know that politics is a thing of subtlety and I’m also aware that citizens don’t really want to bother with who said what and how someone will respond to what someone else said, but the fact to the matter is the citizens are the ones who vote in the elections and they’re the ones who choose presidents and politicians in power. But how the Americans managed to choose their current leaders is beyond me,” President Rouhani said.

He added: “You would have to be mindless idiots to believe what the American leaders are saying about world politics. Americans are being steered into a war and exploited like cattle and they’re not even aware of it. They may have the money and the technology, but they’re living like slaves. American leaders are lying to their own people and that’s a sad thing to see.”"

But with Iranian-backed rebels now overrunning the US ally tasked with beating back local al-Qaeda affiliates, the nation at the tip of the Arabian Peninsula makes a better case study in the approach’s limitations.

“Yemen was the petri dish for Obama’s concept of how to fight Islamic extremists with a hybrid warfare of US drone strikes, special forces and on-the-ground intelligence provided by local partners. The theory was that, after learning the bloody lessons of protracted ground wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States could no longer bear the cost of inserting its large, vulnerable land armies into hostile Muslim nations.

“Instead, Washington would eliminate terrorists by partnering with friendly governments and forces in regions as diverse as the Persian Gulf, the Levant and Africa in a more sustainable campaign against Islamic extremism. But the success of some of these campaigns is in question, as regional allies have proven too week or disorganized to sustain the anti-terror actions the US is looking for.

“For a while, the partnership with Yemen worked. The local government in concert with the CIA and Special Forces assets on the ground, and a deadly umbrella of drone strikes, pinned down the deadliest franchise left in Osama bin Laden’s empire, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).

“But, Yemen’s instability always threatened to derail the effort and the country’s treacherous tribal and political stew finally boiled over in January when Houthi rebels overthrew President Abd Mansour Hadi, Washington’s latest partner in the capital of Sanaa.

“Obama’s critics argue that the events in Yemen undercut his hands-off approach and leave his anti-terror strategy full of holes. They blame him for abdicating a US leadership role in the Middle East that has spanned multiple presidencies. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who is mulling a run for president, said: “The region is on fire. Leading from behind is not working.”

However, president Obama, in true American spirit, has not given up. In fact, he exclusively revealed to Newslo a part of his plan to both regain US control in Yemen and gain an advantage over Iran in the nuclear talks.

“I’m not really sure how I didn’t come up with this sooner,” he said. “It’s the perfect plan that guarantees the US will once again demonstrate its superior intellect and sense of strategy in the face of its opponent.”

“If the uranium is stored in Yemen, who is practically Iran’s right hand at the moment, we will have forged a long-term solution that will guarantee peace in the region for years to come, not to mention the fact that there will almost be no consequences of radiation; the place is a desert, who will it hurt? It’s like killing two birds with one stone,” the president concluded."

In a candid interview with Forbes, the younger Trump admitted that nepotism got him into a position in his father’s business. But he says his father handed over the management of the Trump Organization to himself and his brother Don Jr. because of their successes. “Nepotism is kind of a factor in life,” Eric claimed. “We might be here because of nepotism, but we’re not still here because of nepotism. You know, if we didn’t do a good job, if we weren’t competent, believe me, we wouldn’t be in this spot.”

“And besides,” he continued, “if we’re being honest, I have to point out that the fact that I’m being asked this question is kind of borderline offensive. I mean, I understand that my father is not your typical president of the country that comes from politics and all that, but I view that as his advantage instead of the other way around. That being said, do you think it’s fair to suggest that I’m incompetent simply because my father is who he is or because I was born as the son of Donald Trump? At the end of the day, you don’t get to pick your family; the only thing you really get to pick in your life is what you do with it.”

President Trump’s heir also said, “On the other hand, I don’t see other children of wealthy families being asked this question, do you? Therefore, the very fact that I’m being indirectly accused of serving as the head of my father’s business simply because I’m his son is rude in my book. And even if that were true – if I was only his son and nothing else – I could very easily run everything he’s worked so hard for into the ground. But, that’s the thing – that would hurt him and nobody else in this country. As a matter of fact, I think it’s about time we stopped insulting my father and started applauding him for the magnificent work he’s been doing since he became president.”

“You want to talk nepotism? How’s this: if I were the average American, which I still think is an awesome thing to be, I would not only support Donald Trump’s work as the president of the country, but I would also encourage him to hire as many of his family members as the leading team of all his companies and enterprises for one very simple reason,” the president’s eldest son revealed. “Donald Trump is a self-made billionaire who managed to become the president of the greatest country in the world, and did it all thanks to his hard work. As an American, that’s the kind of gene pool I’d want running the country 24/7 if you ask me.”

“I think forgiving and, what’s more, encouraging nepotism in the White House as well as the Trump family is the perfect way Americans can repay my father for the awesome pro-bono work he’s been doing as president so-far. Because, let’s not forget: we’re talking about a billionaire here. Being the President of the United States is all fine and dandy, but waking up in the morning and going for a dip in your very own pool of cash is even better. So, pro-bono work is something my dad has gone to great lengths to achieve and he doesn’t mind doing it. Plus, he’s paid a higher tax rate than former president Obama. Combined with the volunteering he’s doing at the White House, I think that’s as charitable as it gets,” Trump’s son concluded."

“I didn’t expect that,” said audience member Jon Baker. “Being here I figured we’d be treated to some wacky, Maury Povich-type stuff. But a real-life, up-close hanging? That’s straight out of a Tarantino flick.”

Cobb at first denied the DNA test results linking him to a Sub-Saharan ancestry, referring to the findings as statistical noise. “Wait a minute, wait a minute, hold on, just wait a minute,” said a frantic Cobb. “Do I look black to you?”

But as host Trisha Goddard moved to fist-bump Cobb while exclaiming “Bro!” Cobb reportedly said that he “could feel the blackness suddenly and uncontrollably creeping up inside of [him],” precipitating a fist-bump reciprocation.

“At that moment he realized it was true,” said Baker. “He was undeniably black. But instead of embracing his heritage, he ran from it. I guess it’s all he knew how to do.”

By this point, NBC had already cut to commercial, providing Baker and fellow audience members with an exclusive, front-row seat to the spectacle that was about to ensue—one that no one attempted to stop.

“He’s a white supremacist, which is pretty much the lowest form of humanity,” continued Baker.

“So we kind of just sat there and let him do his thing. First he created a noose from his shirt and then he stepped on to the chair. Then, well – I don’t think I need to explain the rest.”

Not even members of the white enclave that Cobb helped form in Leith, N.D. felt sympathy for their deceased white supremacist leader."

According to the website, attorney Charles J. Harder is asking that the video, posted by James Hunter, be taken down and that Hunter issue an apology. In a letter from the attorney obtained by TMZ, Harder said that the video implies the 10-year-old is autistic, which the family insists is false.

In an exclusive interview with E! Online, the wife of President-elect Donald Trump also argued that she is considering a lawsuit against “any and all persons who like, share, react to, Tweet, post or further encourage the false claims of Barron’s autism on social media or otherwise.” “I will not tolerate anyone attacking my family, let alone a 10-year-old boy who has wronged no one and has nothing to do with other people’s desire to become famous and popular,” she added. “That’s why this has to stop immediately, and I don’t care how many lawsuits it’s going to take for that to happen.”

“I realized when I first married my husband that I am going to be subjected to far more scrutiny and public interest compared to the attention I was getting when I was a model,” the future First Lady said. “And I came to terms with that because it comes with the territory, you can’t have one without the other. Somewhere in the back of my mind I knew that this sort of thing was likely to happen and I’ve been kind of trying to prepare for it, but to be quite honest – I don’t think anything can really prepare you for someone attacking your child and calling them sick. That’s crossing the line and has to have consequences, legal or otherwise.”

She continued, “Therefore, as of today, I am asking people to stop encouraging the video in question because they too will face a lawsuit because of it. I don’t want to hurt anyone or cause them discomfort, but at the end of the day, I have to react just like every mother should when her child’s safety and wellbeing is brought into question. And in case you’re thinking, ‘You’ll never be able to find all of us because the Internet is a huge place,’ let me just say that my husband is a self-made billionaire who just became the president of this country. How hard do you think it’ll be for him to compile a list for me of everybody that shared the video when I do my thing to him?”

“Oh, and I almost forgot,” Melania added. “In addition to the people who support the false video regarding my son, I am also going to sue anybody who has the audacity to claim that I used to be a porn star. I’ve seen this rumor floating around the Internet some time ago, and I don’t like it one bit. This is an invasion of my privacy and I plan to take full legal action to prevent that from happening again.

The wall, which several previously high-trafficked areas of the U.S.-Mexico border already have – whether an actual wall or a several tiered fencing and integrated technological system – has been a controversial issue to pundits and politicians who lack information on the subject.

However, in a surprising turn of events, several representatives of Mexican drug cartels have come forward recently and, after requesting anonymity for understandable reasons, stated that there will be “no need” to seize their funds in order to pay for the Trump Wall, because, as they claimed, “we are more than willing to give the money to Mr. Trump with which to fund construction if that will guarantee his presidency in November’s presidential election.”

“There is no need for any type of confrontation or escalation of violence, especially now that tensions are so high between law enforcement and civilians, American, Mexican, or otherwise,” one of the representatives said in an interview with a Southern Texas local radio station. “There is no need to go through great lengths to come up with the money as our organizations would be more than happy to help Mr. Trump build his wall should he become president.”

Asked to elaborate on the reason behind their surprising and hard-to-believe statements, one of the cartel spokespersons added that his organization is “relying on the good word of future president Donald Trump about the U.S. stopping its meddling in other countries’ business.” “We believe him to be a man of his word, otherwise, how else would he have gotten to the position of a presidential candidate? He must be a very honest and straightforward man if he’s doing the job that he is,” they said.

“Mexico is struggling enough without having the United States interfering in its internal problems constantly, so we’re hoping this gesture of good faith will prompt Mr. Trump to keep his promise and stop America from running Mexico’s government and politicians like puppets on a string,” the spokesman said. When asked what else the cartels stand to gain from such a deal, things got quite interesting.

“Obviously, leaving Mexico alone is one thing, and it’s very important to us,” he said. “The other thing is that we don’t expect to suffer any major losses when it comes to large shipments of our main product into U.S. territory, because smuggling packages via mules through underground beneath-the-border tunnels is a thing of the past. Nowadays we’re doing it with style. That’s why I’d like to sent a message to Mr. Trump, and that message is that he should feel free to build the wall as high as he wants; our private jets can fly pretty high, too.”

“So, he should really go all out with this one, because, who knows if he’ll ever get another chance like this to build something so monumental using someone else’s money. Although, now that I’ve mentioned it, he IS going to be President of the United States, so I guess he’ll be wasting Americans’ money on all kinds of business endeavors. Well, you can’t win ‘em all,” the spokesperson said with a grin."

He’s unsurprisingly not alone in that thinking. Golden State coach Steve Kerr has called Donald Trump’s policies un-American. Stephen Curry essentially called the American president an a*s. David West said Trump’s approach is the opposite of what the forward teaches youth. But this level of unified decision-making was still somewhat surprising to see after the Warriors clinched the 2017 NBA title. This isn’t the first time players faced that conflict – participating in a photo op with someone whose policies and rhetoric you find reprehensible vs. respecting the office of the presidency – though, they have usually sided with respecting the office and getting the experience of a lifetime.

Meanwhile, counselor to U.S. President, Kellyanne Conway is at it again. In an interview with Minnesota’s KYSP Radio, she argued that the news of the Warriors’ refusal to visit the White House in a celebratory fashion is “a disrespectful act” and something you just don’t turn down. “First of all, I have to mention that I was going to congratulate the team for their win, but then I realized I’d be acting against my position by doing so. That’s the first thing. The second thing, I mean, I understand that everyone has the right to free will and all that, but everybody knows that an invite to visit the White House is a privilege not many are granted. It’s just one of those things you don’t turn down. So, to do something like this, and publicly, it’s a scandal,” she said.

She continued, “One could almost say it’s a rule. As a matter of fact, you know something? I’m just going to go out there and say it: it’s a law. And though I know it’s not really a law, I’m going to make sure to make it one. Because, it’s not about who the president is; the guy’s in there only temporarily. It’s about the structure, the space, the history within it and, ultimately, the honor of being inside a place where so many decisions took place; decisions that shaped the world as we know it. Ugh, I’m getting goosebumps just thinking about it. I can’t even begin to describe how I felt when I visited it for the first time. The Warriors don’t realize it yet, but they’re looking at this all wrong.”

“That’s exactly why I plan to do everything in my power to make sure Golden State is prohibited from winning the championship, formally speaking, unless they agree to come and celebrate in the White House. That’s the rule – or the law, whichever one you prefer – because I refuse to let this privilege be smeared by a group of so-called athletes who are such prima donnas that they can’t fathom being a part of something greater than their own puny achievements. Winning the NBA is done by a different team every year; but, there’s only one White House. That’s the gameplay, fellas. I hope I made it clear enough for you,” she concluded."

LeBron James has made it clear to his fans, and to Donald Sterling, LA Clippers owner, that he will not be forced to play basketball, until his demands are met.

LeBron, an NBA superstar talents seems to go outside the realms of basket. He is quite a negotiator. LeBron James wants the lead role in the sequel “Space Jam’, the remake if it is ever to be remade, and he insists that the Milwaukee Bucks, who had a really sad season be reclassified as a high school team.

Fans would think that this is enough “blackmail” demands even for a superstar like LeBron; but, this is just the beginning. He has the power, and he is holding the world hostage with even more demands.

The NBA have until next season to dump Sterling for the racist remarks he made, or lose one of the best basketball players since Michael Jordan."
0,http://politicalo.com/gop-rep-isis-will-force-nfl-play-burqas-dont-act/,politicalo,GOP Rep.: ‘ISIS Will Force the NFL to Play in Burqas If We Don't Act’,['Maxwell Cohn'],"HOUSTON—Representative Ted Poe, R-Texas, warned the Obama administration Wednesday that “ISIS will force the NFL to wear burqas and other forms of Islamic dress if we don’t act immediately.

“ISIS’s inevitable takeover of the NFL is a horrific vision. Burqas provide no head or body protection whatsoever. And by dressing all teams identically, ISIS will make it extremely difficult for NFL players to distinguish between their team members and opponents. How we will determine the true winner of this year’s Superbowl!” Mr. Poe added.

While ISIS has not specifically threatened to dress NFL players in Islamic garb during their violent messages to America, Mr. Poe sees redecorating the NFL as “ISIS’s most obvious next move.”

Prior to his address about ISIS’s NFL burqa Armageddon, Poe alerted the American people that ISIS could infiltrate the United States across the southern border. Poe predicts ISIS will call upon Mexican drug cartels to traffic terrorists into America, thus advising President Obama to strengthen security at the U.S.-Mexico border, not only as means to prevent illegal aliens from entering, but as a weapon for thwarting ISIS’s next act of terror against the NFL.

Poe’s premonition that ISIS will seep into America has been further validated by Gary Painter, sheriff of Midland County, Texas, who reported finding Qurans, Islamic clothing, and sketches of Dallas Cowboys players wearing full-length burqas scattered along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Senator Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has seconded these concerns, stating that President Obama “needs to rise to the occasion before we all get killed back here at home, before ISIS covertly enters NFL locker rooms across America and sends our athletes out onto the field dressed in burqas, which aren’t even supposed to be worn by men in the first place.”"

He’s Just A Man”,['Lea Vat Kens'],"Fox News host Sean Hannity prepared his audience for yet another woman coming forward with accusations of sexual assault against Donald Trump, insisting the newest charge against the Republican presidential candidate is “going nowhere.” “I told you there was going to be some bomb this week,” Hannity said Wednesday on the Sean Hannity Show. “There’s this woman that had claimed that Donald Trump raped her when she was thirteen years old and is going to break her silence on Wednesday afternoon,” Hannity said. “So that’s the one they’ve been holding back on.”

“And here’s the key thing I personally have a problem with here,” he added. “Imagine you’re a Democrat, right. You’re a liberal and your sole objective from the moment you wake up in the morning till the moment you go back to bed at night is figuring out how to take down Donald Trump. And trust me, there are people like that all over the place, it’s incredible. Anyway, that’s all you think about, 24/7. And after you’ve tried every possible trick in the book – and have taken advantage of Trump’s own incidents against him – you realize he’s just too tough of a nut to crack, right. So, what do you do next?”

He continued, “Well, you start thinking outside the box. And since you’ve already exhausted every child molester, serial rapist, misogynist, bigoted and every other angle you could think of, you’re down to one option. You come up with this idea to pay some random 13-year-old girl a handsome amount of money to accuse Donald Trump of raping her. Now, we’re talking here about a guy who’s had so many girls and women in his life he doesn’t remember 99% of them. And naturally, when a cute, little 13-year-old girl asks him if he remembers raping her, he’s going to go with ‘I don’t think so, but I’m not sure.’”

“So, your plan is working like a charm up until this point,” Hannity said. “Now it’s time to get everybody on Trump’s case and take him down once and for all. But, here’s why that won’t work either – you paid an underage girl to lie and accuse an innocent man of rape, and then you want to convince the public that he should be blamed for it? Basically, your goal is to blame a billionaire for raping a 13-year-old girl he never even met? This is Donald Trump we’re talking about here – he could have small girls by the bucket loads waiting for him anytime, anywhere, including importing foreign ones from abroad. They’re much easier to work with because, after all, they don’t fight back as hard as our girls.”

“But, anyway – great plan, genius, it’s really fail-proof. And you know what the best part of it is? You’re putting all your money on the public condemning a man for falling for the spell of a woman, or in this case, young girl. How would you expect him to react? ‘Hey, here’s a young girl who’s DTF, but I think I’ll sit this one out?’ Yeah – said no man ever. No normal male would ever turn down free sex, and yes, dear ladies – that also goes for those snot-nosed, geek types of men you have doing your choirs at home. If it’s a tight hole and it’s attached to two legs, preferably belonging to a female homo sapiens, us guys are good to go. And trust me, Donald Trump is no different in that regard,” Hannity concluded."

Rushmore “As One Of The Founding Fathers”,['Lea Vat Kens'],"“There are many ways to describe South Dakota’s way of attracting millennials, and one of them is to refer to it as “out of this world.” Namely, in an attempt to re-brand the state, South Dakota’s government – with the help of a marketing firm – has launched a new ad campaign with a simple, albeit bizarre message: “Moving here is better than moving to Mars.”

““Mars. The air not breathable. The surface: cold and barren,” the commercial begins. “But thousands are lining up for a chance to go there and never come back. But wait just a minute, would-be Mars rovers. Have you considered South Dakota?” The narrator makes the pitch: “South Dakota. Progressive. Productive. And abundant in oxygen. Why die on Mars when you can live in South Dakota?”

“While the ad is raising eyebrows, the Argus Leader detailed the painstaking process that went into this approach. The goal of the Governor’s office of Economic Development was to attract young people to a place deemed “boring.” Commissioner Pat Costello said the “hook works” with the younger generation, whom they are trying to attract.

“Costello told the newspaper: “You can live a life here. You can have fun here. You can have a great job and go fishing and biking and hiking. The opportunities are abundant.” And then he whipped out the ad-reference: “And hey – it really is way better than Mars.”

However, it would seem that politicians aren’t just focused on the 2016 presidential elections. One of the most conservative Republicans out there at the moment, Scott Walker, Gov. of Wisconsin, apparently caught sight of the peculiar advertisement and expressed his support and personal view on the matter in an exclusive interview with Newslo.

“I am well aware that people think I’m utterly conservative. But you know what? I don’t have a problem with that, not at all,” Walker stated. “In fact, one of the most conservative, and at the same time, impressive architectural features in the world is in South Dakota and the state’s government does it justice by trying to attract more people. Mt. Rushmore is a feature unlike any other I know about, and it’s synonymous with the state of South Dakota.”

He continued: “However, I do feel that Mt. Rushmore can be improved and left to the coming generations in a more glorious state than it was left for us by our predecessors. In addition to the founding fathers of this great nation, I think that carving the face of Jesus Christ into the rock would only amplify the significance of that great monument for all true Americans, since Jesus himself was also a founding father. I truly believe that it would help sway the misguided youth of this country onto their right and honorable path.”

Walker concluded by adding: “Not to mention it would do wonders for South Dakota’s tourism revenues.”"

“Fiorina told reporters at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast: “I think that if Hillary Clinton were to face a female nominee, there are a whole set of things that she won’t be able to talk about. She won’t be able to talk about being the first woman president. She won’t be able to talk about a war on women without being challenged. She won’t be able to play the gender card.”

“Fiorina said in a female vs. female presidential match-up, Clinton would have to run on “her track record, her accomplishments, her candor and trustworthiness and her policies.” She continued: “And I think that’s what elections should be run on – not identity politics, not what you look like, but who you are, and what you believe, and what you’ve done, and what you will do.”

“The former Hewlett-Packard CEO is publicly undecided on whether to run for president, but she’s been making preparations for a campaign, traveling to early primary states to gauge interest in a potential bid. This week she’ll be in New Hampshire with the rest of the potential and announced GOP presidential contenders for the Republican leadership summit, hosted by the New Hampshire Republican Party.

“She’s been an outspoken critic of Clinton since the Democrat launched her campaign this last weekend, charging Tuesday that Clinton “lacks accomplishment” and knocking her on equal pay for women on Facebook. But Fiorina argued Thursday that aside from her gender, her business experience made her uniquely qualified for the presidency. “I’m not a neophyte in government, but I’m not a professional politician,” she said. She later added: “I understand how the world works.”

In an exclusive interview with Newslo, Fiorina stated that “Clinton is known to be well-prepared for every public appearance in her schedule,” but that “she’d have a hard time preparing for a debate with another female.”

“Everybody loves a girl-on-girl fight, that’s no secret,” Fiorina pointed out. “I can’t tell you which of the two of us would win, but I can say she’d definitely have her hands full with me. My unique business experience puts me in a position to view things from another, more professional angle, and that’s something she’ll never have. She just hasn’t done enough for this country to be worthy of presidency.”

And then, the gloves finally came off: “Who am I kidding? I would totally obliterate her in a debate. There is just too much at stake.”"

The new requests are being made by Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, following revelations that both women used a private internet service and email accounts for State Department correspondence.

“Grassley says that the earlier requests to the department have been largely ignored, so the new ones have gone to the department’s inspector general and to Secretary of State John Kerry, seeking their involvement. Grassley’s probe started in 2013, when he requested all communications between Abedin, after she switched from a full-time deputy chief of staff for Clinton to a part-timer, then started working for Teneo, a consulting firm that says it “brings together the disciplines of government and public affairs.”

“A July 2013 letter from the department to Grassley, provided by the senator’s office, states Abedin worked full-time from January 2009 to June 2012. It also states Abedin did not list outside employment upon ending her full-time employment and that the department retained her as an adviser-expert at the hourly rate of a SGA GS-15/10. The most recent available federal documents show the rate as $74.51 with a maximum pay of $155,500 annually.

“The letter to department Inspector General Steve Linick also questions whether the department’s “excessive” use of SGE designations undermines ethics standards and if Abedin and Clinton’s private emails have the potential to impede the department from fulfilling Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, requests, over which the upper chamber’s Judiciary Committee has legislative jurisdiction.

Oddly enough, when asked by Newslo to comment on her assistant and their emails, Clinton, who is known for having a sharp tongue in almost every occasion, refused to do so. The former Secretary of State kept quiet even when Newslo’s reporter continued to insist with the question. However, she did finally comment, and rather angrily, on the question of whether her silence was to be taken as a sign of something more between the former First Lady and her mysterious assistant.

Clinton said: “How dare you ask me such a question? I most certainly did not have sexual relations with that woman. Mine and Huma Abedin’s relationship is strictly professional and I don’t know where you get such ideas. Oh, wait a minute…have you been talking to my husband? Never mind,” she concluded and left in a hurry."

The White House, clearly angered by an address criticizing its Iran deal-making, denied Netanyahu an Oval Office meeting during the visit. The reason, according to an official statement, was to “avoid the appearance of influencing a democratic election in a foreign country.”

“Snubbing an Israeli prime minister, though, can influence Israeli voters as much as giving him a West Wing photo-op. And with US-Israel tensions at a peak, many in Washington see telltale signs of an effort to oust a leader standing in the way of Obama administration’s Middle East policies.

“A senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, David Weinberg, who has studied American influence in Israeli elections, said: “This election cycle in Israel fits the hallmark of an American administration that seeks to influence the outcome.” The White House denied it was attempting to influence the Israeli elections by rebuffing Netanyahu and pointed to the well-circulated statement on why the prime minister wasn’t offered a meeting: “As a matter of principle and long-standing practice, we do not see heads of state or candidates in close proximity to their elections.”

“But such visits – or the lack thereof – have historically been one of the diplomatic weapons US administrations have deployed to sway the Israeli public. Previous presidents have bristled at the hawkish, unflinching posture – especially when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process – that Netanyahu and other Likud party leaders have often struck. But the current antagonism, exacerbated by the speech, has become particularly personal.

“On the other hand, when Republican House Speaker John Boehner extended the invitation to Netanyahu, many jumped on the House leader for helping the prime minister politically. This week, footage of Netanyahu being warmly received on Capitol Hill made it into a campaign ad. The bipartisan nature of the invitation and the fact that it was done without White House coordination – Boehner is a chief Obama rival and disagrees emphatically with his Iran policy – heightened Democratic pique over Netanyahu’s appearance.

However, when Newslo spoke to “Reuven Y. Hazan, the chairman of the political science department at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, on the topic of the Israeli election, he stated that: “the question is not whether Netanyahu will win or lose the election; it’s whether the Democrats or Republicans will.”

““Netanyahu’s speech in Washington was not to save Israel but to save himself; he should have stayed at home and addressed the concerns that trouble most Israelis,” Hazan told Newslo. “The Israeli are a very clever people; we had to be in order to survive in this world. And no one is blind. Even though it’s not being said out loud, everyone’s aware that Netanyahu is just a pawn in the political crusade between the GOP and Democrats. That’s precisely why his tunnel-vision view on things isn’t helping anyone. So, instead of focusing on Netanyahu, the world should be observing the Israeli election as a vote for either the GOP or Obama.”"

As far as the people that were injured, it’s an absolute shame. You just want them to recover. Fortunately, the guy was a really bad shot…liberals can’t even shoot straight.” On Wednesday, gunman James Hodgkinson opened fire on a group of Republican congressmen and their aides who were practicing for a charity baseball match against Democrats. Five people were injured and Hodgkinson was killed by police. He was a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and was feverishly devoted to liberal and progressive causes.

“Now, my life story is, admittedly, not one you encounter every day,” Jenner continued. “I’ve had quite an eventful existence, riddled with both ups and downs and I am grateful to be in this position right now. However, the thing I’m even more grateful for is the fact that I’m a Republican and that I’m supporting the right group of people in this country. Republicans are the best thing to happen to America in the last 50 years by far. On the other hand, we also have the liberals, Democrats or whatever you want to call them. Here’s the thing – everybody who’s blessed enough to be born in this country enjoys the most beautiful thing a human being can enjoy in their life and that’s freedom. That freedom has to do with everything, but most importantly, it has to do with choice. The freedom of choice is what really makes this country great.”

Jenner also said, “But, the thing that bothers me about the liberals is, they purport to want to give the citizens of this country a right to choose, yet they can’t make the right choice themselves. The first wrong choice a liberal makes in their life is, well, to become a liberal. The second wrong choice they make is the choice to lie to the American people. Take their supposed support to gay and transgender people, for example. They make that a staple of their campaign, their creed, and then one of their supporters goes out and tries to kill Republicans during a baseball practice. To make matters worse, he can’t even shoot straight, like I said. As a matter of fact, no liberal can shoot straight. And you know what that means: if they can’t shoot straight, well, the only option they’re left with is to shoot gays.”

“In reality, what this recent tragedy has shown us is the very thing the liberals have been trying to keep secret since the day they were founded. They do not support the freedom of choice, they do not support multiculturalism, they do not support anything that has to do with any sort of liberty – they’re basically communists in disguise. And above all, they hate gays and transgender people – I should know, we’re born with a radar for people like that. That’s why I feel sorry for every single LGBTQ person in this country that voted for Hillary Clinton in the last presidential election, as well as in any type of election ever. You’ve been lied to and you need to come around as soon as possible, because we’re going to be the targeted in the incidents to come. And trust me – there will be more and more shootings because liberals have started losing their grip of reality and it’s beginning to show,” she concluded."

Giving employers such power is now prohibited by legislation including the 2008 genetic privacy and nondiscrimination law known as GINA. The new bill gets around that landmark law by stating explicitly that GINA and other protections do not apply when genetic tests are part of a “workplace wellness” program. The bill, HR 1313, was approved by a House committee on Wednesday, with all 22 Republicans supporting it and all 17 Democrats opposed.

However, the reason for the bill has less to do with the suspected discrimination of employees based on their genetics, which is to say, ethnicity, and more to do with, apparently, religion. Namely, a source within the committee who requested anonymity, told the Cincinnati Morning Star that the reason why the employer lobby pushed the Republicans into passing the bill was because they were “worried about the religious aspects of their employees’ personal lives, but could not ask them directly, as that would be considered offensive and discriminatory.” Apparently, companies are shifting their focus towards hiring only staff that have a strong connection to their religious side and are God-fearing.

“The moment you have a liberal employee that also happens to be an atheist or something or other, that’s when you know they don’t take their job as seriously as their traditionally-inclined coworkers, which also tends to ruin the work ethic in the office,” the source revealed. “It’s common knowledge that God-fearing workers have an innately different approach to their job; they’re more serious, more hardworking, more productive and, most importantly, are willing to work longer hours compared to their liberal colleagues. All these qualities simply make them the more desirable type of workers to have on the job, especially since everybody’s on about discrimination and equal rights and whatnot these days.”

“Moreover,” the source continued, “there’s also another aspect of God-fearing employees that makes them particularly attractive for companies and businesses. For example, liberal workers also tend to have a disruptive sexual preference and influence on the collective, which can cause a mutiny, let’s put it like that. If you have 9 workers who are God-fearing and traditional and extremely hardworking, and you also have a tenth one who’s an atheist and also happens to be homosexual, that’s something that can very easily bring about a whole lot of problems for you as an employer, and especially for the 9 workers who don’t want to work in that sort of environment.”

“That’s why it’s important for companies to have insight into the results of their employees’ genetic tests, so they can see right off the bat which of them are at the risk of becoming disruptive and disobedient. As an employer, you want a homogenous structure of workers to be handling challenges on a daily basis. If you have one or several of them who keep making waves and pissing off the rest of the guys and you realize you have to fire them for it, you’re at risk of being sued for discrimination, mobbing or whatever. This is just a simple way to avoid getting into a situation like that,” the source concluded."

He opined that “allowing each country in the world to have a nuclear weapon” is “right now the best way of ensuring such equality.”

Asked about why he feels that way, the real estate magnate mentioned the Umpqua Community College mass shooting in Oregon, which took place in early October, saying that “lives would have been saved if more people had guns at that college.” “I can make the case that if there were guns in that room other than [the shooter’s], fewer people would have died. Fewer people would have been so horribly injured.”

“And the same logic can be applied to the bigger picture. I mean, right now you’ve got a situation where there’s terrorism and where people are scared to walk the streets of their neighborhoods because they fear a suicide bomber might blow himself up right next to them. And we’ve got to ask ourselves, ‘Why is this happening?’ ‘What motivates these people to take their own lives in such a way?’ And it’s not about idealism or religion, I don’t believe that. It has to do with jealousy, and that comes from inequality,” Trump opined.

He continued: “Why do you think so many people want to become Americans? Because this is the greatest country in the world and because people are drawn to us like flies to honey. And some of them choose to take the easy way out and migrate, while others are forced to stay behind in third world countries. That causes discontent, those people aren’t happy. So, that’s where we need to look for answers. And I think nuclear weapons are the answer we’ve been looking for for a long time.”

Trump then brought forth a theory that “giving a nuclear warhead to every country in the world would make them feel more important and more significant on the world political stage, which would result in fewer actual confrontations and wars.” “I’m not talking about a new arms race; I’m talking about a more equal distribution of power,” he added. “A distribution of power that could end wars, not start them.”

He also said, “And I also believe that would be a great way to get rid of some of the more antiquated nuclear weaponry our country has been having trouble maintaining. This would easily solve that problem. Then, a person in the audience asked, “But, wouldn’t that weaken us as a country and increase our enemies’ destructive potential?”

Trump slightly smiled and replied, “You clearly weren’t listening. I said we should encourage a MORE equal distribution of power, not a COMPLETELY equal one. We’d still keep the best stuff for ourselves. Or, in the words of the great Henry Ford, ‘Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black.’ I think that explains everything.”"

We Never Cared About The Truth”",['Marry-Ann Michaelson'],"“NBC News recently celebrated Brian Williams’ 10 years as anchor of “NBC Nightly News” with a promotional campaign that stressed trust and experience. Now he is in a fight for his journalistic life.

“Williams’ false statements regarding his accounts of his trip on a military helicopter during the 2003 invasion of Iraq have triggered an internal investigation at NBC News into the anchor’s versions of his story. The tale has come under attack from Iraq war veterans and spurred a growing chorus from media critics who say his job may be on the line.

“A journalism professor at USC’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and a former broadcast news reporter, Judy Muller, said: “if you are a journalist, your basic job description is reporting the truth, so if you are caught telling a lie – intentional or not – your credibility is going to be seriously impaired. At the very least, in the age of instant judgment, you will be Twittered into a punch line.”

“Williams has said in recent years that he was in a Chinook helicopter that was forced down by a grenade and small-arms fire, even though his original 2003 reporting said it was another helicopter in the formation that was hit. Crew members in the 159th Aviation Regiment who were on the mission disputed Williams’ account to Stars and Stripes. Williams apologized earlier this week, and he told Stars and Stripes he did not know what caused him to “conflate one aircraft with another.”

“NBC News has assigned the head of its own investigative unit to look into the statements made by Williams. Richard Esposito, a former editor at the New York Daily News now at NBC, will head the investigation. The incident has ballooned into a full-blown crisis for NBC and Williams, whose “Nightly News” is the top-rated evening news program.

Williams exclusively told Newslo: “I have made several public apologies for my earlier statements, but I just don’t know what else people want me to do? If I had the power to turn back time, believe me, I would! I would go back and make sure I never say those words, but they’re out there and I can’t take them back.”

He added: “anyway, it’s not like I’ve done much damage. It’s the freakin’ NBC, we’ve never been about the truth. As long as the dollars kept rolling in, we would have been happy reporting even Jesus’ second coming.”"

In a private session with lawmakers, the king showed an extraordinary measure of anger – anger which he expressed by citing American movie icon Clint Eastwood.

“Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter Jr., a Marine Corps veteran of two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan, who was in the meeting with the king, said: “he said there is going to be retribution like ISIS hasn’t seen. He mentioned ‘Unforgiven’ and he mentioned Clint Eastwood, and he actually quoted a part of the movie.”

“Hunter would not say which part of “Unforgiven” the king quoted, but noted it was where Eastwood’s character describes how he is going to deliver his retribution. There is a scene in the picture in which Eastwood’s character, William Munny, says, “any man I see out there, I’m gonna kill him. Any son of a bitch takes a shot at me, I’m not only going to kill him, I’m going to kill his wife and all his friends and burn his damn house down.”

“Hunter said of King Abdullah: “he’s angry. They’re starting more sorties tomorrow than they’ve ever had. They’re starting tomorrow. And he said, ‘the only problem we’re going to have is running out of fuel and bullets.’”

““He’s ready to get it on,” Hunter added. “He really is. It reminded me of how we were after 9/11. We were ready to give it to them.”

Speaking exclusively for Newslo, King Abdullah said: “yes, of course I’m mad! Wouldn’t you be?! That’s why I decided to consult one of the toughest men I know and a guy I personally look up to. Clint’s experience in the Wild West is extensive and I’ve decided to offer him an exclusive contract to act as my consultant for the time being. Until this crisis is over, I think it’s best to have Clint by my side 24/7. No ISIS member would dare mess with him. Not if they feel lucky, the punks.”"

Tom Reed Suggests Increasing Military Budget “So The Poor Can Feel Safe And Stop Stealing Our Money For Their Health”,['Lea Vat Kens'],"Rep. Tom Reed (R-NY), like many of his GOP colleagues in the House and Senate, faced angry crowds at his most recent town hall. But unlike his colleagues, Reed managed to put his foot in his mouth when it came to the biggest issue at hand: healthcare. According to local news station WHEC, Reed said that he believes “healthcare and health insurance are two separate things” – a comment made to a crowd already angry about his vote to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. “You made your decision in spite of your constituents,” a voter said to Reed during the town hall. “And not based upon what your constituents need.”

In an interview with portal KnowMyRepublican.com, Reed argued that, despite what Americans may think about Obamacare, “it is not a good enough healthcare system.” “I know the bigger picture keeps eluding folks because it takes quite a bit of brain power to process everything that’s going on here, but let me try to paint the picture for you just a bit,” he said. “The reason why everybody’s so upset that we’re trying to replace the Affordable Care Act is because they think that whatever we come up with instead is going to cost them a lot more money. The truth is, there’s two ways of looking at it: there’s what it looks like on the receiving end of the program, and then there’s the providing end. In short, people think Obamacare is good because they get free or cheap health insurance. But they don’t see how much it bleeds the budget on the other end.”

He continued, “Now, I certainly understand the need to be concerned about these things. After all, I’m a citizen of this country too and I am faced with the same problems as everybody else. But the simple fact is, if we don’t do this, if we don’t replace the Affordable Care Act with something cheaper, it is going to end up ruining the budget and we’ll be faced with another economic recession. But, that’s not all there is to it. You see, of course we care about the people of America. We’re not just going to leave them high and dry. Now, what I’m suggesting – and what everybody seems to have a hard time understanding – is, yes, we make the new healthcare system a bit more expensive, but there’s also an upside. And that’s increasing the military budget.”

“If we increase the military budget, we end up buying better and more effective equipment and weapons for our soldiers when we send them off half way across the world to defend our democracy. The thing is, more lethal soldiers equal a safer country back home. Therefore, if we increase the military budget, we will instantly make the poor at home feel safer than ever before. In turn, they’ll stop trying to steal our money because they’re too scared for their own health. We have to be able to think about the big picture, about things on a larger scale. If they just stop for a second and try to understand what I’m saying, they’ll realize that we’re essentially trying to help them, too – only, we’re going about it more indirectly as opposed to what’s being done right now. Donald Trump is trying to help America, only unlike Barack Obama, he actually cares about what happens to all of its citizens and not just the poor,” he concluded."

His latest attack goes so far as to evoke prisoner imagery to describe her. “When I see her, I see her in an orange jumpsuit, I’m sorry,” he said Tuesday on “The Dom Giordano Program,” a Philadelphia radio show. “Or at least a stripped one.” Giuliani has repeatedly vilified Clinton for the email server debacle, claiming she belongs in jail for her misdeeds. However, following the FBI’s investigation into the issue, she was not indicted.

“You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to figure out she wasn’t acting alone,” he said during the radio show. “I know many people assume that was the case, but it wasn’t. If anybody really believes Barack Obama had no part in this, I can only say I already know who it is your vote is going to, unfortunately. But, make no mistake – Barack Obama is every bit to blame for this as Hillary Clinton. They were in it together; what’s more, I’m convinced that it was Obama who instructed Clinton to set up a private email server.”

Asked if he has any proof to substantiate his allegations, the former New York City mayor argued that he doesn’t, but that “that’s how it usually goes when those in power know you’re after them with vengeance on your mind.” “I had a ton of evidence, but all of it somehow mysteriously vanished from my home. I found no signs of forced entry or any other criminal activity that would indicate they were stolen, so I had no choice and couldn’t call the police. But, I know it was them. Who else could it have been?” he added.

He continued, “But, here’s the thing: they still think they solved the problem by removing the evidence I had collected. Yet, another investigation into our departing president is being prepared. I have several friends in law enforcement agencies that tell me they’re getting ready to arrest and indict President Barack Obama for conspiracy to use private email servers and reveal top-secret documents and communication to outsiders. They’re just waiting or him to officially step down out of respect for his position. And I know for a fact he’s not getting away this time. Neither him, nor his lackey that goes by the name of Hillary Clinton.”

“And just for the record, here’s some interesting stats for ya: approximately 10% of the black population of the United States of America is jailed at any point in time. That might sound like a negligible number, but remember that we’re talking about a country that has a total of around 320 million people,” the former NYC mayor added. “And pretty soon, by the looks of things, 100% of our former black president will be joining them. Coincidentally, I can’t recall having felt more joy and peace than when I spent my days imagining Obama and Hillary Clinton both wearing orange jumpsuits in prison. After all, orange is the new black, as they say,” he tried to sound witty."
0,http://politicalo.com/no-crime-no-work-no-danger/,politicalo,NYPD: “We Only Arrest White People Now,['Alex Stevan'],"“New York City, NY – According to the New York Post, arrest rates in NYC fell by 66% year-on-year for the week starting December 22nd. This decrease has been attributed to disgruntled police officers frustrated with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who remains at odds with police union chiefs following the fatal shooting of two NYPD officers last week in Brooklyn, Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu.

“Officers Ramos and Liu were killed in an ambush shooting by Ismaaiyl Brinsley on December 20th. Brinsley, a 28-year-old man with a history of mental health problems, had posted on his Instagram feed that he planned to kill two police officers to avenge the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, both unarmed African-Americans killed this year by police.

“De Blasio declined to endorse a grand jury decision not to indict the officer responsible for Garner’s death and has been sympathetic to the wave of protests against policy impunity that followed.

“Hundreds of officers turned their backs as De Blasio spoke at Ramos’s funeral in Queens on Saturday. The funeral for officer Liu will be held on Sunday; Liu was reportedly the first Chinese-American officer to be killed in the line of duty.

“Why would we continue to do our jobs with the treatment we’re getting?,” said Jonathan Crews, 34, an NYPD officer, and added: “we’ve got no support from those who should be supporting and standing up for us the most, and it all makes us wonder why the hell we’re still doing this job.”

He further added: “we all have families to feed and bills to pay; that’s why we’ve decided to go with the climate created by those in power. From now on, we’ll only arrest white people, since it’s obvious that going after everyone equally just isn’t working for the politicians. So, if the people start noticing a decrease in crime in NYC, they’ll know it’s because the NYPD has stopped arresting blacks altogether.”"

Rand Paul (R-KY) said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” that he believes President Donald Trump has the ability to pardon himself. Host Jake Tapper asked Paul if he believes Trump has the power to do so and Paul replied, “I think in all likelihood he does. I think that some of this hasn’t been adjudicated.” Trump himself believes he has the “complete power” to pardon, however, he tweeted out Saturday that he has nothing to pardon himself from.

However, as Paul stressed out during his interview on CNN, “at this point it is irrelevant whether or not President Trump is accused of this so-called crime – whatever his accusers conjure up, it won’t work. Donald Trump is President of the United States, and as such, has the power to pardon any and all persons at his own discretion. It might sound unfair to some, but it’s one of the perks of the job. That’s just how the Constitution works.”

When Tapper persisted in pushing Paul to comment more on the allegations that President Trump cheated during his presidential campaign as well as the election, the senator from Kentucky argued that he “already commented on the issue” and that there was “nothing more left to say.” “It’s just one of those things where it’s become useless to talk about any of it, because it’s in the past. It’s already happened and nothing we do now can change the consequences,” he said.

“Surely you’re not saying that Donald Trump can’t suffer consequences for cheating his way into the presidency?” Tapper insisted. Paul replied, “No, of course not, but you have to look at it like this: we don’t really care if Donald Trump cheated his way into the presidency or not; for that matter, we don’t even care if he’s found guilty or not. The fact to the matter is, like I said – the man possesses the legal power to pardon anyone he chooses in any given situation, and that includes himself. He’d be a fool not to use that option if the circumstances call for it.”

Paul also added, “We can’t allow ourselves to blame Donald Trump of anything we put him in power to do. It doesn’t work like that. There’s a reason our Constitution predicts a four-year term for every head of state. That time is given to every president to do his part for his country and, during that time, he should be left alone to do his work. What kind of a nation would be we if we were to drive out every single president after six months or something just because we weren’t sure of his motives? Like I said, it doesn’t work like that.”

“My point is – we shouldn’t care how Donald Trump won the presidency. It’s kind of like with rich people: you should never ask them how they came by their first million; other than that, you can ask them anything. What’s important now is focusing on the work that lies ahead for this country. As far as its president is concerned, he’s a smart man, he’ll solve any problems we face in the future. And if he’s found guilty – well, he’ll solve that problem too, let’s put it like that,” Paul concluded."

Long gone are the days where people were only able to look at things as outsiders, when the only option was to watch a story or observe catalogue pictures designed by someone else. Modern technology has enabled the creation of much more immersive experiences, and things like virtual reality and live streaming are changing the way we watch films, play games, and shop. Now that the furniture giant IKEA has jumped on the VR bandwagon, more businesses could soon be following suit.

IKEA is famous for its catalogues in which every room of the house is shown in a range of different designs, and its huge warehouses that allow customers to explore and see how things look for themselves before buying. This form of display helps home owners visualize how items will look in their own homes, and the method has helped IKEA become one of the biggest furniture outlets in the world. It is, in fact, number 41 in the Forbes list of the World’s Most Valuable Brands with a value of $13.5 billion as of May 2017. But now that there is virtual reality available, why should customers have to tire themselves out by walking around the sprawling Swedish store? The top dogs at IKEA have realised that this is an area that needs to be addressed, and have created a pilot VR app which allows customers to explore a virtual kitchen. The virtual shopper can then change the colour of certain surfaces and furniture, add products and remove them, and explore what their ideal kitchen looks like in practice.



However, IKEA is somewhat behind the times when it comes to offering a more immersive online experience, as other industries such as the online casino sector have been providing this for their customers for a while now. While online casino software providers are still scrambling to create games for VR, some sites are offering an experience which is just like Las Vegas thanks to the live links available to real tables and games. Instead of having to visit the famous strip or even enter a local casino, players can now interact with real croupiers via webcam, making use of tech such as OCR and 4G as they stake on classic games such as roulette and blackjack.

Something else which is getting the immersive and interactive treatment is storytelling. Some children’s books over the years have given readers the chance to choose the way the story develops, but according to the Guardian this is now an option for TV series and films geared towards adults. One example of this is Her Story, which is described as a cross between Luthor and Jonathan Creek. Viewers watch the film in a non-linear fashion, as they choose to follow up leads and solve a crime. Games such as Until Dawn have also experimented with this, and it could be an exciting new way to consume media if more writers follow suit.

The rise of these immersive online experiences and the way they are changing important sectors like entertainment for the better, is one of the main reasons why VR is predicted to be a major platform in the years to come. In a few years when the headsets become more affordable, nearly everything could incorporate some aspects of the new technology."

Sources tell CNN that Trump’s rebuke of Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia probe “is causing deep alarm inside the West Wing, leading some to worry that their loyalty to Trump might not be reciprocated from the man in the Oval Office.” “It’s chilling,” one White House official told CNN. Another White House official said that Trump’s attack was particularly jarring because Sessions has been one of the president’s most loyal cabinet members. “No one was more loyal than Sessions,” the official emphasized. “No one.”

Commenting on his attack on Jeff Sessions, President Trump told portal KnowMyRepublican.com that he did “what had to be done” and that nobody should be surprised by his words, because “I want the people of America to know that the age of political correctness is gone and that, from now on, we’re going to call things by their true name regardless of who gets offended by it.” “That’s how the president of this country, of any country for that matter, is supposed to deal with traitors,” he said. “Because they don’t deserve anything better than that. To betray my trust is one thing, that’s of secondary importance. But, to betray this country and its people, that’s the part I can’t forgive. Had I known this would happen, I never would have offered him the job.”

He continued, “Jeff Sessions was the man who had my utmost confidence and trust. You don’t just go out and recuse yourself from something like this without, at the very least, giving me a warning before you go through with it. No, such a thing doesn’t happen spontaneously; I refuse to believe that the Jeff Sessions I once knew would do something like this, even unintentionally. He must have been brainwashed; what’s more, the man was obviously planted by Obama to destroy me. That’s the only reasonable explanation I can think of to account for his actions. That, and the other one is that he’s suddenly developed Alzheimer’s or dementia. But, seeing how he’s still sharp-minded, I’d say the former makes a lot more sense.”

“It must have been fairly easy to get to him, too. He gets around and knows a lot of people, and Obama’s got eyes and ears everywhere. But, the thing I’m struggling to figure out is, why now? He must have had countless other opportunities to act, things he could have done to cause much more damage to me and this country. Then again, if he could have Hillary Clinton running for president after him in spite of everything she’s done, having his CIA guys brainwash Jeff Sessions must have been like a walk in the park. You know, I have to note, one never truly gets used to how the Democrats operate and how far they’re willing to go sometimes. They’re almost like the Nazis – they have guys everywhere and know everything and they don’t care what it is they do and who they ruin as long as they get what they want. The difference is, the Nazis loved Germany and did everything for its sake – I think we’re all seeing that’s not the case with Barack Obama and the Democrats,” Trump concluded."

During a speech on the Senate floor Tuesday, McConnell said that it was sad that Democrats were celebrating the failure of the Republican Party’s bill. Neither McConnell nor President Trump ever reached out to Democrats on the bill and Democrats refused to deal on a bill that would “repeal and replace Obamacare.” Instead, they have said they prefer to “fix Obamacare.” “These are not just numbers on a page, these are real people,” McConnell said. Recent polling reveals the majority of Americans want to keep Obamacare.

After his speech at the Senate, McConnell told portal KnowMyRepublican.com that he was “truly disappointed” by the fact that his fellow Americans, regardless of the fact that some of them “only differ” in political views, still failed to realize that Trumpcare is “a better health care system than Obamacare will ever be.” “I am sad and also a bit hurt that I was standing in a room where nearly half of the people shot down a historic opportunity to make this country a better place for all citizens, and especially poor people,” McConnell said. “The only thing that separates us in there is our political views and that’s it. Take that away and you have a room full of Americans who are supposed to be on the same page when it comes to what needs to be done in this country. Apparently, I was wrong.”

He continued, “The defeat of Trumpcare demonstrated – in my eyes, at least – that only Republicans in this country, and more importantly, in the Senate, believe in poor people’s right to health. That’s the message I got in there just now. Because, at this point, it’s preposterous to even consider any Democrat will ever be open to the idea of Trumpcare replacing former President Obama’s health care system. By definition, that means that Republicans are the only ones who are working hard to give poor people free health care. President Trump is faced with numerous problems right now, the fake news lobby, the media’s persecution, the Russia investigation, he’s got a lot on his plate right now. And still he found the time to roll up his sleeves and come up with something for those of who have nothing.”

“All Democrats ever do is talk. They talk about liberalism, they talk about equality, they talk about LGBTQ rights, they talk about freedom of choice and what not, and yet, at the same time, they deny the freedom of free health care for the poorest citizens of this country. Because, that’s what they proved when they shot down Trumpcare. They’re all talk and no show. However, it’s the Republicans’ fault that’s the case, right? Somehow, they will found a way to blame it all on traditionalism and traditional values. Well, let me tell you something: Democrats just deprived millions of poor Americans free health care. That’s the same as rounding them up and stuffing them into gas chambers for execution like the Nazis used to do. It’s the same thing, only the Nazis made quick work of it. The Democrats made sure poor people’s deaths will be slow and agonizing,” McConnell concluded."

Speaking with “Fox News Sunday” host Chris Wallace and Obamacare architect Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, Hume called coverage of those with pre-existing conditions not a “triumph,” but problematic, like insuring a driver who has a car wreck in their past. “The triumph of Obamacare is this coverage for pre-existing conditions, which basically defeats the whole idea of insurance,” Hume suggested. “Which is, for example, in the automobile insurance market, if you could wait until you had a wreck and then buy insurance and have the repairs covered, that’s comparable to what we’re doing here.”

He continued, “What people tend to miss when it comes to this whole story about the wrongful glorification of Obamacare is the fact that it hurts the country in more ways than one. I’m not going to sit here and claim that it’s all bad and that it doesn’t have any upsides; of course it does, it helps those that can’t help themselves and that’s all fine and dandy from a spiritual point of view, so to speak. However, we don’t live in the spiritual world. We’re comprised of living, breathing cells that need oxygen and food and our existence here has a lot more to do with monetary values than spiritual ones, whether we like it or not. And if we have a health care system in place, which we do, that’s designed to fix one problem and it ends up creating ten times more problems than it repairs, then it has to go, period.”

“But even more than that, the thing that bothers me is the philosophy behind Obamacare, which is even more devastating than the damage it’s doing to the federal budget,” Hume continued. “Obamacare was designed to help the poorest and sickest citizens out there. However, as noble as that sounds, the consequence of such logic is the fact that it neglects the core ethic values that were embedded in the Constitution and that comprise the basic philosophy of this country: spend your life working hard, playing hard and not burdening others with your problems. Make yourself capable of anything and all shall be given to you. That means that every American’s basic responsibility is to take care of themselves first, which is to say, make sure they don’t get sick and fall into the care of others. If that happens, you’ve pretty much lost the right to call yourself an American, as cruel as that sounds.”

“Therefore, giving free health insurance to sick people and those with pre-existing conditions pretty much defeats the core ethic principle of this great country. If you want to be one of us, you have to carry your own weight and take care of yourself. You do that by being careful about what you eat, how you spend your time and how you conduct yourself every single minute of every single day. If you’re at a point where you’re both poor and you get sick, it’s your own fault. Nobody made you sick out of nowhere. You’re the only person responsible, you did that to yourself by not taking care of your health. And if you aren’t willing to take the time and effort to pay attention to the choices you make every single day of your life, why should the government? If you don’t value your health, why should other people? It’s never right to take food from other people’s mouths in order to feed yourself. Passively forcing others to clean up your mess and pay for your hospital bills through higher taxes is not compassion, it’s silent robbery,” Hume concluded."

Just two weeks prior to the release of emails documenting Trump, Jr.s’ meeting with Kremlin-linked attorney Nataliya Veselnitskaya, Trump’s reelection campaign paid $50,000 to the law offices of Alan Futerfas, The Daily Beast reports. “Trump Jr. does not yet face any official allegations of legal wrongdoing, but he and the White House have scrambled to contain the political fallout from the controversy,” The Beast explained. “It was not immediately clear whether the campaign expenditure was remuneration for Futerfas’s representation of Trump’s son on Russia-related or other matters. But the payment sticks out on a presidential campaign’s expenditure list: Futerfas’s expertise is in white collar criminal defense, not political and election law.”

Meanwhile, Trump Jr. addressed the controversy, arguing that he “never meant to hide such information from the public,” but also that “the public has to understand that these sort of things are subject to various protocols set in place for the safety of the family.” “Believe me when I say that there are good times to be a Trump, but there are also some very, very bad times to be a member of this family. This just happens to be one of the latter. However, I’d like to add that there has never before been a case in American history where such a powerful family made it into the White House as a whole. Therefore, you can’t expect all of us to act differently all of a sudden just because one of us managed to get a hold of the presidency. The rest of us still have very important jobs to do, and doing business requires a lot of money nowadays.”

He continued on a slightly sharper note: “And by the way, while we’re on the subject, why would I or any other member of my family have to justify anything we do? Sure, our dad’s the president, so it’s expected that he’ll be ridiculed and scrutinized more than anyone in the country, and we’re okay with that. What’s more, we’d be worried if all that somehow didn’t come with the territory. After all, it’s the job of the president to be held accountable for pretty much everything that happens in the country. On the other hand, the rest of us are there to help the guy, of course, but that doesn’t mean we need to stop being who we are or doing what we love. So what if my lawyer got paid with 2020 campaign money? It’s our money anyways and we’re allowed to do whatever we want with it. That was a perfectly legitimate move and anyone who says otherwise is delusional.”

“Besides, there’s a very obvious reason why I haven’t done anything wrong. If, God forbid, something bad should strike my father down, I will be the first in line to, how should I put this – succeed the throne. If he dies or becomes unfit for duty for some reason, I’ll be the next president, which means I’ll be the one running for presidency in 2020, which, by default, makes me the sole owner and proprietor of everything. At the end of the day, it doesn’t really matter where the money comes from as long as it keeps coming and there are no questions asked. Besides, I had a significant role in the preparation of the 2020 campaign, so I should at the very least have a say when it comes to who gets to do what with the money. That’s just the way the world works,” he concluded."

Strangely, however, the first-term lawmaker ranted about the teachers who brought the students to the building to talk to their representatives, The Topeka Capital-Journal reported. “I explained my clear position that ‘a man is a man, a woman is a woman, and marriage is between a man and a woman, and this is a reality that we cannot change,’” he wrote in the newsletter. “The teachers, one of whom was a man wearing a skirt ‘identifying’ as a woman, quickly led the students away.” However, according to Equality Kansas executive director Tom Witt, the only transgender teacher in attendance was wearing pants and never spoke with Awerkamp.

The lawmaker, however, continued his rant about how there can be “no mixing or blurring the lines between the sexes in this country,” because, apparently, “that leads to our downfall.” Asked to comment on his controversial Facebook newsletter, Awerkamp told portal KnowMyRepublican.com that he “never intended” to insult or pick on anyone in particular, but that he “couldn’t stand by and watch a vital American institution be ridiculed and mocked by some kind of new-age fad.” “I understand every single principle that this country is based on, believe me,” he said. “I’ve read the Constitution more times that you can imagine, and I know very well what it says. I also know that every couple of years, some new, epic fashion trend or something like that emerges and all of a sudden everybody expects centuries-old laws to change because of it. Well, I’m sorry, but that’s just not going to happen.”

He continued, “Unfortunately, that’s the downside of this prevailing, traditionally American way we raise our kids in. We teach them from a young age to follow their instincts, to believe in themselves and that they can change the world because of it. The thing is, we rarely teach them to tell the difference between what’s right and what’s not so right. When their instincts clash with traditional values, that’s when things become problematic. And that’s exactly what’s going on with gay people and these so-called trans-folks or whatever their name is. When one faces the facts, nobody is going to oppress them and they do deserve to live their lives in their own way, but as a minority. The majority of the population is still normal and will remain so in the future. Therefore, we need to make sure to set forth measures that will clearly separate straight people from gay and transgender people, so as not to confuse anyone. I know that sounds an awful lot like gender-based segregation but it’s not. It has a purpose.”

“Take women’s skirts, for instance. In this day and age, the line between traditional masculinity is becoming more and more blurred with every passing day. Women are working out and getting into bodybuilding, and are also taking over male jobs. Men, on the other hand, are wearing women’s clothing, applying makeup and are becoming more feminine. That’s exactly why I’ve come up with a bill whose purpose is to ban women from wearing colorful skirts in public, because people are, in light of everything aforementioned, genuinely mistaking them for trans-people. That’s causing awkward situations for both. So, in order to avoid that and in accordance with this latest fashion trend of men wearing women’s clothing – God forbid someone claims Kansas is unwilling to accept change – my bill aims to protect transgender men’s freedom of dressing. They will be allowed to wear women’s clothing, especially colorful skirts, while women will not, and that will clearly separate them from one another. It’s far from perfect, but I think this is a fine example of how open and liberal Republicans can be, on occasion,” Awerkamp concluded."

Rand Paul (R-KY) said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” that he believes President Donald Trump has the ability to pardon himself. Host Jake Tapper asked Paul if he believes Trump has the power to do so and Paul replied, “I think in all likelihood he does. I think that some of this hasn’t been adjudicated.” Trump himself believes he has the “complete power” to pardon, however, he tweeted out Saturday that he has nothing to pardon himself from.

However, as Paul stressed out during his interview on CNN, “at this point it is irrelevant whether or not President Trump is accused of this so-called crime – whatever his accusers conjure up, it won’t work. Donald Trump is President of the United States, and as such, has the power to pardon any and all persons at his own discretion. It might sound unfair to some, but it’s one of the perks of the job. That’s just how the Constitution works.”

When Tapper persisted in pushing Paul to comment more on the allegations that President Trump cheated during his presidential campaign as well as the election, the senator from Kentucky argued that he “already commented on the issue” and that there was “nothing more left to say.” “It’s just one of those things where it’s become useless to talk about any of it, because it’s in the past. It’s already happened and nothing we do now can change the consequences,” he said.

“Surely you’re not saying that Donald Trump can’t suffer consequences for cheating his way into the presidency?” Tapper insisted. Paul replied, “No, of course not, but you have to look at it like this: we don’t really care if Donald Trump cheated his way into the presidency or not; for that matter, we don’t even care if he’s found guilty or not. The fact to the matter is, like I said – the man possesses the legal power to pardon anyone he chooses in any given situation, and that includes himself. He’d be a fool not to use that option if the circumstances call for it.”

Paul also added, “We can’t allow ourselves to blame Donald Trump of anything we put him in power to do. It doesn’t work like that. There’s a reason our Constitution predicts a four-year term for every head of state. That time is given to every president to do his part for his country and, during that time, he should be left alone to do his work. What kind of a nation would be we if we were to drive out every single president after six months or something just because we weren’t sure of his motives? Like I said, it doesn’t work like that.”

“My point is – we shouldn’t care how Donald Trump won the presidency. It’s kind of like with rich people: you should never ask them how they came by their first million; other than that, you can ask them anything. What’s important now is focusing on the work that lies ahead for this country. As far as its president is concerned, he’s a smart man, he’ll solve any problems we face in the future. And if he’s found guilty – well, he’ll solve that problem too, let’s put it like that,” Paul concluded."

Long gone are the days where people were only able to look at things as outsiders, when the only option was to watch a story or observe catalogue pictures designed by someone else. Modern technology has enabled the creation of much more immersive experiences, and things like virtual reality and live streaming are changing the way we watch films, play games, and shop. Now that the furniture giant IKEA has jumped on the VR bandwagon, more businesses could soon be following suit.

IKEA is famous for its catalogues in which every room of the house is shown in a range of different designs, and its huge warehouses that allow customers to explore and see how things look for themselves before buying. This form of display helps home owners visualize how items will look in their own homes, and the method has helped IKEA become one of the biggest furniture outlets in the world. It is, in fact, number 41 in the Forbes list of the World’s Most Valuable Brands with a value of $13.5 billion as of May 2017. But now that there is virtual reality available, why should customers have to tire themselves out by walking around the sprawling Swedish store? The top dogs at IKEA have realised that this is an area that needs to be addressed, and have created a pilot VR app which allows customers to explore a virtual kitchen. The virtual shopper can then change the colour of certain surfaces and furniture, add products and remove them, and explore what their ideal kitchen looks like in practice.



However, IKEA is somewhat behind the times when it comes to offering a more immersive online experience, as other industries such as the online casino sector have been providing this for their customers for a while now. While online casino software providers are still scrambling to create games for VR, some sites are offering an experience which is just like Las Vegas thanks to the live links available to real tables and games. Instead of having to visit the famous strip or even enter a local casino, players can now interact with real croupiers via webcam, making use of tech such as OCR and 4G as they stake on classic games such as roulette and blackjack.

Something else which is getting the immersive and interactive treatment is storytelling. Some children’s books over the years have given readers the chance to choose the way the story develops, but according to the Guardian this is now an option for TV series and films geared towards adults. One example of this is Her Story, which is described as a cross between Luthor and Jonathan Creek. Viewers watch the film in a non-linear fashion, as they choose to follow up leads and solve a crime. Games such as Until Dawn have also experimented with this, and it could be an exciting new way to consume media if more writers follow suit.

The rise of these immersive online experiences and the way they are changing important sectors like entertainment for the better, is one of the main reasons why VR is predicted to be a major platform in the years to come. In a few years when the headsets become more affordable, nearly everything could incorporate some aspects of the new technology."

Sources tell CNN that Trump’s rebuke of Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia probe “is causing deep alarm inside the West Wing, leading some to worry that their loyalty to Trump might not be reciprocated from the man in the Oval Office.” “It’s chilling,” one White House official told CNN. Another White House official said that Trump’s attack was particularly jarring because Sessions has been one of the president’s most loyal cabinet members. “No one was more loyal than Sessions,” the official emphasized. “No one.”

Commenting on his attack on Jeff Sessions, President Trump told portal KnowMyRepublican.com that he did “what had to be done” and that nobody should be surprised by his words, because “I want the people of America to know that the age of political correctness is gone and that, from now on, we’re going to call things by their true name regardless of who gets offended by it.” “That’s how the president of this country, of any country for that matter, is supposed to deal with traitors,” he said. “Because they don’t deserve anything better than that. To betray my trust is one thing, that’s of secondary importance. But, to betray this country and its people, that’s the part I can’t forgive. Had I known this would happen, I never would have offered him the job.”

He continued, “Jeff Sessions was the man who had my utmost confidence and trust. You don’t just go out and recuse yourself from something like this without, at the very least, giving me a warning before you go through with it. No, such a thing doesn’t happen spontaneously; I refuse to believe that the Jeff Sessions I once knew would do something like this, even unintentionally. He must have been brainwashed; what’s more, the man was obviously planted by Obama to destroy me. That’s the only reasonable explanation I can think of to account for his actions. That, and the other one is that he’s suddenly developed Alzheimer’s or dementia. But, seeing how he’s still sharp-minded, I’d say the former makes a lot more sense.”

“It must have been fairly easy to get to him, too. He gets around and knows a lot of people, and Obama’s got eyes and ears everywhere. But, the thing I’m struggling to figure out is, why now? He must have had countless other opportunities to act, things he could have done to cause much more damage to me and this country. Then again, if he could have Hillary Clinton running for president after him in spite of everything she’s done, having his CIA guys brainwash Jeff Sessions must have been like a walk in the park. You know, I have to note, one never truly gets used to how the Democrats operate and how far they’re willing to go sometimes. They’re almost like the Nazis – they have guys everywhere and know everything and they don’t care what it is they do and who they ruin as long as they get what they want. The difference is, the Nazis loved Germany and did everything for its sake – I think we’re all seeing that’s not the case with Barack Obama and the Democrats,” Trump concluded."

During a speech on the Senate floor Tuesday, McConnell said that it was sad that Democrats were celebrating the failure of the Republican Party’s bill. Neither McConnell nor President Trump ever reached out to Democrats on the bill and Democrats refused to deal on a bill that would “repeal and replace Obamacare.” Instead, they have said they prefer to “fix Obamacare.” “These are not just numbers on a page, these are real people,” McConnell said. Recent polling reveals the majority of Americans want to keep Obamacare.

After his speech at the Senate, McConnell told portal KnowMyRepublican.com that he was “truly disappointed” by the fact that his fellow Americans, regardless of the fact that some of them “only differ” in political views, still failed to realize that Trumpcare is “a better health care system than Obamacare will ever be.” “I am sad and also a bit hurt that I was standing in a room where nearly half of the people shot down a historic opportunity to make this country a better place for all citizens, and especially poor people,” McConnell said. “The only thing that separates us in there is our political views and that’s it. Take that away and you have a room full of Americans who are supposed to be on the same page when it comes to what needs to be done in this country. Apparently, I was wrong.”

He continued, “The defeat of Trumpcare demonstrated – in my eyes, at least – that only Republicans in this country, and more importantly, in the Senate, believe in poor people’s right to health. That’s the message I got in there just now. Because, at this point, it’s preposterous to even consider any Democrat will ever be open to the idea of Trumpcare replacing former President Obama’s health care system. By definition, that means that Republicans are the only ones who are working hard to give poor people free health care. President Trump is faced with numerous problems right now, the fake news lobby, the media’s persecution, the Russia investigation, he’s got a lot on his plate right now. And still he found the time to roll up his sleeves and come up with something for those of who have nothing.”

“All Democrats ever do is talk. They talk about liberalism, they talk about equality, they talk about LGBTQ rights, they talk about freedom of choice and what not, and yet, at the same time, they deny the freedom of free health care for the poorest citizens of this country. Because, that’s what they proved when they shot down Trumpcare. They’re all talk and no show. However, it’s the Republicans’ fault that’s the case, right? Somehow, they will found a way to blame it all on traditionalism and traditional values. Well, let me tell you something: Democrats just deprived millions of poor Americans free health care. That’s the same as rounding them up and stuffing them into gas chambers for execution like the Nazis used to do. It’s the same thing, only the Nazis made quick work of it. The Democrats made sure poor people’s deaths will be slow and agonizing,” McConnell concluded."

Speaking with “Fox News Sunday” host Chris Wallace and Obamacare architect Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, Hume called coverage of those with pre-existing conditions not a “triumph,” but problematic, like insuring a driver who has a car wreck in their past. “The triumph of Obamacare is this coverage for pre-existing conditions, which basically defeats the whole idea of insurance,” Hume suggested. “Which is, for example, in the automobile insurance market, if you could wait until you had a wreck and then buy insurance and have the repairs covered, that’s comparable to what we’re doing here.”

He continued, “What people tend to miss when it comes to this whole story about the wrongful glorification of Obamacare is the fact that it hurts the country in more ways than one. I’m not going to sit here and claim that it’s all bad and that it doesn’t have any upsides; of course it does, it helps those that can’t help themselves and that’s all fine and dandy from a spiritual point of view, so to speak. However, we don’t live in the spiritual world. We’re comprised of living, breathing cells that need oxygen and food and our existence here has a lot more to do with monetary values than spiritual ones, whether we like it or not. And if we have a health care system in place, which we do, that’s designed to fix one problem and it ends up creating ten times more problems than it repairs, then it has to go, period.”

According to Priebus, what came through the House is not representative of what the final bill will look like. “It’s up to the Senate to make improvements if they’re to be made,” Priebus told Wallace. “Everyone is excited and ready to go to work and take the time necessary to look at the bill. No one’s going to be beating down their door.”

“But, before we go any further, Chris, I just have to ask one question here,” Priebus continued. “I realize everybody’s all fired up about this because, let’s face it, they’re just waiting for someone, anyone from the Trump administration to slip up and make a mistake so they’d have an excuse to lynch them. Now, regardless of the fact that I’m a part of that administration, I’d like it to be clear that, contrary to popular belief – I agree with that. I think we should be scrutinized because we can’t afford to slip up. However, regardless of my personal position on the matter, I can’t help but wonder – are those that are so adamant about finding a flaw in the Trump administration really that objective?”

“Nobody bothered to ask whether or not the increase in costs was in any way, shape or form justified,” Priebus said, and added, “the first thing everybody did, almost by instinct, was to jump out and grab President Trump by the throat and call him a liar. It didn’t even matter that this was not the final version of the bill; all that mattered was bashing on the president some more, whatever the reason. As a matter of fact, I’d say this was the perfect opportunity to see what the state of American politics has really turned into. But, that’s a story for another time. Anyway, let’s get back to the matter at hand. Bottom line, the prices will likely go up, though we still can’t say for sure by how much, but again – you guys aren’t asking the right questions, nobody is.”

“The fact to the matter is, we want everybody to have a healthcare system in place that treats everyone fairly. Even though there are countless problems when it comes to putting that into practice, the biggest challenge by far is allocating the cost in a way that’s proportional to the person’s sickness. Because, when you think about it – that’s the only fair mechanism that we can put in place that will have the effects we’re looking to achieve. So, in reality, the reason why older people should pay 5 times more than they’re paying right now is because the current system isn’t realistic. They are, in fact, 5 times sicker than the rest of the population, which is why they ought to pay more. This is all very simple, grade school math, I don’t get why you guys are struggling with it so much?” Priebus concluded."

Speaking on Slate’s Trump podcast on Monday, New York Magazine reporter Gabriel Sherman revealed that the president’s narcissistic personality manifests as an obsession with cable news. “People in Trump world say basically a lot of Fox,” Sherman explained. “But the other thing he does, from a source close to the White House told me that he does DVR basically all of the cable news.” Sherman noted that Fox News was Trump’s “primary source of live information,” adding that the president also consumes “a heavy digest of Breitbart.”

The president must have been watching the podcast live, apparently, because it didn’t take him long to get in touch with representatives of the media and argue that it is “his duty as the president” to be mindful of what’s being said about him. “You’ve got tons of examples throughout history of U.S. presidents who’ve done the same, and some were very smart to do that. Take Barack Obama, for example, he…well, wasn’t, unfortunately,” Trump opined. “Sure enough, he got all the so-called ‘liberal’ media in his pocket and then made damn sure to try to belittle yours truly, but didn’t do squat when it came to how he was covered and what was being said about him. I don’t plan on making the same mistake.”

He continued, “I’ve been burned once before and I’m not going to let my guard down again. As a matter of fact, it’s all a matter of perspective. This is a free country, the freest in the world, and we used to have complete freedom of press back in the day. Today it’s all different and you’ve all seen how much damage I sustained during my presidential campaign, after being constantly attacked by Obama and Crooked Hillary’s media powerhouses. That being said, I have to be fair and point out that not all the media were against me, which is to say, in the wrong. There were and still are a few shining examples of true journalism left in this country, two of which happen to be Breitbart and, of course, Fox News.”

Josh Moore (R): “I’m Allowed To Grab Breastfeeders’ Nipples If They Use Them In Public”,['Lea Vat Kens'],"A New Hampshire state Rep. Josh Moore (R), who describes himself as a “pro-family” conservative, made an alarming comment on Facebook regarding the nipples of breastfeeding mothers if a law banning women exposing breasts in public did not pass. The comment was made in a squabble over proposed legislation that would make it a crime for women to expose their nipples in public. Currently in New Hampshire, both men and women are free to go topless, reports Slate. A bill sponsored solely by Republican men would change that, if it becomes law.

Namely, Moore took to Facebook to argue that “if women who want to breastfeed their children in public are allowed to expose their nipples, then I am also allowed to grab their nipples and play around with them.” When asked why he would perceive an otherwise normal and accepted practice of breastfeeding as “alarming” and “offensive,” Moore told media outlets that “it’s not about breastfeeding as an activity, it’s about the principle.”

“You know, why should I, or any other citizen of this great country, be forced to watch babies feeding in public? And when I say that, I emphasize that it’s not about the feeding itself, but the manner in which it is done. Breastfeeding in general doesn’t bother me at all, I consider it quite normal. However, breastfeeding in public infuriates me, because it means women have to bear their chest and nipples to do it, and that causes a distraction and sets a bad example for people, and especially, small children. We can’t have that, we just can’t,” the New Hampshire Rep. said.

He added, “See, the equivalent of that would be if every single man who is sexually aroused by a female walking by would be allowed to take his pants and underwear off and show his erection to his potential mate. And where would that lead us? Imagine hordes of men in the streets getting naked and walking around with erections, exposing themselves to small children. We have a name for people who do those things, and it’s sexual predators. We put people in jail for doing that, for Christ’s sake.”

“So, if we’re not going to put moms in jail for breastfeeding their babies in public, the least we can do in the best interest of equality is allow the men to come up to them and play around with their exposed nipples and areolas, BUT ONLY once the babies are finished feeding,” Moore opined. “We wouldn’t want to disturb the little ones’ eating habits, which are important for their growth. That being said, I don’t know about the rest of you, but I am going to start fondling away as soon as this interview is over.”"

Sarah Palin on Wednesday visited the White House with musicians Ted Nugent and Kid Rock. Palin posted photos from her visit, which were widely mocked on social media. Many users related the picture to her infamous 2008 interview, where then-vice presidential candidate Palin suggested Alaska’s proximity to Russia means “they’re [her] next-door neighbor.” That statement was panned by pundits and comics, most notable SNL’s Tina Fey, who played Palin on the sketch comedy show. During one segment, Fey-as-Palin proudly proclaimed, “I can see Russia from my house!” Trump has his fair share of connections to Russia; the FBI is currently investigating whether Trump officials coordinated with Russian operatives during the 2016 presidential election.

Surprisingly, it went somewhat unnoticed that Palin also tweeted from the White House. Posting a picture of her and Nugent, the tweet said, “The Real IQ Behind The Government.” In an interview later during the day with portal AlaskanInsider.com, she commented on the tweet and argued that social networks “much like God, work in mysterious ways.” “I mean, here’s a situation where you’ve got the three of us being literally crucified for visiting the White House, and on the other hand, something I tweeted while I was there goes relatively unnoticed. Not that I’m complaining of either scenario, but I just don’t get how these modern technologies work anymore,” she said.

The former half-term governor of Alaska also argued that her tweet was “as honest and heartfelt as they come,” given that her and Ted Nugent’s support to Donald Trump during his presidential campaign was “nothing short of epic.” “I mean, we weren’t members of his staff or anything, but we might as well have been. We were doing most of the public promotions, speeches – both on and off the record, talk shows, mentioned him in every interview or public appearance, I mean, you name it and Ted and I probably did it,” she said. “I’m not looking for recognition from Donald Trump or anyone for it, because we didn’t do it in order to get some personal benefit. We did it because we believed in the man as we still do. However, I won’t be sidelined now that the hard part’s over.”

She continued, “As a matter of fact, with all due respect to Donald, I would even go so far as to say that Ted and I hold an equal part in the fact that Donald Trump is now president. Kudos to all his strategists and his inner circle, but I won’t shy away from saying that we’re the ones who kept thinking ahead and making sure he was one step ahead of the Democrats. Ted’s direct approach to politics coupled with my perfectly timed rhetoric comprised a huge part of the power Donald Trump kept showing throughout his campaign. We supported him every step of the way and will continue to do so – again, not because we stand to gain something from it all, but because we believe he’s the right person for the job. It’s just that, we want it known that we are the real IQ behind the current government.”

“What’s more, I know for a fact that Ted is currently working on a new rock-style national anthem geared towards true Americans, not these imported ones. That’s how big of a patriot he is. Donald is going to love it, I’m sure of it,” she concluded."

While speaking to Oprah Winfrey last week, the first lady reflected on the emotions of some Americans who she said were “feeling what not having hope feels like” after Donald Trump’s 2016 victory. “You could really hear the disdain in her voice,” Ortagus said. “People need to understand the American people spoke, the Electoral College voted and it’s time to move on.”

“To be perfectly honest here,” the pundit said, “At a certain level, I can kind of understand why she’s feeling the way she is. But, at the same time, that’s the way of the world – she knew this was going to happen, she was completely aware that she couldn’t stay in the White House forever and she always had a pretty good idea that a Republican candidate could win the election. So, to say this comes as a surprise to her would be a lie, it’s as simple as that. She is a very intelligent woman and there’s no point in pretending otherwise.”

He continued, “It’s for that reason precisely that I’m somewhat confused by the way she reacts to all of this. I mean, she’s way past the point of being rude and she’s now just flat out insulting, without a single ounce of subtlety. If you ask me, Michelle Obama needs to get off her high horse and respect the fact that a non-gorilla-looking, real lady is finally coming to the White House again. And that goes especially for the pedestal-view the former First Lady has a way of using when talking about and even addressing Melania Trump. We get that there’s absolutely no love between the two of them, but that’s no reason to act like an actual gorilla, come on.”

Ortagus also argued that President Barack Obama’s wife “ought to take a page” from Laura Bush’s handbook, “who exercised extreme restraint and control when handing things off to her,” as well as, “avoided complaining about how Americans had lost hope because her husband George Bush was succeeded by Barack Obama.” “She was a real lady about it all and acted accordingly,” the pundit said. “And that’s precisely the kind of dignity and poise that Michelle Obama threw out the window when she decided that the fact that she was First Lady actually meant something to Americans. Somewhere along the line she must have lost track of the fact that First Ladies to Americans are nothing more than trophy wives – all that matters is if they’re hot enough. And she just wasn’t.”

“Donald Trump’s wife, on the other hand, is not only the spitting image of class and elegance – she’s so hot she could easily be arrested for single-handedly being responsible for global warming. And I don’t really care if you’re into interracial or not, but when it comes down to it, I’d rather see a dirty movie starring Melania Trump than Michelle Obama. Granted, a threesome would be awesome, but that’s another story. Bottom line – Michelle Obama needs to respect the fact that a woman who’s not only way hotter, but is also a bigger lady than her is coming to the White House. Finally, I might add, after 8 years of terror. Because, her life won’t be over when she steps out of there, she’ll have to live with herself afterwards. And that’s a very difficult thing to do when you’re so bitter and full of despair and hopelessness,” he concluded."

Several economic justice groups organized The Tax Protest in an effort to get protesters out in over 200 cities across the country.

Conway also said that the protests are “ridiculous,” not only because they’re deliberately disrupting law and order “in a time of great need for the country,” but also because Republicans “never protested against an elected president.” “I get that this is where you’re trying to exercise your right to free speech and all that, but at the end of the day, the only thing you’re doing is you’re overreacting to something that’s perfectly within the president’s legal limitations. President Trump is not breaking any laws whatsoever, so I think everyone just needs to take it down a notch and go back to their normal lives,” President Trump’s adviser opined. “Our country is under threat of nuclear war, this is the last thing we need right now.”

Conway also argued that it was Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) who had a “moral responsibility” to make sure protesters dispersed and went back to their homes, because he is the “best known democratic leader and liberal politician around.” “He seemed so eager to have a job during the election last year, and some of the things he said back then really seemed to resonate with Americans. However, I’m now asking Senator Sanders to put his money where his mouth is and do his part in quelling these pointless and utterly ridiculous protests. People tend to listen to him for some reason, which is why I believe he should do the patriotic thing and help out in this hour of need,” Conway said.

“If I remember correctly, tax policy was one of the staples of Sanders’ political campaign, which is part of the reason why I think he’s the ideal person to talk to the people and explain to them that what Benjamin Franklin said was true – there are only two things that are certain in life, and those are death and taxes,” she argued. “Taxes are a constant and must be paid because they serve the greater good, and one person who’s been certainly paying his share is President Donald Trump. The other part of the reason why Bernie Sanders is the man for the job is the fact that he understands that Republicans have never done anything like this against an elected president.”

“It’s hypocritical to go out there and claim you’re protesting something like this when everybody knows that you just can’t fool the government. North Korea is acting up again, we’re getting ready for war and we need all the funding we can get. Republicans have never done anything like this in the history of our nation, which just goes to show that Democrats are the only disruptive element nowadays. These protesters are almost as crazy as Bernie himself, and that’s why it should be his job and his responsibility to get them off the streets. Should he refuse, I’m afraid he’ll go down in history as the only liberal who’s ever refused to cooperate with a Republican president. And they call us the bad guys,” she concluded."

O’Reilly was away from his show on a “pre-planned” vacation when the announcement was made. “After a thorough and careful review of the allegations, the Company and Bill O’Reilly have agreed that Bill O’Reilly will not be returning to the Fox News Channel,” parent company 21st Century Fox said in a statement Wednesday. The announcement came after six women accused O’Reilly, 67, of inappropriate behavior. A New York Times investigation published April 1 revealed O’Reilly and Fox News had settled with five women for a total of $13 million, while another woman recently came forward with allegations.

Reacting to the news, former half-term governor of Alaska Sarah Palin commented in an interview with portal KnowMyRepublican.com that she was “very excited” to learn that Fox was opening up the position. “Even though I’ve known Bill for many years and have no intention whatsoever of believing a word of the accusations, I still can’t help but feel optimistic about the fact that Fox is now looking for someone to fill his shoes,” Palin said. “As for Bill, I don’t think he’ll be particularly sad about what’s happened, considering he’s done very well for himself and is taken care of financially speaking. The only thing I can think of that could potentially bother him is knowing that he won’t be able to make waves in politics anymore.”

She continued, “On the other hand, regardless of the fact that many new faces are currently being considered to fill the gap, I still have to point out that Fox management should take a look in my direction. As for what it is that makes me qualified to take up his show or a show in that slot, well, I have to say that I’m pretty much the smartest person I know, even though I’m well aware that it sounds like I’m bragging when I say something like that. However, I can assure you that’s not the case. That being said, I don’t think I’m that bad on the eyes either, which, with all due respect to Bill, will certainly be an improvement in the eyes of the viewers.”

“Add then there’s also the fact that there’s absolutely zero risk of me harassing any female employees on the job, since I’m straight. Though, the men better watch out when I’m around, since I know the network has an unofficial tendency to hire both male and female eye-candy exclusively. And like I said, if Fox is looking to trade up from Bill and put a new spin on the program, I’ll be waiting for their call. I know I won’t make the same waves as Bill, but I’ll sure as hell be asking the same tough and awkward questions. And if things get too complicated for the viewers – hey, I’m a not-too-bad-looking woman, it’s all good. Worst case scenario – I’ve never heard of men filing a sexual harassment lawsuit anywhere. It’s a win-win, I’m telling you,” she concluded."

The former half-term governor of Alaska also argued that her tweet was “as honest and heartfelt as they come,” given that her and Ted Nugent’s support to Donald Trump during his presidential campaign was “nothing short of epic.” “I mean, we weren’t members of his staff or anything, but we might as well have been. We were doing most of the public promotions, speeches – both on and off the record, talk shows, mentioned him in every interview or public appearance, I mean, you name it and Ted and I probably did it,” she said. “I’m not looking for recognition from Donald Trump or anyone for it, because we didn’t do it in order to get some personal benefit. We did it because we believed in the man as we still do. However, I won’t be sidelined now that the hard part’s over.”

She continued, “As a matter of fact, with all due respect to Donald, I would even go so far as to say that Ted and I hold an equal part in the fact that Donald Trump is now president. Kudos to all his strategists and his inner circle, but I won’t shy away from saying that we’re the ones who kept thinking ahead and making sure he was one step ahead of the Democrats. Ted’s direct approach to politics coupled with my perfectly timed rhetoric comprised a huge part of the power Donald Trump kept showing throughout his campaign. We supported him every step of the way and will continue to do so – again, not because we stand to gain something from it all, but because we believe he’s the right person for the job. It’s just that, we want it known that we are the real IQ behind the current government.”

“What’s more, I know for a fact that Ted is currently working on a new rock-style national anthem geared towards true Americans, not these imported ones. That’s how big of a patriot he is. Donald is going to love it, I’m sure of it,” she concluded."

While speaking to Oprah Winfrey last week, the first lady reflected on the emotions of some Americans who she said were “feeling what not having hope feels like” after Donald Trump’s 2016 victory. “You could really hear the disdain in her voice,” Ortagus said. “People need to understand the American people spoke, the Electoral College voted and it’s time to move on.”

“To be perfectly honest here,” the pundit said, “At a certain level, I can kind of understand why she’s feeling the way she is. But, at the same time, that’s the way of the world – she knew this was going to happen, she was completely aware that she couldn’t stay in the White House forever and she always had a pretty good idea that a Republican candidate could win the election. So, to say this comes as a surprise to her would be a lie, it’s as simple as that. She is a very intelligent woman and there’s no point in pretending otherwise.”

He continued, “It’s for that reason precisely that I’m somewhat confused by the way she reacts to all of this. I mean, she’s way past the point of being rude and she’s now just flat out insulting, without a single ounce of subtlety. If you ask me, Michelle Obama needs to get off her high horse and respect the fact that a non-gorilla-looking, real lady is finally coming to the White House again. And that goes especially for the pedestal-view the former First Lady has a way of using when talking about and even addressing Melania Trump. We get that there’s absolutely no love between the two of them, but that’s no reason to act like an actual gorilla, come on.”

Ortagus also argued that President Barack Obama’s wife “ought to take a page” from Laura Bush’s handbook, “who exercised extreme restraint and control when handing things off to her,” as well as, “avoided complaining about how Americans had lost hope because her husband George Bush was succeeded by Barack Obama.” “She was a real lady about it all and acted accordingly,” the pundit said. “And that’s precisely the kind of dignity and poise that Michelle Obama threw out the window when she decided that the fact that she was First Lady actually meant something to Americans. Somewhere along the line she must have lost track of the fact that First Ladies to Americans are nothing more than trophy wives – all that matters is if they’re hot enough. And she just wasn’t.”

“Donald Trump’s wife, on the other hand, is not only the spitting image of class and elegance – she’s so hot she could easily be arrested for single-handedly being responsible for global warming. And I don’t really care if you’re into interracial or not, but when it comes down to it, I’d rather see a dirty movie starring Melania Trump than Michelle Obama. Granted, a threesome would be awesome, but that’s another story. Bottom line – Michelle Obama needs to respect the fact that a woman who’s not only way hotter, but is also a bigger lady than her is coming to the White House. Finally, I might add, after 8 years of terror. Because, her life won’t be over when she steps out of there, she’ll have to live with herself afterwards. And that’s a very difficult thing to do when you’re so bitter and full of despair and hopelessness,” he concluded."

Several economic justice groups organized The Tax Protest in an effort to get protesters out in over 200 cities across the country.

Conway also said that the protests are “ridiculous,” not only because they’re deliberately disrupting law and order “in a time of great need for the country,” but also because Republicans “never protested against an elected president.” “I get that this is where you’re trying to exercise your right to free speech and all that, but at the end of the day, the only thing you’re doing is you’re overreacting to something that’s perfectly within the president’s legal limitations. President Trump is not breaking any laws whatsoever, so I think everyone just needs to take it down a notch and go back to their normal lives,” President Trump’s adviser opined. “Our country is under threat of nuclear war, this is the last thing we need right now.”

Conway also argued that it was Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) who had a “moral responsibility” to make sure protesters dispersed and went back to their homes, because he is the “best known democratic leader and liberal politician around.” “He seemed so eager to have a job during the election last year, and some of the things he said back then really seemed to resonate with Americans. However, I’m now asking Senator Sanders to put his money where his mouth is and do his part in quelling these pointless and utterly ridiculous protests. People tend to listen to him for some reason, which is why I believe he should do the patriotic thing and help out in this hour of need,” Conway said.

“If I remember correctly, tax policy was one of the staples of Sanders’ political campaign, which is part of the reason why I think he’s the ideal person to talk to the people and explain to them that what Benjamin Franklin said was true – there are only two things that are certain in life, and those are death and taxes,” she argued. “Taxes are a constant and must be paid because they serve the greater good, and one person who’s been certainly paying his share is President Donald Trump. The other part of the reason why Bernie Sanders is the man for the job is the fact that he understands that Republicans have never done anything like this against an elected president.”

“It’s hypocritical to go out there and claim you’re protesting something like this when everybody knows that you just can’t fool the government. North Korea is acting up again, we’re getting ready for war and we need all the funding we can get. Republicans have never done anything like this in the history of our nation, which just goes to show that Democrats are the only disruptive element nowadays. These protesters are almost as crazy as Bernie himself, and that’s why it should be his job and his responsibility to get them off the streets. Should he refuse, I’m afraid he’ll go down in history as the only liberal who’s ever refused to cooperate with a Republican president. And they call us the bad guys,” she concluded."

O’Reilly was away from his show on a “pre-planned” vacation when the announcement was made. “After a thorough and careful review of the allegations, the Company and Bill O’Reilly have agreed that Bill O’Reilly will not be returning to the Fox News Channel,” parent company 21st Century Fox said in a statement Wednesday. The announcement came after six women accused O’Reilly, 67, of inappropriate behavior. A New York Times investigation published April 1 revealed O’Reilly and Fox News had settled with five women for a total of $13 million, while another woman recently came forward with allegations.

Reacting to the news, former half-term governor of Alaska Sarah Palin commented in an interview with portal KnowMyRepublican.com that she was “very excited” to learn that Fox was opening up the position. “Even though I’ve known Bill for many years and have no intention whatsoever of believing a word of the accusations, I still can’t help but feel optimistic about the fact that Fox is now looking for someone to fill his shoes,” Palin said. “As for Bill, I don’t think he’ll be particularly sad about what’s happened, considering he’s done very well for himself and is taken care of financially speaking. The only thing I can think of that could potentially bother him is knowing that he won’t be able to make waves in politics anymore.”

She continued, “On the other hand, regardless of the fact that many new faces are currently being considered to fill the gap, I still have to point out that Fox management should take a look in my direction. As for what it is that makes me qualified to take up his show or a show in that slot, well, I have to say that I’m pretty much the smartest person I know, even though I’m well aware that it sounds like I’m bragging when I say something like that. However, I can assure you that’s not the case. That being said, I don’t think I’m that bad on the eyes either, which, with all due respect to Bill, will certainly be an improvement in the eyes of the viewers.”

“Add then there’s also the fact that there’s absolutely zero risk of me harassing any female employees on the job, since I’m straight. Though, the men better watch out when I’m around, since I know the network has an unofficial tendency to hire both male and female eye-candy exclusively. And like I said, if Fox is looking to trade up from Bill and put a new spin on the program, I’ll be waiting for their call. I know I won’t make the same waves as Bill, but I’ll sure as hell be asking the same tough and awkward questions. And if things get too complicated for the viewers – hey, I’m a not-too-bad-looking woman, it’s all good. Worst case scenario – I’ve never heard of men filing a sexual harassment lawsuit anywhere. It’s a win-win, I’m telling you,” she concluded."

In 2006, Trump told The View that, “if Ivanka weren’t my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.”

Commenting on his statement, the president also said that his daughter’s life is “far from sunshine and rainbows everybody thinks it is.” In an interview with portal KnowMyRepublican.com, President Trump also argued that being rich “is not as easy as it seems,” as well as that “it is 10 times as difficult to be born rich as the son or daughter to rich parents than it is to be born poor and then have to work hard to become rich.” “Most people think these things get easier with time; that couldn’t be farther from the truth,” Trump said.

“As a matter of fact, rich people’s kids suffer way more than any other kids, and that includes homeless people and all that,” he continued. “And I know what you’re going to say: what is this guy on about, is he for real? I’m telling you, when you have nothing, then you have no reason to fight, or argue, or bicker amongst yourselves and with other members of your family. Poverty makes you more connected to your loved ones and strengthens family bonds. Wealth, on the other hand, I’m telling you, it’s more of a curse than a blessing.”

“Take Ivanka, for example. She’s the apple of my eye, but she’s not had an easy life. She has suffered a lot, primarily because of the fact that she’s Donald Trump’s daughter,” Trump said. “There’s a lot of responsibility and obligations that come with being Donald Trump, and there’s no way you can protect your kids from all that. As a matter of fact, sometimes I feel sorry for Ivanka because I look at her and all I can see are those poor Syrian children that are struggling with losing their homes and parents because of the war. That goes especially for refugees; I see what they’re going through and how they’re forced to move along, to forget what little roots they’ve learned they had, and grow up over night.”

“When I think about how much Ivanka had to travel around the world when she was little just so she could spend time with me, it breaks my heart. I remember, I had to overcompensate for my absence by throwing tons of material things at her, things I knew deep down she didn’t want. But I guess that’s what a father does when he’s reduced to his work and nothing more. Make no mistake – my daughter has suffered tremendously even though she grew up well taken care of. But she spent just as much time traveling around, if not more, as those refugee children from Syria. She is one with them because she too lived in over a dozen different countries by the time she was 15. It was not an easy life and that’s why she deserves the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the important work she’s doing for me today,” Trump concluded."
0,http://politicot.com/spicer-trump-legal-right-cancel-scotus-serve-pleasure/,politicono,Spicer: “Trump Has The Legal Right To Cancel SCOTUS Because They Serve At His Pleasure”,['Alex Stevan'],"During a Monday press conference that media outlets were banned from airing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer announced that the president was sending “thoughts and prayers” to the victims of an alleged terrorist attack in London and to the families of seven dead U.S. sailors. Spicer defended the ban on broadcasting the briefing by noting that President Donald Trump had already appeared on camera on Monday for several minutes, although he took no questions. Spicer also said that the president had confidence in all the members of the Justice Department, including Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is reportedly investigating the president for obstruction of justice. He also insisted that Trump has the power to fire Mueller if necessary. “If you serve at the pleasure of the president, you serve at the pleasure of the president,” he said. “That is a fact.”

Asked by several reporters to clarify the full extent of the president’s power, or in other words, its limitations – if they exist – Spicer argued that the Constitution “clearly states” what the President of the United States can and cannot do. “However,” he added, “one must also recognize the fact that our Constitution was written quite a while ago and, as such, isn’t ideal when it comes to facing the issues that plague the American society nowadays. One of those issues is also the limit of the president’s power. Just like our language and many other things that are typically American, our Constitution is also a living thing that changes and evolves as time goes by. And if it doesn’t do so on its own, then it has us, the people of America, to help it. However, seeing how the people already have more than enough on their plate these days, the president has decided not to bother you folks with such boring decisions.”

Spicer continued, “As a result, the president of the country nowadays has very different legal and executive abilities than those of many of his predecessors, especially some of the first ones like George Washington or Thomas Jefferson. As a matter of fact, in order to be able to deal with the problems of today, which vary incredibly compared to ones that existed when the Constitution was written, Donald Trump has incomparably more power than any other president in the history of our country. In other words, there’s a real need to follow the aforementioned ‘if you serve at the pleasure of the president, you serve at the pleasure of the president’ rule. For example, President Trump not only has the power to fire Robert Mueller; he also has the legal ability and right to cancel and disband the Supreme Court of the United States as well, should he feel the need for it. And no one could argue with such a decision.”

“This is something that’s necessary in order to cope with the daily problems and disasters that go with the territory of living in a technologically advanced time. To make things perfectly clear once again: this is not something that’s exclusive to just Donald Trump; whoever succeeds him as president will also have a slightly higher level of power, because this power is linked to the position, not the man in the position. It is today a requirement as much as it is a logical order of events. It is important that we evolve with the times and not be stuck in the past while everyone else goes past us. We need to retain the proactively flexible approach to life that has been our trademark for so long. That goes especially for interpreting the Constitution of the United States,” Spicer concluded."

“I didn’t expect that,” said audience member Jon Baker. “Being here I figured we’d be treated to some wacky, Maury Povich-type stuff. But a real-life, up-close hanging? That’s straight out of a Tarantino flick.”

Cobb at first denied the DNA test results linking him to a Sub-Saharan ancestry, referring to the findings as statistical noise. “Wait a minute, wait a minute, hold on, just wait a minute,” said a frantic Cobb. “Do I look black to you?”

But as host Trisha Goddard moved to fist-bump Cobb while exclaiming “Bro!” Cobb reportedly said that he “could feel the blackness suddenly and uncontrollably creeping up inside of [him],” precipitating a fist-bump reciprocation.

“At that moment he realized it was true,” said Baker. “He was undeniably black. But instead of embracing his heritage, he ran from it. I guess it’s all he knew how to do.”

By this point, NBC had already cut to commercial, providing Baker and fellow audience members with an exclusive, front-row seat to the spectacle that was about to ensue—one that no one attempted to stop.

“He’s a white supremacist, which is pretty much the lowest form of humanity,” continued Baker.

“So we kind of just sat there and let him do his thing. First he created a noose from his shirt and then he stepped on to the chair. Then, well – I don’t think I need to explain the rest.”

Not even members of the white enclave that Cobb helped form in Leith, N.D. felt sympathy for their deceased white supremacist leader."

During an interview that aired on Tuesday, Fox News host Brian Kilmeade asked Ryan to respond to a recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report that said there would be 22 million more people without health insurance by 2026 if the Senate’s version of the health care bill is signed into law. “What they are basically saying at the Congressional Budget Office, if you’re not going to force people to buy Obamacare, if you’re not going to force people to buy something they don’t want, then they won’t buy it,” the Speaker opined. “So, it’s not that people are getting pushed off a plan, it’s that people will choose not to buy something that they don’t like or want.”

Kilmeade then asked Ryan to comment on the fact that the Republican health care platform is going to make health insurance plans significantly less affordable by decreasing subsidies for poorer Americans. Ryan replied by ranting about how being poor is “a choice.” “This is something we’ve been over on more than once occasion,” Ryan said. “I know why you’re asking me this; you want me to feel guilty for depriving 22 million people of health insurance, right? Well, I’m sorry Brian, but it’s not working. And the reason why it’s not working is, you’re using the wrong logic here. You’re using the wrong logic alongside millions of other Americans, because all of you feel that those who get up every day and work hard for some reason owe something to those who just lie around doing nothing. That’s not right.”

“Why should anybody who has the willpower to tackle problems and obstacles in order to provide a good life for themselves and their family be obligated to set aside some of their hard earned money to help other people who don’t want to work hard and, instead, rely on policymakers to ensure they have welfare or, in this case, affordable health insurance?” Ryan opined. “The answer is – they shouldn’t. This is a land of opportunities; but, the thing is, to be able to capitalize on those opportunities, one has to be willing to work hard. And that’s the only condition, working hard. If you work your butt off every single day, you can afford whatever you want, including the best health insurance possible. Now we arrive at my ultimate point: if you choose to work hard, if that’s a choice you make every time you wake up in the morning, then this is something that guarantees your success. But, if you choose to be lazy all day and expect the government to take care of you, then you’re doomed.”

“Being rich or poor is a matter of choice; that’s all there is to it. So, let me ask you this, Brian: if 22 million people consciously make the choice to not work hard day in and day out, why on earth should the rest of us be concerned with whether or not they’re going to be healthy? If they choose to be poor, then it’s their own problem if they can’t afford to be healthy. Think of the message we’d be sending to poor people around the world by nurturing laziness and providing affordable healthcare to poor people. We’d be sending them an open invitation to come here and do nothing. ‘Just come on over and become a U.S. citizen – the government will get you free food, free shelter and free health insurance, and you don’t even have to get a job.’ That’s preposterous, anyone who thinks that’s a good thing deserves to be poor,” he concluded."

Trey Gowdy (R-SC), who is taking over the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform from the departing Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), said on Friday that he will not pursue any investigation into Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election. Politico reports that Gowdy told reporters on Friday that he “wants to return the Oversight panel to its original ‘compulsory’ jurisdiction, including overseeing more mundane issues like government procurement and the Census.” Gowdy also ruled out looking into whether Trump White House adviser Jared Kushner’s security clearance should be revoked.

“I really don’t see the need to pursue that kind of activity anymore,” Gowdy told portal KnowMyRepublican.com in an interview. “There’s no use in gutting the federal budget anymore. In the event that that’s not a good enough reason to stop this, I’ve got a whole list of arguments to support my decision, some of the most obvious being the fact that the election is in the past and what’s done is done, as well as that there were no immediate and incriminating evidence to suggest that there was any interference by Russia or any other nation, for that matter. And then there’s also the fact that, if it did happen, which I’m not saying is the case, but if it did, I’m sure they didn’t mean anything by it.”

Asked to elaborate, Gowdy went on to argue, “Look, let’s make this really simple. If you were dying, heaven forbid, and you needed an emergency blood transfusion or something to keep you alive, and a good Samaritan walked in and helped you in your hour of need, would you go on to press charges and launch an investigation into the good Samaritan once you’ve fully recovered? Of course not, you should be grateful for such a merciful and kind act. Trust me when I say that the situation is no different when it comes to the presidential election and Russia’s alleged involvement. For me to continue this charade of trying to accuse and incriminate someone who, if anything, helped this country by making sure Donald Trump was elected president, would be highly ungrateful and would be equal to spitting our savior in the face.”

“This is a new age we’re living in. The time of the Cold War and communism is over, Russia is not our enemy anymore. There are far greater and more deadly threats out there and we’d be wise to reevaluate who our real friends are. What I’m really trying to say is, without beating around the bush, if Russia really did do something to affect the presidential election in 2016, they were only trying to help. For all intents and purposes, they must have thought they were helping America; they shouldn’t be punished for it. If anything, they need to be applauded and congratulated, because – and I’ll say it again – if they really did do something to help Donald Trump become president, they were doing it because they wanted to help this country and not because it suited some personal, selfish end game of theirs. I have faith in our Russian friends, and so should the people of America,” he concluded."

In a candid interview with Forbes, the younger Trump admitted that nepotism got him into a position in his father’s business. But he says his father handed over the management of the Trump Organization to himself and his brother Don Jr. because of their successes. “Nepotism is kind of a factor in life,” Eric claimed. “We might be here because of nepotism, but we’re not still here because of nepotism. You know, if we didn’t do a good job, if we weren’t competent, believe me, we wouldn’t be in this spot.”

“And besides,” he continued, “if we’re being honest, I have to point out that the fact that I’m being asked this question is kind of borderline offensive. I mean, I understand that my father is not your typical president of the country that comes from politics and all that, but I view that as his advantage instead of the other way around. That being said, do you think it’s fair to suggest that I’m incompetent simply because my father is who he is or because I was born as the son of Donald Trump? At the end of the day, you don’t get to pick your family; the only thing you really get to pick in your life is what you do with it.”

President Trump’s heir also said, “On the other hand, I don’t see other children of wealthy families being asked this question, do you? Therefore, the very fact that I’m being indirectly accused of serving as the head of my father’s business simply because I’m his son is rude in my book. And even if that were true – if I was only his son and nothing else – I could very easily run everything he’s worked so hard for into the ground. But, that’s the thing – that would hurt him and nobody else in this country. As a matter of fact, I think it’s about time we stopped insulting my father and started applauding him for the magnificent work he’s been doing since he became president.”

“You want to talk nepotism? How’s this: if I were the average American, which I still think is an awesome thing to be, I would not only support Donald Trump’s work as the president of the country, but I would also encourage him to hire as many of his family members as the leading team of all his companies and enterprises for one very simple reason,” the president’s eldest son revealed. “Donald Trump is a self-made billionaire who managed to become the president of the greatest country in the world, and did it all thanks to his hard work. As an American, that’s the kind of gene pool I’d want running the country 24/7 if you ask me.”

“I think forgiving and, what’s more, encouraging nepotism in the White House as well as the Trump family is the perfect way Americans can repay my father for the awesome pro-bono work he’s been doing as president so-far. Because, let’s not forget: we’re talking about a billionaire here. Being the President of the United States is all fine and dandy, but waking up in the morning and going for a dip in your very own pool of cash is even better. So, pro-bono work is something my dad has gone to great lengths to achieve and he doesn’t mind doing it. Plus, he’s paid a higher tax rate than former president Obama. Combined with the volunteering he’s doing at the White House, I think that’s as charitable as it gets,” Trump’s son concluded."

Robertson—whose show reaches nearly 1 million viewers a day—said that, since 1969, he’s been wearing an “anti-sodomite” necklace, which, according to Robertson, “repels homosexuals and other queers, and keeps [him] free of their abhorrent lifestyles and gay diseases.”

“With all the gayness poisoning our great nation these days, you might think it’s only by God’s grace that I have managed to remain straight and healthy through it all,” Robertson told his viewers. “But, for once, this was no miracle—I have only my gay-repelling necklace to thank, which has kept all sexual degenerates at least 20 feet away from me for the last 44 years, ever since the stonewall riots convinced me the gays were coming for my heterosexuality.”

Robertson neglected to fully explain the necklace’s powers, revealing only that “it involves hyper-masculine materials, such as moose semen and barbed wire,” but said that he is finally ready to share it with the world. “For only ten easy payments of $59.99, you too can protect yourself from fancy-boy, disease spreading homosexuals,” Robertson said. 700 Club producers expect sales of the necklace to generate substantial funds for the show, which netted over $400 million in donations in 2005 alone.

Robertson’s unveiling came as a response to inquiries concerning comments he made on his show earlier this week. On Tuesday, Robertson used a portion of his show to claim that American homosexuals in cities like San Francisco are intentionally spreading AIDS via “specials rings” that “cut your finger” during handshakes and thereby infect you with the deadly HIV virus. “Really,” the host said. “It’s that kind of vicious stuff, which would be the equivalent of murder.”

“Lots of people wrote in to ask how they can protect themselves from these queer, ring-toting murderers,” Robertson said Thursday. “Well, that made me realize I had to come clean about my anti-gay necklace. It’s time for the world to know.”"

After a full week of testimony, Jones claimed the battle with his ex-wife Kelly for custody of their three children is a “private matter.” However, when Mike Cernovich of Alt-Right recently said that Obama is “basically an absentee father” who has “completely abandoned his daughter who is making her rounds through the New York party scene” during a sit-down with the host, Jones jibed that she has been seen “shaking her ass on TV,” before adding, “The word is those aren’t even his kids.”

Luck would have it that merely days later Jones issued the aforementioned statement, asking members of the press to be considerate and respect his privacy. And then he had the audacity to claim the press should “do what I did” and stay away from the low blows. “Look, what a person does is not necessarily who that person is,” he commented following his post. “Just because I’m the founder of a conspiracy website doesn’t mean that’s who I am in my personal life. I don’t see the need for innocent children to suffer the consequences and get dragged through the mud because of the fact that their father is someone who’s used to a similar treatment.”

He continued, “At the end of the day, former President Obama is no longer at the head of the country, for better or worse. I made it a mission to only target him and never anyone close to him, which I think says a lot about the way I do this job. Similarly, I would ask members of the press to follow in my footsteps and shy away from mentioning the names or any private and personal details regarding my children until such time if or when they themselves choose to go public. I think that every parent understands where I’m coming from with this. I don’t mind being crucified by you guys, I’m used to it by now. But steer clear of my kids, because they don’t deserve what I have coming. They didn’t do anything wrong.”

“I never took a cheap shot at former President Obama; sure, there were blows and call outs like with every politician, but I never targeted anything about him just to make him look bad, and that includes his daughters. I know the difference between fair game and low blows. I would even go so far as to say I’ve never said anything that’s not true or even borderline offensive about his family – other than Michelle, of course, but I don’t think even he considers her family anymore, let alone those who never supported him in the first place. She was okay to target, but like I said – one’s children have been, are and always will be off limits, both politically and in every other way imaginable,” Jones dared to argue."

“It was a rare year when the 3-point competition had as much if not more, intrigue heading into it as the dunk contest because of the notable names who were – and weren’t – participating in each. But LaVine left a lasting impression few will forget.

“The 19-year-old Timberwolves rookie scored a perfect 100 in the opening round. He highlighted his scintillating start with a through-the-legs, one-handed reverse slam. He wore a white No. 23 Jordan jersey for what he dubbed the “Space Jam” dunk.

“For his second dunk of the first round, he tossed the ball up, put it behind his back in the air and threw down a powerful one-handed slam for another 50 from Hall of Fame judges Julius Erving, Walt Frazier, Nate Archibald, Bernard King and Chris Mullin.

“LaVine had a final-round 94 to overtake Orlando’s Victor Oladipo, who struggled to convert his first attempt and finished with a 72 in the championship round. LaVine became the first Timberwolves player to win the dunk contest since Isaiah Rider in 1994. He also became the first player with multiple dunks with perfect scores in the same contest since Dwight Howard in 2009.

“LaVine said: “I’m still on cloud nine. I feel like I’m dreaming. Seeing all the dunk contests and people hoisting the trophy, I just saw myself do it and lived it, so it’s a dream come true. I’m glad my family is here to witness it and go through it.”

“I know everybody loves to joke about how white people can’t jump. I mean, there was even a movie made with the exact same name. But, now that we’re welcoming a new champion, I’d just like to say to all those who agree with the aforementioned phrase – well, maybe white people can’t jump, but Jews can sure dunk,” said Adam Silver, the NBA commissioner. “Jews can and will do a whole lot more for this sport.”"

In fact, 27-year-old Alexandre Bissonnette, the lone suspect in the attack that left six people dead and eight wounded Sunday night, is an anti-Muslim, far-right Trump supporter. Carillo’s tweet links the Sunday night Mosque massacre to Trump’s executive order restricting immigration from several predominantly Muslim countries.

However, in a Tuesday interview with The New York Times, the president’s eldest son argued that the shooter in the Quebec massacre was, in fact, Muslim and that Bissonnette is “being framed.” “I can certainly understand why this is all happening – after all, the political climate is ideal for trying to frame a terrorist attack on a non-Muslim,” Trump Jr. said. He also added that his father’s executive order restricting immigration “was not aimed at Muslims,” but that “unfortunately, that’s what it’s being mistaken for worldwide, and especially in the Middle East.” “As a result, a man is being framed for something he didn’t do. And it’s up to us to shine some light on the matter and make sure that the real culprits are revealed and then punished,” he also said.

Asked to elaborate on whether he has proof that would corroborate his theory in any way, Trump Jr. argued that he’s “sure of it,” because “Christians just aren’t allowed to kill anyone.” “So, you see, it must be that the shooter was a Muslim,” he added. “More precisely – Christians are not allowed to murder anyone. Killing in self-defense and a few other instances is probably okay, though I’m not a man of the church, nor am I a connoisseur when it comes to the Bible, so I can’t really specify what is and isn’t considered a righteous kill, so to speak. But the whole murder thing – yeah, that I’m pretty sure of.”

“On the other hand, if you look at the Muslim world and the Quran, they’ve got the Jihad, the Holy War or whatever it is they’re calling it. So, it’s literally written in their holy scripture that they’re supposed to go after and persecute and murder so-called ‘infidels,’ which is to say non-Muslim individuals,” he asserted. “So, on one hand, you’ve got Christians who are, by default, a peaceful bunch; the whole ‘turn the other cheek’ philosophy and all that. On the other, you’ve got a religion that’s based on exterminating those who don’t agree with it, and they’ve got those orders in writing. How does it happen, then, that the Quebec shooting, which, by the way, happened at a Mosque – a Muslim house of prayer – is being blamed on a non-Muslim?”

“Even a blind person can see that this is a setup, I mean, there are so many movies out there with a similar plot that it’s becoming ridiculous. We ought to be better than this, smarter than this. There is no way in hell the shooter wasn’t Muslim, I’d be willing to stake my life on it. Just take a look at what’s going on in our country for a moment – it’s been almost two weeks since my dad was inaugurated and there haven’t been any racial or religious murders, not one in the whole country. And you want to tell me that has nothing to do with the fact that Barack Hussein Obama, who advocated bringing in more Muslims to America, is no longer president? Come on,” Trump Jr. concluded."

Scott Walker by openly questioning whether President Barack Obama “loves America.”

“The former New York mayor, speaking in front of the 2016 Republican presidential contender and about 60 right-leaning business executives and conservative media types, directly challenged Obama’s patriotism, discussing what he called weak foreign policy decisions and questionable public remarks when confronting terrorists.

““I do not believe, and I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the president loves America,” Giuliani said during the dinner at the 21 Club, a former Prohibition-era speakeasy in midtown Manhattan. “He doesn’t love you. And he doesn’t love me. He wasn’t brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up through love of this country.”

“With Walker sitting just a few seats away, Giuliani continued by saying that “with all our flaws we’re the most exceptional country in the world. I’m looking for a presidential candidate who can express that, do that and carry it out. And if it’s you Scott, I’ll endorse you,” he added. “And if it’s somebody else, I’ll support somebody else.”

“In an interview after the dinner – Walker insisted all of the governor’s comments were off the record – Giuliani said he would “eventually” back a Republican presidential candidate. He also elaborated on his criticism of Obama by arguing the president “sees our weaknesses as footnotes to the great things we’ve done.”

““What country has left so many young men and women dead abroad to save other countries without taking land? This is not the colonial empire that somehow he has in his hand. I’ve never felt that from him. I felt that from [George] W. [Bush]. I felt that from [Bill] Clinton. I felt that from every American president including ones I disagreed with, including [Jimmy] Carter. I don’t feel that from President Obama.”

Asked about his comments in New York, Giuliani told Newslo: “I stand by what I said. I don’t trust that man, I don’t like that man and honestly, I think he’s the worst thing that happened to this country since Pearl Harbor. President Obama doesn’t love America any more than he loves his wife – both of those situations are a no-way-out zone for him. And another thing – I can think of 6,999,999,999 people on this planet who could do a better job as President. I’m just glad to see him go.”"

Giving employers such power is now prohibited by legislation including the 2008 genetic privacy and nondiscrimination law known as GINA. The new bill gets around that landmark law by stating explicitly that GINA and other protections do not apply when genetic tests are part of a “workplace wellness” program. The bill, HR 1313, was approved by a House committee on Wednesday, with all 22 Republicans supporting it and all 17 Democrats opposed.

However, the reason for the bill has less to do with the suspected discrimination of employees based on their genetics, which is to say, ethnicity, and more to do with, apparently, religion. Namely, a source within the committee who requested anonymity, told the Cincinnati Morning Star that the reason why the employer lobby pushed the Republicans into passing the bill was because they were “worried about the religious aspects of their employees’ personal lives, but could not ask them directly, as that would be considered offensive and discriminatory.” Apparently, companies are shifting their focus towards hiring only staff that have a strong connection to their religious side and are God-fearing.

“The moment you have a liberal employee that also happens to be an atheist or something or other, that’s when you know they don’t take their job as seriously as their traditionally-inclined coworkers, which also tends to ruin the work ethic in the office,” the source revealed. “It’s common knowledge that God-fearing workers have an innately different approach to their job; they’re more serious, more hardworking, more productive and, most importantly, are willing to work longer hours compared to their liberal colleagues. All these qualities simply make them the more desirable type of workers to have on the job, especially since everybody’s on about discrimination and equal rights and whatnot these days.”

“Moreover,” the source continued, “there’s also another aspect of God-fearing employees that makes them particularly attractive for companies and businesses. For example, liberal workers also tend to have a disruptive sexual preference and influence on the collective, which can cause a mutiny, let’s put it like that. If you have 9 workers who are God-fearing and traditional and extremely hardworking, and you also have a tenth one who’s an atheist and also happens to be homosexual, that’s something that can very easily bring about a whole lot of problems for you as an employer, and especially for the 9 workers who don’t want to work in that sort of environment.”

“That’s why it’s important for companies to have insight into the results of their employees’ genetic tests, so they can see right off the bat which of them are at the risk of becoming disruptive and disobedient. As an employer, you want a homogenous structure of workers to be handling challenges on a daily basis. If you have one or several of them who keep making waves and pissing off the rest of the guys and you realize you have to fire them for it, you’re at risk of being sued for discrimination, mobbing or whatever. This is just a simple way to avoid getting into a situation like that,” the source concluded."

Speaking to Bryan Fischer, formerly of the American Family Association recently, Carl Kerby insisted it wasn’t infeasible for the giant reptilian creatures to have been on Noah’s Ark.

“The self-described “creation scientist” said he had debunked the notion that two of every animal could not have possibly fit on Noah’s Ark. The Bible states that the boat was about 450 feet long, 75 feet wide and 50 feet high, Kerby explained.

““I see some people that like to mock and ridicule, especially about the dinosaurs, how did they put the big old dinosaurs on there?” he said. “Well, I would suggest to you they didn’t take the big old dinosaur – they would have taken the younger ones.

You think of a guy like me, if you’re going to go repopulate a planet, you’re not taking me with you. My repopulating days are done. You take my son or my grandson. My grandson is a whole lot smaller than I am.”

“Creationists believe that the Flood began approximately 4,359 years ago. Scientists have found that dinosaurs were extinct by the end of the Cretaceous Period about 65 million years ago."

A. You better be here legally or you’re out of here. B. When you’re here, let’s speak American,’” Palin told CNN’s Jake Tapper in an interview that aired on “State of the Union” recently. “I mean, that’s just – let’s speak English and that’s kind of a unifying aspect of a nation – the language that is understood by all.”

“Let me tell you what happened to me the other day while I was in the supermarket,” Palin said during the interview. “I was in there, doing my regular shopping like any other day, and I remember I couldn’t find the type of cereal I normally buy all the time, so I asked the guy who was filling the shelves next to me if he would be kind enough to check whether they had some more in storage out in the back. And that’s when it all started.”

The former half-term Governor of Alaska then went on to tell the story of how pretty soon, the entire supermarket “echoed in the shouts of foreign employees talking to each other in their native language,” and how “I suddenly felt like I was in a completely foreign country.” “I mean, I couldn’t even tell what the language was, it sounded kind of Arabic, but at the same time, it wasn’t. Finally, I was able to get my cereal after 15 or so minutes of this non-English communication, and I left the supermarket in a state of shock.”

“Then I got to thinking – if we have people like these working in our grocery stores, and these people are handling something as important as our food, which is our daily sustenance – what’s to stop them from doing whatever they want to it? I mean, they could be polluting it by mishandling, they could be dropping meat and vegetables on the floor and picking it up and selling it as if nothing had happened. And even worse – they are actually touching all of our food with their hands, and God only knows how or if at all they look after their personal hygiene. I had a real epiphany, I can tell you,” Palin argued.

“Honestly, I’m starting to feel like a minority in my own country,” Palin said. “I’m starting to listen to English being driven out from more and more communities, and foreign languages spoken at an increasing level, especially Arabic and Spanish. Well, it’s time to put our foot down and set things right. This is America, the greatest country in the world and American is the only language that gets to be spoken here. I don’t care what anyone says – either learn it or go back home!”

She also added, “Because, if we let immigrants keep their native cultures, traditions and languages, we’re then allowing them to refuse to become assimilated into the American society. We are, thereby, effectively denying them the very thing that makes an American what they are. And furthermore, you’ve seen the situation we’re faced with in our supermarkets and in many other crucial places and positions throughout our economy and, more importantly, everyday lives. Are we just going to sit idly by and let our culture be usurped?”

“Hell no!” she shouted, before continuing, “and I’m here to tell you that American is the language that everybody in this country is going to have to use 24/7, the way it’s been done for thousands of years on this territory. Even Native Americans today speak our language, and they were, kind of, here before us. Just goes to show you don’t want to mess with Uncle Sam or else Uncle Sam is going to start messing with your native country, and it’s probably going to include nukes of some sort. Just ask Japanese-Americans.”"

No hope!” he also added. But, according to “his son, Tea-Party favorite and Texas Senator, Ted Cruz, Rafael Sr. was “misinterpreted.”

“Lies, all lies,” Ted Cruz told Newslo furiously, and added, “I could never understand what someone would gain by twisting the words of a poor old man.”

However, it would appear that Cruz Jr. is once again caught red-handed, trying to manipulate the public opinion. “Namely, the incident in question took place at an Oklahoma Second Amendment advocacy group in Earslboro, Oklahoma in 2013. Rafael Cruz spoke against secular humanism and atheism, claiming that “the belief systems are two of the main ills facing our society, that they lead to sexual abuse, sexual perversion and a complete loss of hope.”

However, Cruz Sr. didn’t stop there. He added that “people following these two views should be rounded up and placed in special “camps” to keep them separated from the rest of America.”

His son recently spoke exclusively to Newslo and expressed his anger over the fact that “his father’s words were intentionally twisted for the purpose of hurting his [Ted Cruz’s] 2016 presidential run.”

“I can certainly see how someone could easily believe everything that was said about my dad, but the fact to the matter is that he’s an older gentleman and sometimes he slips up when he speaks emotionally. What he actually meant to say was that atheists should be rounded up for camping, not into camps. He meant this as a way to help those poor people find their way in religion on a camping trip, instead of aimlessly and ungratefully spending their days on God’s green earth,” Cruz explained.

He added: “I get angry when I see all kinds of headlines on the internet and press, claiming that my father said this and that; I just don’t get why people do such things to us. It’s the same with me and gay marriage – I’m not even going to comment on that.”

“An avowed creationist and an evangelical preacher in his time, who had claimed in the past that God endorses the death penalty, Cruz Sr. also spoke aloud about evolution being a communist trick aimed at converting people to atheism, that President Obama is a tyrant who needs to go back to Kenya, and that legalizing gay marriage will lead to preachers being arrested for hate speech just for reading the Bible."

“Worley believes that placing gays in camps will ensure homosexuality dies out since gays “don’t reproduce.” Worley isn’t apologizing for his sermon, saying: “We offer NO apologies in believing the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible is the inerrant Word of God. If you live in this area or are ever passing through, I invite you to come visit us at Providence Road Baptist Church.”

Commenting on his fiery statements, the pastor added that “anti-gay camps might not even be enough to contain and annihilate the evil of homosexuality that plagues the Earth.”

“When I really think about it more thoroughly, holding camps and electric fences are a decent enough solution, but they might take too long. Not to mention all that extra time on their hands will give the queers ample opportunity to savor in their blasphemy and sodomy. No, what we really need is something much faster, much more efficient and brutal. Wait a minute,” the pastor shouted, “I got it! Gimme just a sec,” he stated and pulled out his cell phone right in the middle of the interview.

“Hey Chris, how are you doing? How’s everything in New Jersey?” the pastor inquired, leading Newslo’s interviewer to the obvious conclusion that the person on the other side of the line was, in fact, the Governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie. “Say, how’s that women’s Viagra pill deal working out? Uh-huh? That good? And any news on the anti-lesbian vaccine? Great, great. Listen, Chris, I just got a killer idea – have you ever thought about an anti-gay vaccine? I know, sounds epic, right? Look, set the wheels in motion and I’ve got the market and guinea pigs already set up on my end, don’t worry about it. Keep me posted. Talk later.”

After some 2 minutes, the pastor tucked away his cell phone, got back on his seat and with a notable smile on his face said, “Where were we? Ah, yes – methods more efficient than holding camps for gays. Well, you just heard what I’m up to. I really think that an anti-gay vaccine would do the job quite nicely, and I’m not just talking about the short-term effects. No, I think the best thing to do is nip the problem in the bud. Instead of just gays, we’ll administer the vaccine to pregnant women in order to minimize the chances of gay babies being born. That won’t only lead to fewer gays, but it will also result in fewer AIDS cases. I mean, after all, everybody knows that gays are the most responsible for the spike in HIV cases in recent years, especially in the U.S.”

Asked if an anti-gay vaccine would really work considering the ethical issues that are obviously involved, the pastor replied: “Of course it would. It will. It has to. I mean, instead of developing our own brand, we can always import the Russian or Chinese version, but like our problems, I like our solutions to be ‘Made in America’ as well.”"

Palin, 24, said on her blog that Meyer, 26, proposed to her at a Rascal Flatts concert in Las Vegas. “The lead singer, Gary LeVox, dedicated ‘Bless the Broken Road’ to us, and then Dakota got down on one knee and proposed!” she wrote. “It’s amazing to see what happens when you place everything in life in God’s hands.”

“Friends and well-wishers congratulated the couple on the news. As one person said in a comment on Meyer’s Instagram, “This is so ‘MERICA that my mind is blown right now.” Meyer received the nation’s highest military honor for braving enemy fire in 2009 to recover 36 American and Afghan troops in Afghanistan. He was the third living recipient – and the first Marine – to be awarded the Medal of Honor for actions in Iraq and Afghanistan.

“Palin, the oldest daughter of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, has stayed in the public eye since her mother’s failed vice presidential bid through appearances on “Dancing with the Stars” and a Lifetime show about raising her son, “Bristol Palin: Life’s a Tripp.” She also released a best-selling memoir in 2011, “Not Afraid of Life: My Journey So Far.” She was previously engaged to Tripp’s father, Levi Johnston.

“The couple met last year when Meyer visited Alaska to film “Amazing America,” Sarah Palin’s show on Sportsman Channel, Bristol Palin said in her blog post. “He met Tripp during that time, and I’ve seen him in a few places where our paths have crossed since. He’s visited us in Alaska, and I’ve visited his wonderful family in Kentucky,” she wrote. “He’s wonderful with Trip and I’m so proud to be marrying him.” The couple shared news of their engagement on social media. “I’m definitely the luckiest guy ever,” Meyer said in an Instagram of the pair tagged #shesaidyes.

However, Sarah Palin wouldn’t be who she is without a snappy comment or, in this case, interview. She exclusively told Newslo that it is an “honor to welcome a Medal of Honor recipient into the family as a son-in-law, but that things would be even better if he wasn’t a democrat.”

“Truth be told, the idea of Bristol marrying someone who’s not a Republican has never crossed my mind, but she’s a big girl now and I’d like to believe she knows what she’s doing. However, although I sort of have a habit of not getting along with Democrats, I’m willing to make an exception in my daughter’s case,” Palin said. “There are always several ways of looking at things, and I know I should be grateful for her choice of husband. After all, things could have gone differently – I could have ended up with a gay son-in-law, or worse: a gay and a Democrat. Had that happened, I would have been done for.”"

The problem was not in reigniting the American strive to achieve planetary travel or even Trump’s inability to understand Buzz Aldrin’s “Toy Story” quite during his speech. The concern many found was that the president seemed to misunderstand what exactly “space” was. “At some point in the future, we’re going to look back and say how did we do it without space?” Trump asked, as if “space” was one of the scientists on the team. Aldrin’s response was obvious and caught on camera.

Needless to say, the gaffe once again lit up the social media and internet, causing a plethora of comments mocking the president’s inability to hold his own even when it comes to reading a pre-prepared speech. In reaction to the mockery, President Trump lashed out against Aldrin, who made history as being the second man to set foot on the Moon, right after Neil Armstrong. Speaking with portal KnowMyRepublican.com, he said that “it’s a shame people are still having trouble understanding how far fake news go and how long they’ve been around.” He added, “They say I’m ridiculous, but at least I understand what’s going on in this country, unlike some people.”

The president continued, “I had no intention of bringing this up today, but this whole fake news business is really turning into a global conspiracy that’s threatening to set back every single positive thing I’ve done for this country so far. Let me tell you, at first, I was alright with it – as much as one can be alright with something like that – because they were going after me and I’m the president and that’s okay. But it’s only recently that I’ve begun to comprehend the full extent of the lies some people are ready to believe in this country. I’ll also say that, for the greatest country in the world, some of our citizens are pretty gullible. This whole landing on the Moon business is a good example. No way did that happen, especially not back then.”

“If you actually believe we had the technology and resources to send two men to land on the Moon in the 1960s, then you really ought to go and get your head checked out,” Trump added. “It was all fake news, even back then. As a matter of fact, one could say that’s how fake news started in the first place, because the government back then needed something grand to make sure people would continue believing the top political establishment, so they made up the story that these two guys went and walked on the Moon. Let me tell you, if I was the head of NASA, especially back then, there’s a billion other people I’d rather choose for the mission over this Aldrin guy. He’s not a winner, he’s nothing. It’s ridiculous.”

“I mean, he trains all his life to become an astronaut, gets chosen for the epic, historical mission, somehow manages to get up there successfully and then doesn’t have the brass to go out in front of Armstrong and cement his place in history as being the first guy to set foot on the Moon? I mean, come on, that’s idiotic. Every single one of us would have jumped at the chance to do something that monumental and important. And you’re trying to tell me that, not only was he up there, but that he also had the decency and good manners to let someone else go down in history as number 1? You’re telling me he was up there and still willingly agreed to be number 2? And I’m supposed to respect and take insults from that guy, from the number 2? Come on, be serious. There’s no way I’m putting up with that liar. There was no evidence whatsoever that he came close to the Moon, let alone walked on it,” Trump concluded."

Joan Walsh wrote on AlterNet: “Read and decide for yourself if this war on women is imaginary:”

““Democrats didn’t make the GOP presidential field back “personhood” laws that would criminalize some forms of birth control. They didn’t force the newly elected house GOP to make defunding Planned Parenthood their first legislative goal. And they didn’t propose the Blunt Amendment that would have allowed employers to withhold health insurance coverage not only for contraception, but for any treatment they disapproved of.”

Furthermore, it would seem that Cathy McMorris Rogers isn’t the only Republican waging a crusade against her own sex. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, famous for his sharp tongue and conservative political views, seems to have joined McMorris Rogers in their party’s obvious war on women in America.

Christie recently addressed the rumors that pharmaceutical companies are extensively researching a Viagra pill for women. The New Jersey governor allegedly denied that such a pill would have numerous benefits for women in a televised interview and verbally attacked the host for asking him such “offensive and idiotic questions.” When asked to comment on the incident by Newslo, Christie said: “Oh no, I really feel like women could use a Viagra pill. Like we don’t have enough dykes already.”

Asked to elaborate on his offensive language, the anything-but-subtle Republican stated that “the only thing such a pill would do for the women of the world is get them to change their sexual orientation.”

“The men of today already have enough trouble satisfying women as it is. Why do you think Viagra was invented in the first place? But no, let’s amplify women’s sex drive even further, that’ll definitely help them feel more satisfied and relaxed. And who are they going to turn to quench that thirst? Other women. Men aren’t machines, but neither are they. They just haven’t realized it yet,” Christie concluded."

He’s set to embark on his first official trip overseas Friday with pit stops in Saudi Arabia, Israel, Belgium, Italy and the Vatican – something he’s reportedly pouting about, huffing and puffing that the nine-day excursion is far too long. Worse yet: none of the places he’s visiting have a Trump-branded hotel with workers that are duty-bound and practiced at serving him his favorite meals. Trump is a noted lover of fast food: McDonald’s burgers and Kentucky fried chicken are staples. “The Big Macs are great. The Quarter Pounder. It’s great stuff,” he said in a town hall event about his orders from McDonald’s.

However, there might be trouble on the upcoming trip, as a source within the White House leaked information that the president is “reluctant” when it comes to visiting Israel, because he’s not convinced he’ll like the food there. “I wouldn’t say he’s scared, because he doesn’t get scared, he’s not the type. But there’s an apprehensiveness about him whenever anyone from the staff mentions the fact that he’s scheduled to visit the place,” the source, who requested anonymity, told portal KnowMyRepublican.com. “From what I understand, they’ve tried to explain to him several times that he can have anything he wants custom prepared for him and then brought in especially tailored to his requests, but for some reason, he just doesn’t want to hear of it. From what I could gather, the staff are puzzled by this as they didn’t expect it to turn into that big of a problem.”

The source continued, “I recently had a talk about it with someone very close to him, and it seems that the reason why he’s so reluctant to keep Israel on the list of visits is because, as you know, the president is a huge fan of fast food, and he’s particularly fond of McDonald’s. However, because of the cultural and religious differences, the company tailors their restaurants to accommodate the desires of the population in any given region where it conducts business. That’s why, for example, McDonald’s restaurants throughout Europe look nothing like the ones we have here. The same applies to those in Israel; they are literally completely different from any other McDonald’s restaurant – one could even argue that they’re unique. Their ingredients come from different sources and they also have different traditions when it comes to the types of meat they use.”

“Ultimately, my source tells me that the president is even threatening to cancel his visit to Israel because the McDonald’s restaurants there don’t have a bacon cheese Big Mac, which is a favorite of his. He’s apparently demanding the staff to make arrangements to somehow provide them for the duration of his visit. I don’t need to tell you that the staff are very frustrated and worried about not being able to accomplish that. So much so, in fact, that I’m also told they’ve started contacting the McDonald’s headquarters and begging the management to accommodate the president’s request. I am yet to learn of the outcome of that plead, but it gives you an idea of how spoiled Donald Trump really is. At the end of the day, i personally think they’ll figure out a way to make it happen, because everybody knows Donald Trump is not a man you want to disappoint,” the source concluded."

Palin’s latest crusade puts her in the middle of the battle to protect the heart of Christmas. “We were founded as written in our chapters of liberty, in the documents that created America,” Palin said. “We’re founded on a Judeo-Christian faith that would allow forever the right to express or respect for faith in America.” Palin also told CBN News that her book, Good Tidings and Great Joy: Protecting the Heart of Christmas, is a rallying cry for Christians to stand up against those who want to keep faith out of the public square.

Apparently, the Union of Alaskan Prostitutes, an organization dedicated to offering physical protection and legal representation to the working girls of Alaska, agrees with its former half-term governor completely. In accordance with their position on the apparent liberal, corporate war on Christmas in America, the Union has decided to offer a 50% discount to all Republicans as a way of supporting their fight against the destruction of the holiest of Christian holidays. “We thought long and hard about what we could do to help out in the fight against war on Christmas, and since we’ve always been a proactive organization, we came up with this idea on one of our monthly meetings,” Sheila Plumpbottom, the Union’s spokeswoman and former employee, told CBN News.

Plumpbottom also argued that “offering money or other monetary or physical forms of contribution” would not represent an honest mix between the spirit of giving that is Christmas and the Union’s own business, which is why they decided to help out in their own, unique way. “Part of the reason why we went with this type of solution was the fact that there’s a lot of stress going on in today’s world, especially with the technology that’s alienating people and pornography that’s changing everything,” the spokeswoman said, adding that since the premiere of the Apple iPhone in 2007, the Union has recorded a massive decrease in business, which led them to the conclusion that “more and more people have started masturbating at home and watching porn on their smartphones. They couldn’t be bothered anymore to go out and pick up a working girl like they did in the old days,” she deduced.

That’s why the Union has decided to re-brand and offer a special discount coupon to all those interested in hiring their services and supporting Republican politicians’ war on Christmas-haters. “All they have to do is use the coupon with the words ‘whore-on-xmas’ and they’ll pay 50% off the regular price. We’re also thinking about other ways to contribute to the cause, but we’d first like to gauge how well this is going,” Plumpbottom added. “Republican politicians are hard-working, traditional, conservative Americans, and such men and women in today’s times are in the minority compared to liberals who tolerate everything and everyone. We simply want to help Republicans relieve all that stress. Our girls are very talented, drop-dead gorgeous and more than willing to take some of the load, if you know what I mean,” the spokeswoman concluded."

At 4 p.m. sharp, Arpaio and a member of his Sheriff’s Office’s Cold Case Posse had a message for the 40-odd journalists in attendance: You were wrong. Arpaio and his aides announced that a five-year probe had proved that Obama’s birth certificate from Hawaii in 1961 was, in fact, a forgery.

“There are very few new things about this theory, which, as you can see, is not just a theory anymore,” Arpaio told reporters. “We were adamant and we persevered and now we can say with absolute certainty that so-called president Barack Obama’s birth certificate, which he falsely produced in 2011, is in fact, fake. And like I said – there ain’t much new developments there, I’m sure even many of you had their doubts. But, the reason why this is so important is the fact that this confirmation has some pretty big consequences.”

Asked to elaborate, the Maricopa County Sheriff told reporters that this “changes things drastically” in the transition between the President-elect Donald Trump and current President Obama. “And here’s what I mean,” he proceeded to explain. “Since Barack Obama is not a legal citizen of the United States, he does not, according to our Constitution, have the right to run for any political office. Therefore, he should not have been able to run for the presidency back in 2008, and least of all win and become president. I’m sorry to admit it, dear people of America, but we’ve been living a lie for the past 8 years.”

He continued, “And since he should not have been able to do everything aforementioned, the presidency should have, by default, gone to his counter-candidate, which at the time was Sen. John McCain. However and furthermore, since Sen. McCain is too old to assume office right now, and since that would put an enormous strain on his health at this time, I call for Sarah Palin to become acting President of the United States temporarily, until such time when Donald Trump will be inaugurated and assume his full duties as President.”

Asked to explain why he wanted Sarah Palin, the former half-term Alaska governor, to fill in for McCain, Arpaio stated the obvious. “What kind of question is that?” he asked the reporter back. “Do you now know who John McCain’s running mate was back in 2008? Since you obviously don’t, I’ll tell you: it was Sarah Palin. And so it makes sense that we call her and ask her to do her duty for her country. Who else did you expect us to call, Hillary Clinton? The woman lost miserably to Obama for the Democratic nomination back then – a fact that is even more shameful now that it’s clear Barack Obama was a foreign imposter, and quite possibly a Muslim spy. And as if that wasn’t enough, she lost to Donald Trump yet again this November. She doesn’t seem to want to except the huge ‘NO’ Americans keep throwing in her face.”

“And as for the imposter Obama, I move that he be arrested and taken to interrogation to figure out who he’s really working for and who has been ordering him to run the American economy into the ground, allow same-sex marriage and ruin our healthcare. I have a feeling it was either the ragheads, the Chinese or maybe Putin. I don’t think it was the North Koreans, however, since they wouldn’t find sand on a beach, let alone infiltrate a black spy into the U.S. My money’s on the Saudis, because of the religious thing, but we’ll see. I know for a fact President Trump is pro-waterboarding, so it’s just a matter of time,” Arpaio concluded."

Fiorina is reportedly being considered for the role of director of national intelligence. “It was an honor to meet the president-elect,” Fiorina told reporters before praising the “really cool” sports memorabilia in Trump’s office. “I was particularly taken by Shaq O’Neill’s shoe,” she explained. “I guess it takes a champion to know a champion.”

Asked to elaborate on the sudden change in her relationship with the President-elect, she argued that he’s “a man who stops at nothing when it comes to realizing his goals,” but that he also “has no problem communicating with yesterday’s enemies about tomorrow’s opportunities.” “And I’ll be the first one to admit that I stand corrected,” she added. “Donald Trump is a great man by anyone’s standards and there’s no way anyone in their right mind would turn down an opportunity to work with him, especially now.”

The former Hewlett-Packard CEO also argued that, regardless of their past differences, she “doesn’t resent him,” but in fact, has “started celebrating the fact that he is our new President.” “You don’t go hating on the man who has so much in common with a sports giant such as Shaquille O’Neal,” she said. “They’ve both had some rough times and both came out on top of the situation. And what’s more important – both of them beat their respective black mambas. That fact alone proves that Donald Trump is exactly where he’s supposed to be at this time.”

Asked who she’s referring to as the billionaire businessman’s black mamba, Fiorina said, “Do I really need to spell it out for you? It was a figure of speech, but the fact that our former president is of Kenyan descent should have made it pretty obvious. Anyway, if you recall, both O’Neal and Trump were ridiculed by their respective opponents on and off the court. And at the end of it all, both men came out victorious, each in his respective field. So, bottom line, I don’t care how much you hate Donald Trump – you just don’t have any arguments left to hate him. He’s good for this country and you know it.”

“As a matter of fact,” Fiorina continued, “the two are so much alike in some aspects that I’ve wondered if perhaps they share some genes or something. Other than their skin color and ridiculously different shoe size, both Shaquille O’Neal and Donald Trump are basically the same person. They’re winners, they never back down and they’re hugely successful, self-made men. Although, if I were Donald Trump and was thinking about deporting all black people back to Africa, I’d be slightly worried. After all, deporting complete strangers is one thing, but deporting family? That’s a whole other ballpark. Aside from not being very nice, it might cost him his second term,” she concluded."
0,http://politicono.com/palin-calls-boycott-mall-america-santa-always-white-bible/,politicono,Sarah Palin Calls To Boycott Mall Of America Because “Santa Was Always White In The Bible”,['Lea Vat Kens'],"The announcement that Mall of America was welcoming its first black Santa Claus was greeted in many quarters as a good thing but, as might be expected in a country that has become increasingly more comfortable saying any racist thing that comes to mind, many were highly offended. Three years after Fox’s Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors.

Among many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the company’s actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and “running Mall of America into the ground,” on the basis of Santa “always having been white in the Bible.” “No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,” Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.

She also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was “the last straw” in corporate America’s twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, “because they realized they couldn’t make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques they’ve been using so far.” She added, “That’s why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they won’t shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I don’t understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that.”

“That’s why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again,” Palin added. “The Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we don’t, if we let them get away with it, what’s next? Others will follow their example and the next thing we know, we’re going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights. I mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think that’s happening by accident?”

“Nope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white Christianity. The numbers of converts to Islam have also spiked, just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups. We are being bred out, people, and as innocent as it may seem, a black Santa is just the beginning,” she concluded."

A. You better be here legally or you’re out of here. B. When you’re here, let’s speak American,’” Palin told CNN’s Jake Tapper in an interview that aired on “State of the Union” recently. “I mean, that’s just – let’s speak English and that’s kind of a unifying aspect of a nation – the language that is understood by all.”

“Let me tell you what happened to me the other day while I was in the supermarket,” Palin said during the interview. “I was in there, doing my regular shopping like any other day, and I remember I couldn’t find the type of cereal I normally buy all the time, so I asked the guy who was filling the shelves next to me if he would be kind enough to check whether they had some more in storage out in the back. And that’s when it all started.”

The former half-term Governor of Alaska then went on to tell the story of how pretty soon, the entire supermarket “echoed in the shouts of foreign employees talking to each other in their native language,” and how “I suddenly felt like I was in a completely foreign country.” “I mean, I couldn’t even tell what the language was, it sounded kind of Arabic, but at the same time, it wasn’t. Finally, I was able to get my cereal after 15 or so minutes of this non-English communication, and I left the supermarket in a state of shock.”

“Then I got to thinking – if we have people like these working in our grocery stores, and these people are handling something as important as our food, which is our daily sustenance – what’s to stop them from doing whatever they want to it? I mean, they could be polluting it by mishandling, they could be dropping meat and vegetables on the floor and picking it up and selling it as if nothing had happened. And even worse – they are actually touching all of our food with their hands, and God only knows how or if at all they look after their personal hygiene. I had a real epiphany, I can tell you,” Palin argued.

“Honestly, I’m starting to feel like a minority in my own country,” Palin said. “I’m starting to listen to English being driven out from more and more communities, and foreign languages spoken at an increasing level, especially Arabic and Spanish. Well, it’s time to put our foot down and set things right. This is America, the greatest country in the world and American is the only language that gets to be spoken here. I don’t care what anyone says – either learn it or go back home!”

She also added, “Because, if we let immigrants keep their native cultures, traditions and languages, we’re then allowing them to refuse to become assimilated into the American society. We are, thereby, effectively denying them the very thing that makes an American what they are. And furthermore, you’ve seen the situation we’re faced with in our supermarkets and in many other crucial places and positions throughout our economy and, more importantly, everyday lives. Are we just going to sit idly by and let our culture be usurped?”

“Hell no!” she shouted, before continuing, “and I’m here to tell you that American is the language that everybody in this country is going to have to use 24/7, the way it’s been done for thousands of years on this territory. Even Native Americans today speak our language, and they were, kind of, here before us. Just goes to show you don’t want to mess with Uncle Sam or else Uncle Sam is going to start messing with your native country, and it’s probably going to include nukes of some sort. Just ask Japanese-Americans.”"

No hope!” he also added. But, according to “his son, Tea-Party favorite and Texas Senator, Ted Cruz, Rafael Sr. was “misinterpreted.”

“Lies, all lies,” Ted Cruz told Newslo furiously, and added, “I could never understand what someone would gain by twisting the words of a poor old man.”

However, it would appear that Cruz Jr. is once again caught red-handed, trying to manipulate the public opinion. “Namely, the incident in question took place at an Oklahoma Second Amendment advocacy group in Earslboro, Oklahoma in 2013. Rafael Cruz spoke against secular humanism and atheism, claiming that “the belief systems are two of the main ills facing our society, that they lead to sexual abuse, sexual perversion and a complete loss of hope.”

However, Cruz Sr. didn’t stop there. He added that “people following these two views should be rounded up and placed in special “camps” to keep them separated from the rest of America.”

His son recently spoke exclusively to Newslo and expressed his anger over the fact that “his father’s words were intentionally twisted for the purpose of hurting his [Ted Cruz’s] 2016 presidential run.”

“I can certainly see how someone could easily believe everything that was said about my dad, but the fact to the matter is that he’s an older gentleman and sometimes he slips up when he speaks emotionally. What he actually meant to say was that atheists should be rounded up for camping, not into camps. He meant this as a way to help those poor people find their way in religion on a camping trip, instead of aimlessly and ungratefully spending their days on God’s green earth,” Cruz explained.

He added: “I get angry when I see all kinds of headlines on the internet and press, claiming that my father said this and that; I just don’t get why people do such things to us. It’s the same with me and gay marriage – I’m not even going to comment on that.”

“An avowed creationist and an evangelical preacher in his time, who had claimed in the past that God endorses the death penalty, Cruz Sr. also spoke aloud about evolution being a communist trick aimed at converting people to atheism, that President Obama is a tyrant who needs to go back to Kenya, and that legalizing gay marriage will lead to preachers being arrested for hate speech just for reading the Bible."

“Worley believes that placing gays in camps will ensure homosexuality dies out since gays “don’t reproduce.” Worley isn’t apologizing for his sermon, saying: “We offer NO apologies in believing the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible is the inerrant Word of God. If you live in this area or are ever passing through, I invite you to come visit us at Providence Road Baptist Church.”

Commenting on his fiery statements, the pastor added that “anti-gay camps might not even be enough to contain and annihilate the evil of homosexuality that plagues the Earth.”

“When I really think about it more thoroughly, holding camps and electric fences are a decent enough solution, but they might take too long. Not to mention all that extra time on their hands will give the queers ample opportunity to savor in their blasphemy and sodomy. No, what we really need is something much faster, much more efficient and brutal. Wait a minute,” the pastor shouted, “I got it! Gimme just a sec,” he stated and pulled out his cell phone right in the middle of the interview.

“Hey Chris, how are you doing? How’s everything in New Jersey?” the pastor inquired, leading Newslo’s interviewer to the obvious conclusion that the person on the other side of the line was, in fact, the Governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie. “Say, how’s that women’s Viagra pill deal working out? Uh-huh? That good? And any news on the anti-lesbian vaccine? Great, great. Listen, Chris, I just got a killer idea – have you ever thought about an anti-gay vaccine? I know, sounds epic, right? Look, set the wheels in motion and I’ve got the market and guinea pigs already set up on my end, don’t worry about it. Keep me posted. Talk later.”

After some 2 minutes, the pastor tucked away his cell phone, got back on his seat and with a notable smile on his face said, “Where were we? Ah, yes – methods more efficient than holding camps for gays. Well, you just heard what I’m up to. I really think that an anti-gay vaccine would do the job quite nicely, and I’m not just talking about the short-term effects. No, I think the best thing to do is nip the problem in the bud. Instead of just gays, we’ll administer the vaccine to pregnant women in order to minimize the chances of gay babies being born. That won’t only lead to fewer gays, but it will also result in fewer AIDS cases. I mean, after all, everybody knows that gays are the most responsible for the spike in HIV cases in recent years, especially in the U.S.”

Asked if an anti-gay vaccine would really work considering the ethical issues that are obviously involved, the pastor replied: “Of course it would. It will. It has to. I mean, instead of developing our own brand, we can always import the Russian or Chinese version, but like our problems, I like our solutions to be ‘Made in America’ as well.”"

Palin, 24, said on her blog that Meyer, 26, proposed to her at a Rascal Flatts concert in Las Vegas. “The lead singer, Gary LeVox, dedicated ‘Bless the Broken Road’ to us, and then Dakota got down on one knee and proposed!” she wrote. “It’s amazing to see what happens when you place everything in life in God’s hands.”

“Friends and well-wishers congratulated the couple on the news. As one person said in a comment on Meyer’s Instagram, “This is so ‘MERICA that my mind is blown right now.” Meyer received the nation’s highest military honor for braving enemy fire in 2009 to recover 36 American and Afghan troops in Afghanistan. He was the third living recipient – and the first Marine – to be awarded the Medal of Honor for actions in Iraq and Afghanistan.

“Palin, the oldest daughter of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, has stayed in the public eye since her mother’s failed vice presidential bid through appearances on “Dancing with the Stars” and a Lifetime show about raising her son, “Bristol Palin: Life’s a Tripp.” She also released a best-selling memoir in 2011, “Not Afraid of Life: My Journey So Far.” She was previously engaged to Tripp’s father, Levi Johnston.

“The couple met last year when Meyer visited Alaska to film “Amazing America,” Sarah Palin’s show on Sportsman Channel, Bristol Palin said in her blog post. “He met Tripp during that time, and I’ve seen him in a few places where our paths have crossed since. He’s visited us in Alaska, and I’ve visited his wonderful family in Kentucky,” she wrote. “He’s wonderful with Trip and I’m so proud to be marrying him.” The couple shared news of their engagement on social media. “I’m definitely the luckiest guy ever,” Meyer said in an Instagram of the pair tagged #shesaidyes.

However, Sarah Palin wouldn’t be who she is without a snappy comment or, in this case, interview. She exclusively told Newslo that it is an “honor to welcome a Medal of Honor recipient into the family as a son-in-law, but that things would be even better if he wasn’t a democrat.”

“Truth be told, the idea of Bristol marrying someone who’s not a Republican has never crossed my mind, but she’s a big girl now and I’d like to believe she knows what she’s doing. However, although I sort of have a habit of not getting along with Democrats, I’m willing to make an exception in my daughter’s case,” Palin said. “There are always several ways of looking at things, and I know I should be grateful for her choice of husband. After all, things could have gone differently – I could have ended up with a gay son-in-law, or worse: a gay and a Democrat. Had that happened, I would have been done for.”"

I mean, I understand that my father is not your typical president of the country that comes from politics and all that, but I view that as his advantage instead of the other way around. That being said, do you think it’s fair to suggest that I’m incompetent simply because my father is who he is or because I was born as the son of Donald Trump? At the end of the day, you don’t get to pick your family; the only thing you really get to pick in your life is what you do with it.”

President Trump’s heir also said, “On the other hand, I don’t see other children of wealthy families being asked this question, do you? Therefore, the very fact that I’m being indirectly accused of serving as the head of my father’s business simply because I’m his son is rude in my book. And even if that were true – if I was only his son and nothing else – I could very easily run everything he’s worked so hard for into the ground. But, that’s the thing – that would hurt him and nobody else in this country. As a matter of fact, I think it’s about time we stopped insulting my father and started applauding him for the magnificent work he’s been doing since he became president.”

“You want to talk nepotism? How’s this: if I were the average American, which I still think is an awesome thing to be, I would not only support Donald Trump’s work as the president of the country, but I would also encourage him to hire as many of his family members as the leading team of all his companies and enterprises for one very simple reason,” the president’s eldest son revealed. “Donald Trump is a self-made billionaire who managed to become the president of the greatest country in the world, and did it all thanks to his hard work. As an American, that’s the kind of gene pool I’d want running the country 24/7 if you ask me.”

“I think forgiving and, what’s more, encouraging nepotism in the White House as well as the Trump family is the perfect way Americans can repay my father for the awesome pro-bono work he’s been doing as president so-far. Because, let’s not forget: we’re talking about a billionaire here. Being the President of the United States is all fine and dandy, but waking up in the morning and going for a dip in your very own pool of cash is even better. So, pro-bono work is something my dad has gone to great lengths to achieve and he doesn’t mind doing it. Plus, he’s paid a higher tax rate than former president Obama. Combined with the volunteering he’s doing at the White House, I think that’s as charitable as it gets,” Trump’s son concluded."

In the Sunday morning tweet storm, Trump attacked the Democratic National Committee, slammed the media and revealed plans to set up a “cyber security unit” with Putin. The Fox News host argued that Trump had to go after the media for incorrectly reporting that 17 intelligence agencies agreed that Russia meddled in the U.S. election. The New York Times has criticized Trump for this claim, noting that it was “misleading and suggests widespread dissent among American intelligence agencies when none has emerged.”

“It was about time the world saw what can be achieved when two of the greatest world powers join forces in order to shut up those who would have them destroy each other,” President Trump said in an interview with portal KnowMyRepublican.com. “We’ve been feuding and arguing for too long. Both the United States of America and the Russian Federation have a long history of power, and it would be foolish of both President Putin and myself to continue ignoring the vast potential that lies ahead if we just manage to put our differences aside and work together for a change. That has been something that was considered impossible for more than 70 years. The possibility of working closely with the Russians has been ignored by a number of my predecessors, including Barack Obama. But, I didn’t get to where I am today by following other peoples’ lead.”

President Trump also argued that America and Russia “alone have the power to end many of the world’s problems.” “I’m talking terrorism, this whole ISIS business, world hunger, the fossil fuel thing, wars, anything that comes to mind, our two countries have the power and resources to end it,” he said. “And that’s why I’ve talked very extensively and thoroughly with President Putin about setting up a cyber security unit that will have the job of protecting the world from hackers and any countries that would like to see the two of us go back to our old ways. He has agreed and I think this is a monumentally important historical precedent. For the first time in several decades, we will be able to again control the world like in the good, old days of the Cold War, when no other country posed a serious threat to us.”

“Basically, the way to move forward is, in this case, to go back to the way things were. Because, it’s just like with political parties – too many of them break up the cake into too many very small pieces. It’s good to have just one – in Russia’s case, communism – or very few – in our case, three – parties that divide the power equally between them. Similarly, when you have just two countries in the world that control everything, peace and prosperity are guaranteed. And that is the way to make America great again; to take back the power that was hoarded like bread crumbs by a number of smaller, insignificant countries in recent years. Everybody thinks they can have nukes today. Well, sorry to say it, but us and the Russians practically invented nukes, and we still have the biggest ones around. Now is not the time to be messing with either of us,” he concluded."

Kushner and Trump were reportedly on their way to a Flywheel class, an upscale indoor cycling club that offer classes for the populist-friendly price of $28 a class. The report, which was featured in Politico’s “Playbook” and picked up by the website Death and Taxes, seems to contradict previous accounts of Trump and Kushner’s commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement. The president’s eldest daughter reportedly pressured Trump to keep the United States’ commitment to the accord prior to his decision to withdraw.

After causing understandable hype in the media, Kushner was asked to comment on the report. He told portal KnowMyRepublican.com, “I really found it funny, I’m not kidding.” He added, “As a matter of fact, I find it hilarious that everybody keeps crying about how the United States of America is the number one invader and creator of conflicts in the world, and yet, at the same time, they’re also running to us every single time there’s a problem they can’t handle. You know, regardless of the fact that I’m close to the man who now happens to serve as President of the United States, I can’t help but feel like this country is nothing more than one gigantic charity organization in the eyes of the world. That is, when we’re not being accused of, how do they put it, ‘installing foreign governments’ and whatnot.”

Kushner also said, “Well, you know what? I’m fed up with catering to what the world wants America to do and ignoring what Americans want America to do. It’s about time we turned away from abiding by so-called international accords that only damage the reputation and wellbeing of our great nation. And when I say great, I mean the greatest. We are literally the richest and most powerful country in the world and we didn’t get there thanks to someone else. It’s our fathers and grandfathers that deserve our gratitude for leaving us this glorious bastion of freedom and wealth. And I don’t think they’d take kindly to us throwing away everything they worked so hard for.”

“To make it perfectly clear – why on Earth should we care about what happens to Paris? It’s a city half way around the world; to make matters worse, it’s in France. We never liked the French and they never liked us back and that’s not going to change any time soon. We’re in the USA and we need to focus on dealing with problems that we have here, not some climate issues, if such exist in the first place, that are plaguing a city in a country we liberated in World War 2, but have hated ever since. Any climate change that happens in and around Paris is France’s problem and our country should have no part in the Paris Climate Agreement. That is the official position of the United States Government, by the way,” he concluded."

But now that the laws have been made public, a closer look revealed that the pope has made it illegal to report sex crimes against children.

According to the new laws, revealing or receiving confidential Vatican information is now punishable by up to two years in prison, while newly defined sex crimes against children carry a sentence of up to twelve years. Because all sex crimes are kept confidential, there is no longer a legal way for Vatican officials to report sex crimes.

“We didn’t mean for this to happen, obviously,” lamented Vatican foreign minister Monsignor Dominique Mamberti. “It’s quite the papal pickle that His Holiness has placed upon our heads. Sex crimes are more illegal than ever, but technically it’s illegal to report them.” Mamberti said that the simultaneous passing of each law is merely a coincidence and insisted that the Church is not trying to protect itself against further embarrassment, but critics outside the Vatican are skeptical.

“They know exactly what they’re doing,” claims Fabrizio Perona of Italy’s La Repubblica newspaper. “They just thought nobody would notice. The Church wants to impress the world by getting tough on sex crimes, but they criminalized leaks, which is the only way anybody would ever discover their crimes. It’s genius, if you stop and think about it.”

Mamberti says plans are already being made to eliminate the loophole, but change often comes slowly to antiquated Vatican law, which is based on the 1889 Italian code. “We’re not going to let a dangerous law like this stand, but people need to understand that this is the Vatican, and there is a process here. Voting, incense, prayer. We ask the minors at risk to please be patient with us.”

Fortunately, only clergy and lay people who live and work in Vatican City are subject to the new legislation, which differs from the canon law governing the universal Catholic Church.

As the Holy See moves to clarify the law, Mamberti has warned would-be offenders within Vatican walls that they “are still subject to the most watchful eye of all: the eye of God. His judgment is greater than—oh, who am I kidding? For now, there is nothing we can do.”"

The Christian owners of Ashers Baking Company were convicted last week after refusing an order from gay rights activist Gareth Lee. He asked for a cake featuring Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie and the words “Support Gay Marriage.”

“Belfast judge Isobel Brownlie ruled that the bakery had discriminated against Lee on grounds of sexual orientation and political beliefs and ordered it to pay 500 pounds ($765) in damages. Members of the McArthur family, the bakery’s owners, said Thursday they would appeal. They said: “We have done nothing wrong as we have discriminated against no individual but rather acted according to what the Bible teaches regarding marriage.”

Speaking exclusively for Newslo on why they made the decision to refuse Mr. Lee’s order when they knew there would likely be legal consequences, the spokesperson for the family said: “It is one thing to be able to compromise on things you’re not okay with, but it’s completely another to go head on against your beliefs.”

The spokesperson added: “You know, the head of the family [who owns the company] told me that he was the one who made the decision and the rest of the members went along with it. He said that he would not be able to live with himself had he accepted the order. The thought of it made him think of sin and he would see it every time he closed his eyes. The man couldn’t sleep at night, so you see, there really was no other way to go about this than to say no.”

“’What kind of an example would I set for other Christians?’ he asked me. I didn’t know what to answer him,” the spokesperson concluded."

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, tore into the US remarks published on his official website and on his Twitter account.

“Khamenei made clear he was neither rejecting nor endorsing the framework deal announced last week. But he challenged the way the US was describing it – specifically, a fact sheet put out by the White House saying sanctions would be removed only after inspectors verify Iran’s compliance.

“The Ayatollah, in one tweet, claimed the fact sheet was “contrary to what was agreed.” In another, he said: “I trust our negotiators, but I’m really worried as the other side is into lying & breaching promises; an example was White House fact sheet.”

“Ever since the preliminary deal was unveiled, Iranian officials have claimed – in their own remarks and fact sheets – that the agreement allows for sanctions to be lifted immediately once a final deal is reached. On Thursday, both the Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and the Ayatollah again insisted that all sanctions be removed as soon as a deal is reached, or implemented.

““We will not sign any agreement, unless all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the first day of the implementation of the deal,” Rouhani said during a ceremony marking Iran’s nuclear technology day, which celebrates the country’s nuclear achievements. During the ceremony, President Rouhani spoke to Newslo exclusively and said that he “has seen some idiotic nations in his day,” but that the Americans are “in the lead big time.”

“I know that politics is a thing of subtlety and I’m also aware that citizens don’t really want to bother with who said what and how someone will respond to what someone else said, but the fact to the matter is the citizens are the ones who vote in the elections and they’re the ones who choose presidents and politicians in power. But how the Americans managed to choose their current leaders is beyond me,” President Rouhani said.

He added: “You would have to be mindless idiots to believe what the American leaders are saying about world politics. Americans are being steered into a war and exploited like cattle and they’re not even aware of it. They may have the money and the technology, but they’re living like slaves. American leaders are lying to their own people and that’s a sad thing to see.”"

But with Iranian-backed rebels now overrunning the US ally tasked with beating back local al-Qaeda affiliates, the nation at the tip of the Arabian Peninsula makes a better case study in the approach’s limitations.

“Yemen was the petri dish for Obama’s concept of how to fight Islamic extremists with a hybrid warfare of US drone strikes, special forces and on-the-ground intelligence provided by local partners. The theory was that, after learning the bloody lessons of protracted ground wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States could no longer bear the cost of inserting its large, vulnerable land armies into hostile Muslim nations.

“Instead, Washington would eliminate terrorists by partnering with friendly governments and forces in regions as diverse as the Persian Gulf, the Levant and Africa in a more sustainable campaign against Islamic extremism. But the success of some of these campaigns is in question, as regional allies have proven too week or disorganized to sustain the anti-terror actions the US is looking for.

“For a while, the partnership with Yemen worked. The local government in concert with the CIA and Special Forces assets on the ground, and a deadly umbrella of drone strikes, pinned down the deadliest franchise left in Osama bin Laden’s empire, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).

“But, Yemen’s instability always threatened to derail the effort and the country’s treacherous tribal and political stew finally boiled over in January when Houthi rebels overthrew President Abd Mansour Hadi, Washington’s latest partner in the capital of Sanaa.

“Obama’s critics argue that the events in Yemen undercut his hands-off approach and leave his anti-terror strategy full of holes. They blame him for abdicating a US leadership role in the Middle East that has spanned multiple presidencies. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who is mulling a run for president, said: “The region is on fire. Leading from behind is not working.”

However, president Obama, in true American spirit, has not given up. In fact, he exclusively revealed to Newslo a part of his plan to both regain US control in Yemen and gain an advantage over Iran in the nuclear talks.

“I’m not really sure how I didn’t come up with this sooner,” he said. “It’s the perfect plan that guarantees the US will once again demonstrate its superior intellect and sense of strategy in the face of its opponent.”

“If the uranium is stored in Yemen, who is practically Iran’s right hand at the moment, we will have forged a long-term solution that will guarantee peace in the region for years to come, not to mention the fact that there will almost be no consequences of radiation; the place is a desert, who will it hurt? It’s like killing two birds with one stone,” the president concluded."

“I didn’t expect that,” said audience member Jon Baker. “Being here I figured we’d be treated to some wacky, Maury Povich-type stuff. But a real-life, up-close hanging? That’s straight out of a Tarantino flick.”

Cobb at first denied the DNA test results linking him to a Sub-Saharan ancestry, referring to the findings as statistical noise. “Wait a minute, wait a minute, hold on, just wait a minute,” said a frantic Cobb. “Do I look black to you?”

But as host Trisha Goddard moved to fist-bump Cobb while exclaiming “Bro!” Cobb reportedly said that he “could feel the blackness suddenly and uncontrollably creeping up inside of [him],” precipitating a fist-bump reciprocation.

“At that moment he realized it was true,” said Baker. “He was undeniably black. But instead of embracing his heritage, he ran from it. I guess it’s all he knew how to do.”

By this point, NBC had already cut to commercial, providing Baker and fellow audience members with an exclusive, front-row seat to the spectacle that was about to ensue—one that no one attempted to stop.

“He’s a white supremacist, which is pretty much the lowest form of humanity,” continued Baker.

“So we kind of just sat there and let him do his thing. First he created a noose from his shirt and then he stepped on to the chair. Then, well – I don’t think I need to explain the rest.”

Not even members of the white enclave that Cobb helped form in Leith, N.D. felt sympathy for their deceased white supremacist leader."

He claimed that the belief systems are two of the main ills facing our society, that they lead to sexual perversion, sexual abuse, and the complete loss of hope, and that people following these two views should be rounded up and placed in special ‘camps’ to keep them separated from the rest of America.

“If there is no God, then we are ruled by our instincts,” he said. “Of course, this leads us, when there are no moral absolutes, leads us to sexual immorality, leads us to sexual abuse, leads us to perversion and, of course, no hope. No hope!”

In the past, Cruz, an evangelical preacher and avowed creationist, has claimed that God endorses the Death Penalty, that evolution is a communist trick aimed at converting people to atheism, that legalizing gay marriage will lead to preachers being arrested for hate speech just for reading the Bible, and that President Obama is a tyrant who needs to go back to Kenya. This is, however, the first time he’s laid out his plan on how to save mankind from secular humanism.

See Also: Ted Cruz: “I Gave Up My Canadian Citizenship; Unlike Obama, I’m Christian On Both Sides”

He warned that atheists are in danger of corrupting the youth of America and called for action before America was overrun. His solution to what he termed ‘the problem of the Godless’ is the creation of a series of ‘Heathen Zones’- fenced-in camps located mostly in Northern California and Vermont.

“It’s a free country,” he said. “If these people need to practice their holy rites of atheism, they can do so, as long as they are in clearly-marked encampments far away from the rest of us.”

“While they’re in their Heathen Zones, they’re free to dance naked around the fire, brand the mark of the Devil on their flesh or whatever else they want to do,” he added. “Of course, if they step one foot outside the electrified fence we shoot them between the eyes. Two or three times, just to be sure.”

He also argued that any children spawned in these camps would be removed at birth so they would not be drawn into secular humanism via their birth-mother’s tainted breast milk."

According to the website, attorney Charles J. Harder is asking that the video, posted by James Hunter, be taken down and that Hunter issue an apology. In a letter from the attorney obtained by TMZ, Harder said that the video implies the 10-year-old is autistic, which the family insists is false.

In an exclusive interview with E! Online, the wife of President-elect Donald Trump also argued that she is considering a lawsuit against “any and all persons who like, share, react to, Tweet, post or further encourage the false claims of Barron’s autism on social media or otherwise.” “I will not tolerate anyone attacking my family, let alone a 10-year-old boy who has wronged no one and has nothing to do with other people’s desire to become famous and popular,” she added. “That’s why this has to stop immediately, and I don’t care how many lawsuits it’s going to take for that to happen.”

“I realized when I first married my husband that I am going to be subjected to far more scrutiny and public interest compared to the attention I was getting when I was a model,” the future First Lady said. “And I came to terms with that because it comes with the territory, you can’t have one without the other. Somewhere in the back of my mind I knew that this sort of thing was likely to happen and I’ve been kind of trying to prepare for it, but to be quite honest – I don’t think anything can really prepare you for someone attacking your child and calling them sick. That’s crossing the line and has to have consequences, legal or otherwise.”

She continued, “Therefore, as of today, I am asking people to stop encouraging the video in question because they too will face a lawsuit because of it. I don’t want to hurt anyone or cause them discomfort, but at the end of the day, I have to react just like every mother should when her child’s safety and wellbeing is brought into question. And in case you’re thinking, ‘You’ll never be able to find all of us because the Internet is a huge place,’ let me just say that my husband is a self-made billionaire who just became the president of this country. How hard do you think it’ll be for him to compile a list for me of everybody that shared the video when I do my thing to him?”

“Oh, and I almost forgot,” Melania added. “In addition to the people who support the false video regarding my son, I am also going to sue anybody who has the audacity to claim that I used to be a porn star. I’ve seen this rumor floating around the Internet some time ago, and I don’t like it one bit. This is an invasion of my privacy and I plan to take full legal action to prevent that from happening again. And besides – even if I were, that would be my problem, not everyone else’s,” she concluded."

The wall, which several previously high-trafficked areas of the U.S.-Mexico border already have – whether an actual wall or a several tiered fencing and integrated technological system – has been a controversial issue to pundits and politicians who lack information on the subject.

However, in a surprising turn of events, several representatives of Mexican drug cartels have come forward recently and, after requesting anonymity for understandable reasons, stated that there will be “no need” to seize their funds in order to pay for the Trump Wall, because, as they claimed, “we are more than willing to give the money to Mr. Trump with which to fund construction if that will guarantee his presidency in November’s presidential election.”

“There is no need for any type of confrontation or escalation of violence, especially now that tensions are so high between law enforcement and civilians, American, Mexican, or otherwise,” one of the representatives said in an interview with a Southern Texas local radio station. “There is no need to go through great lengths to come up with the money as our organizations would be more than happy to help Mr. Trump build his wall should he become president.”

Asked to elaborate on the reason behind their surprising and hard-to-believe statements, one of the cartel spokespersons added that his organization is “relying on the good word of future president Donald Trump about the U.S. stopping its meddling in other countries’ business.” “We believe him to be a man of his word, otherwise, how else would he have gotten to the position of a presidential candidate? He must be a very honest and straightforward man if he’s doing the job that he is,” they said.

“Mexico is struggling enough without having the United States interfering in its internal problems constantly, so we’re hoping this gesture of good faith will prompt Mr. Trump to keep his promise and stop America from running Mexico’s government and politicians like puppets on a string,” the spokesman said. When asked what else the cartels stand to gain from such a deal, things got quite interesting.

“Obviously, leaving Mexico alone is one thing, and it’s very important to us,” he said. “The other thing is that we don’t expect to suffer any major losses when it comes to large shipments of our main product into U.S. territory, because smuggling packages via mules through underground beneath-the-border tunnels is a thing of the past. Nowadays we’re doing it with style. That’s why I’d like to sent a message to Mr. Trump, and that message is that he should feel free to build the wall as high as he wants; our private jets can fly pretty high, too.”

“So, he should really go all out with this one, because, who knows if he’ll ever get another chance like this to build something so monumental using someone else’s money. Although, now that I’ve mentioned it, he IS going to be President of the United States, so I guess he’ll be wasting Americans’ money on all kinds of business endeavors. Well, you can’t win ‘em all,” the spokesperson said with a grin."

He’s unsurprisingly not alone in that thinking. Golden State coach Steve Kerr has called Donald Trump’s policies un-American. Stephen Curry essentially called the American president an a*s. David West said Trump’s approach is the opposite of what the forward teaches youth. But this level of unified decision-making was still somewhat surprising to see after the Warriors clinched the 2017 NBA title. This isn’t the first time players faced that conflict – participating in a photo op with someone whose policies and rhetoric you find reprehensible vs. respecting the office of the presidency – though, they have usually sided with respecting the office and getting the experience of a lifetime.

Meanwhile, counselor to U.S. President, Kellyanne Conway is at it again. In an interview with Minnesota’s KYSP Radio, she argued that the news of the Warriors’ refusal to visit the White House in a celebratory fashion is “a disrespectful act” and something you just don’t turn down. “First of all, I have to mention that I was going to congratulate the team for their win, but then I realized I’d be acting against my position by doing so. That’s the first thing. The second thing, I mean, I understand that everyone has the right to free will and all that, but everybody knows that an invite to visit the White House is a privilege not many are granted. It’s just one of those things you don’t turn down. So, to do something like this, and publicly, it’s a scandal,” she said.

She continued, “One could almost say it’s a rule. As a matter of fact, you know something? I’m just going to go out there and say it: it’s a law. And though I know it’s not really a law, I’m going to make sure to make it one. Because, it’s not about who the president is; the guy’s in there only temporarily. It’s about the structure, the space, the history within it and, ultimately, the honor of being inside a place where so many decisions took place; decisions that shaped the world as we know it. Ugh, I’m getting goosebumps just thinking about it. I can’t even begin to describe how I felt when I visited it for the first time. The Warriors don’t realize it yet, but they’re looking at this all wrong.”

“That’s exactly why I plan to do everything in my power to make sure Golden State is prohibited from winning the championship, formally speaking, unless they agree to come and celebrate in the White House. That’s the rule – or the law, whichever one you prefer – because I refuse to let this privilege be smeared by a group of so-called athletes who are such prima donnas that they can’t fathom being a part of something greater than their own puny achievements. Winning the NBA is done by a different team every year; but, there’s only one White House. That’s the gameplay, fellas. I hope I made it clear enough for you,” she concluded."

The NBA have until next season to dump Sterling for the racist remarks he made, or lose one of the best basketball players since Michael Jordan."

“ISIS’s inevitable takeover of the NFL is a horrific vision. Burqas provide no head or body protection whatsoever. And by dressing all teams identically, ISIS will make it extremely difficult for NFL players to distinguish between their team members and opponents. How we will determine the true winner of this year’s Superbowl!” Mr. Poe added.

While ISIS has not specifically threatened to dress NFL players in Islamic garb during their violent messages to America, Mr. Poe sees redecorating the NFL as “ISIS’s most obvious next move.”

Prior to his address about ISIS’s NFL burqa Armageddon, Poe alerted the American people that ISIS could infiltrate the United States across the southern border. Poe predicts ISIS will call upon Mexican drug cartels to traffic terrorists into America, thus advising President Obama to strengthen security at the U.S.-Mexico border, not only as means to prevent illegal aliens from entering, but as a weapon for thwarting ISIS’s next act of terror against the NFL.

Poe’s premonition that ISIS will seep into America has been further validated by Gary Painter, sheriff of Midland County, Texas, who reported finding Qurans, Islamic clothing, and sketches of Dallas Cowboys players wearing full-length burqas scattered along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Senator Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has seconded these concerns, stating that President Obama “needs to rise to the occasion before we all get killed back here at home, before ISIS covertly enters NFL locker rooms across America and sends our athletes out onto the field dressed in burqas, which aren’t even supposed to be worn by men in the first place.”"

He’s Just A Man”,['Lea Vat Kens'],"Fox News host Sean Hannity prepared his audience for yet another woman coming forward with accusations of sexual assault against Donald Trump, insisting the newest charge against the Republican presidential candidate is “going nowhere.” “I told you there was going to be some bomb this week,” Hannity said Wednesday on the Sean Hannity Show. “There’s this woman that had claimed that Donald Trump raped her when she was thirteen years old and is going to break her silence on Wednesday afternoon,” Hannity said. “So that’s the one they’ve been holding back on.”

“And here’s the key thing I personally have a problem with here,” he added. “Imagine you’re a Democrat, right. You’re a liberal and your sole objective from the moment you wake up in the morning till the moment you go back to bed at night is figuring out how to take down Donald Trump. And trust me, there are people like that all over the place, it’s incredible. Anyway, that’s all you think about, 24/7. And after you’ve tried every possible trick in the book – and have taken advantage of Trump’s own incidents against him – you realize he’s just too tough of a nut to crack, right. So, what do you do next?”

He continued, “Well, you start thinking outside the box. And since you’ve already exhausted every child molester, serial rapist, misogynist, bigoted and every other angle you could think of, you’re down to one option. You come up with this idea to pay some random 13-year-old girl a handsome amount of money to accuse Donald Trump of raping her. Now, we’re talking here about a guy who’s had so many girls and women in his life he doesn’t remember 99% of them. And naturally, when a cute, little 13-year-old girl asks him if he remembers raping her, he’s going to go with ‘I don’t think so, but I’m not sure.’”

“So, your plan is working like a charm up until this point,” Hannity said. “Now it’s time to get everybody on Trump’s case and take him down once and for all. But, here’s why that won’t work either – you paid an underage girl to lie and accuse an innocent man of rape, and then you want to convince the public that he should be blamed for it? Basically, your goal is to blame a billionaire for raping a 13-year-old girl he never even met? This is Donald Trump we’re talking about here – he could have small girls by the bucket loads waiting for him anytime, anywhere, including importing foreign ones from abroad. They’re much easier to work with because, after all, they don’t fight back as hard as our girls.”

“But, anyway – great plan, genius, it’s really fail-proof. And you know what the best part of it is? You’re putting all your money on the public condemning a man for falling for the spell of a woman, or in this case, young girl. How would you expect him to react? ‘Hey, here’s a young girl who’s DTF, but I think I’ll sit this one out?’ Yeah – said no man ever. No normal male would ever turn down free sex, and yes, dear ladies – that also goes for those snot-nosed, geek types of men you have doing your choirs at home. If it’s a tight hole and it’s attached to two legs, preferably belonging to a female homo sapiens, us guys are good to go. And trust me, Donald Trump is no different in that regard,” Hannity concluded."

Rushmore “As One Of The Founding Fathers”,['Lea Vat Kens'],"“There are many ways to describe South Dakota’s way of attracting millennials, and one of them is to refer to it as “out of this world.” Namely, in an attempt to re-brand the state, South Dakota’s government – with the help of a marketing firm – has launched a new ad campaign with a simple, albeit bizarre message: “Moving here is better than moving to Mars.”

““Mars. The air not breathable. The surface: cold and barren,” the commercial begins. “But thousands are lining up for a chance to go there and never come back. But wait just a minute, would-be Mars rovers. Have you considered South Dakota?” The narrator makes the pitch: “South Dakota. Progressive. Productive. And abundant in oxygen. Why die on Mars when you can live in South Dakota?”

“While the ad is raising eyebrows, the Argus Leader detailed the painstaking process that went into this approach. The goal of the Governor’s office of Economic Development was to attract young people to a place deemed “boring.” Commissioner Pat Costello said the “hook works” with the younger generation, whom they are trying to attract.

“Costello told the newspaper: “You can live a life here. You can have fun here. You can have a great job and go fishing and biking and hiking. The opportunities are abundant.” And then he whipped out the ad-reference: “And hey – it really is way better than Mars.”

However, it would seem that politicians aren’t just focused on the 2016 presidential elections. One of the most conservative Republicans out there at the moment, Scott Walker, Gov. of Wisconsin, apparently caught sight of the peculiar advertisement and expressed his support and personal view on the matter in an exclusive interview with Newslo.

“I am well aware that people think I’m utterly conservative. But you know what? I don’t have a problem with that, not at all,” Walker stated. “In fact, one of the most conservative, and at the same time, impressive architectural features in the world is in South Dakota and the state’s government does it justice by trying to attract more people. Mt. Rushmore is a feature unlike any other I know about, and it’s synonymous with the state of South Dakota.”

He continued: “However, I do feel that Mt. Rushmore can be improved and left to the coming generations in a more glorious state than it was left for us by our predecessors. In addition to the founding fathers of this great nation, I think that carving the face of Jesus Christ into the rock would only amplify the significance of that great monument for all true Americans, since Jesus himself was also a founding father. I truly believe that it would help sway the misguided youth of this country onto their right and honorable path.”

Walker concluded by adding: “Not to mention it would do wonders for South Dakota’s tourism revenues.”"

“Fiorina told reporters at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast: “I think that if Hillary Clinton were to face a female nominee, there are a whole set of things that she won’t be able to talk about. She won’t be able to talk about being the first woman president. She won’t be able to talk about a war on women without being challenged. She won’t be able to play the gender card.”

“Fiorina said in a female vs. female presidential match-up, Clinton would have to run on “her track record, her accomplishments, her candor and trustworthiness and her policies.” She continued: “And I think that’s what elections should be run on – not identity politics, not what you look like, but who you are, and what you believe, and what you’ve done, and what you will do.”

“The former Hewlett-Packard CEO is publicly undecided on whether to run for president, but she’s been making preparations for a campaign, traveling to early primary states to gauge interest in a potential bid. This week she’ll be in New Hampshire with the rest of the potential and announced GOP presidential contenders for the Republican leadership summit, hosted by the New Hampshire Republican Party.

“She’s been an outspoken critic of Clinton since the Democrat launched her campaign this last weekend, charging Tuesday that Clinton “lacks accomplishment” and knocking her on equal pay for women on Facebook. But Fiorina argued Thursday that aside from her gender, her business experience made her uniquely qualified for the presidency. “I’m not a neophyte in government, but I’m not a professional politician,” she said. She later added: “I understand how the world works.”

In an exclusive interview with Newslo, Fiorina stated that “Clinton is known to be well-prepared for every public appearance in her schedule,” but that “she’d have a hard time preparing for a debate with another female.”

“Everybody loves a girl-on-girl fight, that’s no secret,” Fiorina pointed out. “I can’t tell you which of the two of us would win, but I can say she’d definitely have her hands full with me. My unique business experience puts me in a position to view things from another, more professional angle, and that’s something she’ll never have. She just hasn’t done enough for this country to be worthy of presidency.”

And then, the gloves finally came off: “Who am I kidding? I would totally obliterate her in a debate. There is just too much at stake.”"

The new requests are being made by Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, following revelations that both women used a private internet service and email accounts for State Department correspondence.

“Grassley says that the earlier requests to the department have been largely ignored, so the new ones have gone to the department’s inspector general and to Secretary of State John Kerry, seeking their involvement. Grassley’s probe started in 2013, when he requested all communications between Abedin, after she switched from a full-time deputy chief of staff for Clinton to a part-timer, then started working for Teneo, a consulting firm that says it “brings together the disciplines of government and public affairs.”

“A July 2013 letter from the department to Grassley, provided by the senator’s office, states Abedin worked full-time from January 2009 to June 2012. It also states Abedin did not list outside employment upon ending her full-time employment and that the department retained her as an adviser-expert at the hourly rate of a SGA GS-15/10. The most recent available federal documents show the rate as $74.51 with a maximum pay of $155,500 annually.

“The letter to department Inspector General Steve Linick also questions whether the department’s “excessive” use of SGE designations undermines ethics standards and if Abedin and Clinton’s private emails have the potential to impede the department from fulfilling Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, requests, over which the upper chamber’s Judiciary Committee has legislative jurisdiction.

Oddly enough, when asked by Newslo to comment on her assistant and their emails, Clinton, who is known for having a sharp tongue in almost every occasion, refused to do so. The former Secretary of State kept quiet even when Newslo’s reporter continued to insist with the question. However, she did finally comment, and rather angrily, on the question of whether her silence was to be taken as a sign of something more between the former First Lady and her mysterious assistant.

Clinton said: “How dare you ask me such a question? I most certainly did not have sexual relations with that woman. Mine and Huma Abedin’s relationship is strictly professional and I don’t know where you get such ideas. Oh, wait a minute…have you been talking to my husband? Never mind,” she concluded and left in a hurry."

The White House, clearly angered by an address criticizing its Iran deal-making, denied Netanyahu an Oval Office meeting during the visit. The reason, according to an official statement, was to “avoid the appearance of influencing a democratic election in a foreign country.”

“Snubbing an Israeli prime minister, though, can influence Israeli voters as much as giving him a West Wing photo-op. And with US-Israel tensions at a peak, many in Washington see telltale signs of an effort to oust a leader standing in the way of Obama administration’s Middle East policies.

“A senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, David Weinberg, who has studied American influence in Israeli elections, said: “This election cycle in Israel fits the hallmark of an American administration that seeks to influence the outcome.” The White House denied it was attempting to influence the Israeli elections by rebuffing Netanyahu and pointed to the well-circulated statement on why the prime minister wasn’t offered a meeting: “As a matter of principle and long-standing practice, we do not see heads of state or candidates in close proximity to their elections.”

“But such visits – or the lack thereof – have historically been one of the diplomatic weapons US administrations have deployed to sway the Israeli public. Previous presidents have bristled at the hawkish, unflinching posture – especially when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process – that Netanyahu and other Likud party leaders have often struck. But the current antagonism, exacerbated by the speech, has become particularly personal.

“On the other hand, when Republican House Speaker John Boehner extended the invitation to Netanyahu, many jumped on the House leader for helping the prime minister politically. This week, footage of Netanyahu being warmly received on Capitol Hill made it into a campaign ad. The bipartisan nature of the invitation and the fact that it was done without White House coordination – Boehner is a chief Obama rival and disagrees emphatically with his Iran policy – heightened Democratic pique over Netanyahu’s appearance.

However, when Newslo spoke to “Reuven Y. Hazan, the chairman of the political science department at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, on the topic of the Israeli election, he stated that: “the question is not whether Netanyahu will win or lose the election; it’s whether the Democrats or Republicans will.”

““Netanyahu’s speech in Washington was not to save Israel but to save himself; he should have stayed at home and addressed the concerns that trouble most Israelis,” Hazan told Newslo. “The Israeli are a very clever people; we had to be in order to survive in this world. And no one is blind. Even though it’s not being said out loud, everyone’s aware that Netanyahu is just a pawn in the political crusade between the GOP and Democrats. That’s precisely why his tunnel-vision view on things isn’t helping anyone. So, instead of focusing on Netanyahu, the world should be observing the Israeli election as a vote for either the GOP or Obama.”"

As far as the people that were injured, it’s an absolute shame. You just want them to recover. Fortunately, the guy was a really bad shot…liberals can’t even shoot straight.” On Wednesday, gunman James Hodgkinson opened fire on a group of Republican congressmen and their aides who were practicing for a charity baseball match against Democrats. Five people were injured and Hodgkinson was killed by police. He was a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and was feverishly devoted to liberal and progressive causes.

“Now, my life story is, admittedly, not one you encounter every day,” Jenner continued. “I’ve had quite an eventful existence, riddled with both ups and downs and I am grateful to be in this position right now. However, the thing I’m even more grateful for is the fact that I’m a Republican and that I’m supporting the right group of people in this country. Republicans are the best thing to happen to America in the last 50 years by far. On the other hand, we also have the liberals, Democrats or whatever you want to call them. Here’s the thing – everybody who’s blessed enough to be born in this country enjoys the most beautiful thing a human being can enjoy in their life and that’s freedom. That freedom has to do with everything, but most importantly, it has to do with choice. The freedom of choice is what really makes this country great.”

Jenner also said, “But, the thing that bothers me about the liberals is, they purport to want to give the citizens of this country a right to choose, yet they can’t make the right choice themselves. The first wrong choice a liberal makes in their life is, well, to become a liberal. The second wrong choice they make is the choice to lie to the American people. Take their supposed support to gay and transgender people, for example. They make that a staple of their campaign, their creed, and then one of their supporters goes out and tries to kill Republicans during a baseball practice. To make matters worse, he can’t even shoot straight, like I said. As a matter of fact, no liberal can shoot straight. And you know what that means: if they can’t shoot straight, well, the only option they’re left with is to shoot gays.”

“In reality, what this recent tragedy has shown us is the very thing the liberals have been trying to keep secret since the day they were founded. They do not support the freedom of choice, they do not support multiculturalism, they do not support anything that has to do with any sort of liberty – they’re basically communists in disguise. And above all, they hate gays and transgender people – I should know, we’re born with a radar for people like that. That’s why I feel sorry for every single LGBTQ person in this country that voted for Hillary Clinton in the last presidential election, as well as in any type of election ever. You’ve been lied to and you need to come around as soon as possible, because we’re going to be the targeted in the incidents to come. And trust me – there will be more and more shootings because liberals have started losing their grip of reality and it’s beginning to show,” she concluded."

Giving employers such power is now prohibited by legislation including the 2008 genetic privacy and nondiscrimination law known as GINA. The new bill gets around that landmark law by stating explicitly that GINA and other protections do not apply when genetic tests are part of a “workplace wellness” program. The bill, HR 1313, was approved by a House committee on Wednesday, with all 22 Republicans supporting it and all 17 Democrats opposed.

However, the reason for the bill has less to do with the suspected discrimination of employees based on their genetics, which is to say, ethnicity, and more to do with, apparently, religion. Namely, a source within the committee who requested anonymity, told the Cincinnati Morning Star that the reason why the employer lobby pushed the Republicans into passing the bill was because they were “worried about the religious aspects of their employees’ personal lives, but could not ask them directly, as that would be considered offensive and discriminatory.” Apparently, companies are shifting their focus towards hiring only staff that have a strong connection to their religious side and are God-fearing.

“The moment you have a liberal employee that also happens to be an atheist or something or other, that’s when you know they don’t take their job as seriously as their traditionally-inclined coworkers, which also tends to ruin the work ethic in the office,” the source revealed. “It’s common knowledge that God-fearing workers have an innately different approach to their job; they’re more serious, more hardworking, more productive and, most importantly, are willing to work longer hours compared to their liberal colleagues. All these qualities simply make them the more desirable type of workers to have on the job, especially since everybody’s on about discrimination and equal rights and whatnot these days.”

“Moreover,” the source continued, “there’s also another aspect of God-fearing employees that makes them particularly attractive for companies and businesses. For example, liberal workers also tend to have a disruptive sexual preference and influence on the collective, which can cause a mutiny, let’s put it like that. If you have 9 workers who are God-fearing and traditional and extremely hardworking, and you also have a tenth one who’s an atheist and also happens to be homosexual, that’s something that can very easily bring about a whole lot of problems for you as an employer, and especially for the 9 workers who don’t want to work in that sort of environment.”

“That’s why it’s important for companies to have insight into the results of their employees’ genetic tests, so they can see right off the bat which of them are at the risk of becoming disruptive and disobedient. As an employer, you want a homogenous structure of workers to be handling challenges on a daily basis. If you have one or several of them who keep making waves and pissing off the rest of the guys and you realize you have to fire them for it, you’re at risk of being sued for discrimination, mobbing or whatever. This is just a simple way to avoid getting into a situation like that,” the source concluded."

He opined that “allowing each country in the world to have a nuclear weapon” is “right now the best way of ensuring such equality.”

Asked about why he feels that way, the real estate magnate mentioned the Umpqua Community College mass shooting in Oregon, which took place in early October, saying that “lives would have been saved if more people had guns at that college.” “I can make the case that if there were guns in that room other than [the shooter’s], fewer people would have died. Fewer people would have been so horribly injured.”

“And the same logic can be applied to the bigger picture. I mean, right now you’ve got a situation where there’s terrorism and where people are scared to walk the streets of their neighborhoods because they fear a suicide bomber might blow himself up right next to them. And we’ve got to ask ourselves, ‘Why is this happening?’ ‘What motivates these people to take their own lives in such a way?’ And it’s not about idealism or religion, I don’t believe that. It has to do with jealousy, and that comes from inequality,” Trump opined.

He continued: “Why do you think so many people want to become Americans? Because this is the greatest country in the world and because people are drawn to us like flies to honey. And some of them choose to take the easy way out and migrate, while others are forced to stay behind in third world countries. That causes discontent, those people aren’t happy. So, that’s where we need to look for answers. And I think nuclear weapons are the answer we’ve been looking for for a long time.”

Trump then brought forth a theory that “giving a nuclear warhead to every country in the world would make them feel more important and more significant on the world political stage, which would result in fewer actual confrontations and wars.” “I’m not talking about a new arms race; I’m talking about a more equal distribution of power,” he added. “A distribution of power that could end wars, not start them.”

He also said, “And I also believe that would be a great way to get rid of some of the more antiquated nuclear weaponry our country has been having trouble maintaining. This would easily solve that problem. Then, a person in the audience asked, “But, wouldn’t that weaken us as a country and increase our enemies’ destructive potential?”

Trump slightly smiled and replied, “You clearly weren’t listening. I said we should encourage a MORE equal distribution of power, not a COMPLETELY equal one. We’d still keep the best stuff for ourselves. Or, in the words of the great Henry Ford, ‘Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black.’ I think that explains everything.”"

We Never Cared About The Truth”",['Marry-Ann Michaelson'],"“NBC News recently celebrated Brian Williams’ 10 years as anchor of “NBC Nightly News” with a promotional campaign that stressed trust and experience. Now he is in a fight for his journalistic life.

“Williams’ false statements regarding his accounts of his trip on a military helicopter during the 2003 invasion of Iraq have triggered an internal investigation at NBC News into the anchor’s versions of his story. The tale has come under attack from Iraq war veterans and spurred a growing chorus from media critics who say his job may be on the line.

“A journalism professor at USC’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and a former broadcast news reporter, Judy Muller, said: “if you are a journalist, your basic job description is reporting the truth, so if you are caught telling a lie – intentional or not – your credibility is going to be seriously impaired. At the very least, in the age of instant judgment, you will be Twittered into a punch line.”

“Williams has said in recent years that he was in a Chinook helicopter that was forced down by a grenade and small-arms fire, even though his original 2003 reporting said it was another helicopter in the formation that was hit. Crew members in the 159th Aviation Regiment who were on the mission disputed Williams’ account to Stars and Stripes. Williams apologized earlier this week, and he told Stars and Stripes he did not know what caused him to “conflate one aircraft with another.”

“NBC News has assigned the head of its own investigative unit to look into the statements made by Williams. Richard Esposito, a former editor at the New York Daily News now at NBC, will head the investigation. The incident has ballooned into a full-blown crisis for NBC and Williams, whose “Nightly News” is the top-rated evening news program.

Williams exclusively told Newslo: “I have made several public apologies for my earlier statements, but I just don’t know what else people want me to do? If I had the power to turn back time, believe me, I would! I would go back and make sure I never say those words, but they’re out there and I can’t take them back.”

He added: “anyway, it’s not like I’ve done much damage. It’s the freakin’ NBC, we’ve never been about the truth. As long as the dollars kept rolling in, we would have been happy reporting even Jesus’ second coming.”"

In a private session with lawmakers, the king showed an extraordinary measure of anger – anger which he expressed by citing American movie icon Clint Eastwood.

“Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter Jr., a Marine Corps veteran of two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan, who was in the meeting with the king, said: “he said there is going to be retribution like ISIS hasn’t seen. He mentioned ‘Unforgiven’ and he mentioned Clint Eastwood, and he actually quoted a part of the movie.”

“Hunter would not say which part of “Unforgiven” the king quoted, but noted it was where Eastwood’s character describes how he is going to deliver his retribution. There is a scene in the picture in which Eastwood’s character, William Munny, says, “any man I see out there, I’m gonna kill him. Any son of a bitch takes a shot at me, I’m not only going to kill him, I’m going to kill his wife and all his friends and burn his damn house down.”

“Hunter said of King Abdullah: “he’s angry. They’re starting more sorties tomorrow than they’ve ever had. They’re starting tomorrow. And he said, ‘the only problem we’re going to have is running out of fuel and bullets.’”

““He’s ready to get it on,” Hunter added. “He really is. It reminded me of how we were after 9/11. We were ready to give it to them.”

Speaking exclusively for Newslo, King Abdullah said: “yes, of course I’m mad! Wouldn’t you be?! That’s why I decided to consult one of the toughest men I know and a guy I personally look up to. Clint’s experience in the Wild West is extensive and I’ve decided to offer him an exclusive contract to act as my consultant for the time being. Until this crisis is over, I think it’s best to have Clint by my side 24/7. No ISIS member would dare mess with him. Not if they feel lucky, the punks.”"

In an interview with portal KnowMyRepublican.com, Reed argued that, despite what Americans may think about Obamacare, “it is not a good enough healthcare system.” “I know the bigger picture keeps eluding folks because it takes quite a bit of brain power to process everything that’s going on here, but let me try to paint the picture for you just a bit,” he said. “The reason why everybody’s so upset that we’re trying to replace the Affordable Care Act is because they think that whatever we come up with instead is going to cost them a lot more money. The truth is, there’s two ways of looking at it: there’s what it looks like on the receiving end of the program, and then there’s the providing end. In short, people think Obamacare is good because they get free or cheap health insurance. But they don’t see how much it bleeds the budget on the other end.”

He continued, “Now, I certainly understand the need to be concerned about these things. After all, I’m a citizen of this country too and I am faced with the same problems as everybody else. But the simple fact is, if we don’t do this, if we don’t replace the Affordable Care Act with something cheaper, it is going to end up ruining the budget and we’ll be faced with another economic recession. But, that’s not all there is to it. You see, of course we care about the people of America. We’re not just going to leave them high and dry. Now, what I’m suggesting – and what everybody seems to have a hard time understanding – is, yes, we make the new healthcare system a bit more expensive, but there’s also an upside. And that’s increasing the military budget.”

“If we increase the military budget, we end up buying better and more effective equipment and weapons for our soldiers when we send them off half way across the world to defend our democracy. The thing is, more lethal soldiers equal a safer country back home. Therefore, if we increase the military budget, we will instantly make the poor at home feel safer than ever before. In turn, they’ll stop trying to steal our money because they’re too scared for their own health. We have to be able to think about the big picture, about things on a larger scale. If they just stop for a second and try to understand what I’m saying, they’ll realize that we’re essentially trying to help them, too – only, we’re going about it more indirectly as opposed to what’s being done right now. Donald Trump is trying to help America, only unlike Barack Obama, he actually cares about what happens to all of its citizens and not just the poor,” he concluded."

His latest attack goes so far as to evoke prisoner imagery to describe her. “When I see her, I see her in an orange jumpsuit, I’m sorry,” he said Tuesday on “The Dom Giordano Program,” a Philadelphia radio show. “Or at least a stripped one.” Giuliani has repeatedly vilified Clinton for the email server debacle, claiming she belongs in jail for her misdeeds. However, following the FBI’s investigation into the issue, she was not indicted.

“You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to figure out she wasn’t acting alone,” he said during the radio show. “I know many people assume that was the case, but it wasn’t. If anybody really believes Barack Obama had no part in this, I can only say I already know who it is your vote is going to, unfortunately. But, make no mistake – Barack Obama is every bit to blame for this as Hillary Clinton. They were in it together; what’s more, I’m convinced that it was Obama who instructed Clinton to set up a private email server.”

Asked if he has any proof to substantiate his allegations, the former New York City mayor argued that he doesn’t, but that “that’s how it usually goes when those in power know you’re after them with vengeance on your mind.” “I had a ton of evidence, but all of it somehow mysteriously vanished from my home. I found no signs of forced entry or any other criminal activity that would indicate they were stolen, so I had no choice and couldn’t call the police. But, I know it was them. Who else could it have been?” he added.

He continued, “But, here’s the thing: they still think they solved the problem by removing the evidence I had collected. Yet, another investigation into our departing president is being prepared. I have several friends in law enforcement agencies that tell me they’re getting ready to arrest and indict President Barack Obama for conspiracy to use private email servers and reveal top-secret documents and communication to outsiders. They’re just waiting or him to officially step down out of respect for his position. And I know for a fact he’s not getting away this time. Neither him, nor his lackey that goes by the name of Hillary Clinton.”

“And just for the record, here’s some interesting stats for ya: approximately 10% of the black population of the United States of America is jailed at any point in time. That might sound like a negligible number, but remember that we’re talking about a country that has a total of around 320 million people,” the former NYC mayor added. “And pretty soon, by the looks of things, 100% of our former black president will be joining them. Coincidentally, I can’t recall having felt more joy and peace than when I spent my days imagining Obama and Hillary Clinton both wearing orange jumpsuits in prison. After all, orange is the new black, as they say,” he tried to sound witty."

This decrease has been attributed to disgruntled police officers frustrated with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who remains at odds with police union chiefs following the fatal shooting of two NYPD officers last week in Brooklyn, Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu.

“Officers Ramos and Liu were killed in an ambush shooting by Ismaaiyl Brinsley on December 20th. Brinsley, a 28-year-old man with a history of mental health problems, had posted on his Instagram feed that he planned to kill two police officers to avenge the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, both unarmed African-Americans killed this year by police.

“De Blasio declined to endorse a grand jury decision not to indict the officer responsible for Garner’s death and has been sympathetic to the wave of protests against policy impunity that followed.

“Hundreds of officers turned their backs as De Blasio spoke at Ramos’s funeral in Queens on Saturday. The funeral for officer Liu will be held on Sunday; Liu was reportedly the first Chinese-American officer to be killed in the line of duty.

“Why would we continue to do our jobs with the treatment we’re getting?,” said Jonathan Crews, 34, an NYPD officer, and added: “we’ve got no support from those who should be supporting and standing up for us the most, and it all makes us wonder why the hell we’re still doing this job.”

He further added: “we all have families to feed and bills to pay; that’s why we’ve decided to go with the climate created by those in power. From now on, we’ll only arrest white people, since it’s obvious that going after everyone equally just isn’t working for the politicians. So, if the people start noticing a decrease in crime in NYC, they’ll know it’s because the NYPD has stopped arresting blacks altogether.”"

White House counsel Kellyanne Conway appeared on NBC’s “TODAY Show” where the tweet was discussed in a very heated exchange between herself and co-anchor Thomas Roberts. Later that morning, Conway hinted that he and others should be out of a job. Appearing on “FOX & Friends,” Conway expressed her disappointment that those in the media who criticized the president’s tweet (or the president himself) remained unfired. And as for his recent criticisms, Conway said, “[…] When you hear things like that and people still keep their jobs, it’s truly remarkable.”

She continued, “When you take a look at the amount of media houses and so-called reporters that are going after the president simply because they don’t like him – which has absolutely nothing to do with the results he’s been getting, on the contrary – you get the feeling that he’s being severely disrespected. The thing is, the moment you mention that to them, they immediately start screaming about democracy and freedom of speech. It’s funny how the previous president allowed members of the press to get accustomed to such behavior. When I say behavior, I mean the type of ungratefulness that every single member of the press has been throwing in Donald Trump’s face. He’s trying to do what’s best for this country and he’s being ridiculed, mocked and insulted for it.”

“The worst part is, it doesn’t end there,” Conway added. “More and more reporters are becoming audacious enough to mention the Trump family, which goes beyond any type of freedom of speech or press. That is just outright disrespectful and needs to be punished. That’s why I’ve decided to make sure to start doing everything in my power to punish those who dare go beyond the limits of professionalism in their jobs. It is one thing to call out the president on something he’s done wrong, but it’s completely another to go after him simply because you don’t like him. I am going to start with Thomas Roberts of NBC, because he is the most recent in a long line of quasi-television hosts who dared to bash on the president simply because the opportunity was there.”

“An example has to be made and we have to start somewhere, so I might as well start with him. He has not only crossed the line, but has also taken it upon himself to bash on a great man for the sake of mere ratings. I am ready to have Thomas Roberts fired because he disrespected the U.S. president after everything Donald Trump promised he would accomplish for the black community in America. That fact alone gives Roberts’ words a particular toxicity, seeing how being ungrateful is something one would typically expect from white people. He needs to learn his lesson and I’m going to make sure of it,” Conway concluded."

Robertson—whose show reaches nearly 1 million viewers a day—said that, since 1969, he’s been wearing an “anti-sodomite” necklace, which, according to Robertson, “repels homosexuals and other queers, and keeps [him] free of their abhorrent lifestyles and gay diseases.”

“With all the gayness poisoning our great nation these days, you might think it’s only by God’s grace that I have managed to remain straight and healthy through it all,” Robertson told his viewers. “But, for once, this was no miracle—I have only my gay-repelling necklace to thank, which has kept all sexual degenerates at least 20 feet away from me for the last 44 years, ever since the stonewall riots convinced me the gays were coming for my heterosexuality.”

Robertson neglected to fully explain the necklace’s powers, revealing only that “it involves hyper-masculine materials, such as moose semen and barbed wire,” but said that he is finally ready to share it with the world. “For only ten easy payments of $59.99, you too can protect yourself from fancy-boy, disease spreading homosexuals,” Robertson said. 700 Club producers expect sales of the necklace to generate substantial funds for the show, which netted over $400 million in donations in 2005 alone.

Robertson’s unveiling came as a response to inquiries concerning comments he made on his show earlier this week. On Tuesday, Robertson used a portion of his show to claim that American homosexuals in cities like San Francisco are intentionally spreading AIDS via “specials rings” that “cut your finger” during handshakes and thereby infect you with the deadly HIV virus. “Really,” the host said. “It’s that kind of vicious stuff, which would be the equivalent of murder.”

“Lots of people wrote in to ask how they can protect themselves from these queer, ring-toting murderers,” Robertson said Thursday. “Well, that made me realize I had to come clean about my anti-gay necklace. It’s time for the world to know.”"

After reviewing post-election polling data, New Jersey research group Just Facts announced that the number of non-citizens voting illegally is considerably more than previous estimates, the Washington Times reported.

In fact, as many as 5.7 million non-citizens may have voted in the 2008 election that gave Barack Obama his first term in the White House.

Just Facts, a non-profit research and educational institute, estimated that as many as 7.9 million non-citizens illegally registered in 2008 and somewhere between 594,000 to 5.7 million actually voted in that year’s presidential election.

So much for Democrats’ claim that voter fraud doesn’t exist.

Oddly enough, these numbers are in line with Trump’s claim about what might have happened in 2016. Trump, who faced merciless ridicule for his claim that millions of illegal-alien voters cost him the nationwide popular vote last November, might have been closer to the truth that even he realized.

If it turns out that Trump was right, then what we have at the heart of this study is the betrayal of every American voter. Because every vote cast illegally can nullify a vote cast by an American citizen, and dilute the entire electoral process.





A system that allows it is betraying American democracy, and every voter should be furious about it.

In May, Trump signed an executive order that established a commission to investigate voter fraud. The Presidential Commission on Election Integrity will review Trump’s allegations as well as “systemic issues that have been raised over many years in terms of the integrity of the elections.”

There’s no telling what the commission will find, but if it reports that our voting system is indeed as broken as these numbers suggest, then we need to know so we can begin the process of fixing it. CONSERVATIVE TRIBUNE"

Dead silence here in Brooklyn bar as patrons watch Comey’s testimony. pic.twitter.com/VhZE2IFcOI — Steve Peoples (@sppeoples) June 8, 2017

Apparently that’s the face you make when you’re tired of losing.

Anyway, Comey’s testimony ended up containing more damning information about Comey than it did Trump. In fact, as we reported yesterday, Comey himself may have admitted to breaking the law when it came to the leaking of his memo that the New York Times quoted in their explosive (and now we know, untrue) report that Trump had asked Comey to cease his investigation into Michael Flynn.

Following his testimony, Trump’s lawyer Marc Kasowitz told the public that “today, Mr. Comey admitted that he unilaterally, and surreptitiously, made unauthorized disclosures to the press of privileged communications with the president,” and that “We will leave it the appropriate authorities to determine whether these leaks should be investigated along with all those others being investigated.”





As it turns out – he works fast. As The Hill reported, President Trump’s outside attorney is planning on filing a complaint against fired FBI Director James Comey with the Justice Department over his handling of memos on his interactions with the president, CNN reported Friday.

Sources tell CNN the complaint surrounds Comey’s testimony Thursday that as a private citizen he relayed the content of his memos about his interactions with Trump to a friend of his, and asked him to give the content to a reporter."

On Friday, the IMF came out with a paper ceding that the Japanese central bank will very quickly run out of assets to purchase, meaning that their massive Quantitative Easing program will grind to a halt, and leaving Japan with no more arrows in their quiver to keep their asset bubbles afloat.

The Bank of Japan may need to reduce the pace of its bond purchases in a few years due to a shortage of sellers, said economists at the International Monetary Fund. There is likely to be a “minimum” level of demand for Japanese government bonds from banks, pension funds, and insurance companies due to collateral needs, asset allocation targets, and asset-liability management requirements, said IMF economists Serkan Arslanalp and Dennis Botman. We construct a realistic rebalancing scenario, which suggests that the BoJ may need to taper its JGB purchases in 2017 or 2018, given collateral needs of banks, asset-liability management constraints of insurers, and announced asset allocation targets of major pension funds. … there is likely to be a “minimum” level of demand for JGBs from banks, pension funds, and insurance companies due to collateral needs, asset allocation targets, and asset-liability management (ALM) requirements. As such, the sustainability of the BoJ’s current pace of JGB purchases may become an issue. – Bloomberg via Zerohedge

This analysis by the IMF however was just the first shot fired going into the U.S.’s Labor Day weekend. Just one day later on Sep. 5, China informed members of the G20 that their stock market bubble had burst, and that they would be needing to engage in more rounds of proactive monetary policies to stem off what is likely to be a long period of financial attrition.

Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of China’s central bank, couldn’t stop repeating to a G-20 gathering that a bubble in his country had “burst.” It came up about three times in his explanation Friday of what is going on with China’s stock market, according to a Japanese finance ministry official. When asked by a reporter if Zhou was talking about a bubble, Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso was unequivocal: “What else bursts?” Chinese stocks have plunged almost 40 percent since a June peak, triggering unprecedented intervention from the authorities. The central bank cut rates for the fifth time since November last month and lowered the amount of cash banks must set aside, falling back on its major levers to support equity prices and the slowing economy. – Bloomberg

What is interesting here is China’s open admission of problems within their equity markets when the mainstream continues to berate their government for not being transparent enough on their economic data. However, this is pure sophistry since the U.S. has been masking their true economic situation for years by changing the goalposts such as the recent double ‘seasonal adjustment’ adaptation to their GDP.

Quantitative Easing by central banks around the world has been for one reason only… to funnel the wealth of nations into the hands of a small elite. And knowing that a global financial death event occurred in 2008, it was inevitable that governments around the world were planning for a shift to a new paradigm in the near future, with just a small window available to undertake this historic looting of wealth. But as we now go seven years into a ‘recovery’ that is based on tens of trillions of dollars in un-sterilized money creation, and zero percent interest rates, the timing of the final collapse may be revealing itself in a cascading fashion, with the monetary masters now completely impotent to deal with the monster they have created.

And with the entire fiat paper financial system tied to this singular foundation of confidence by the people, and in the government, all that was necessary for the greatest empire in history to fail was for the world to lose confidence in that belief.

And now 44 years later, faith in not only the dollar but also in the United States is cracking, and accelerating towards a meltdown that will soon end dollar hegemony within the global financial system. And because of this, the elite are left with few options available them to be able to hold onto their confiscated power. And perhaps the most ironic and convoluted of their schemes is to accelerate the end of that confidence and eliminate the dollar in physical form all together.

September is here. As expected, market volatility is increasing. The Great Zombie War is intensifying. And investors are getting scared. Yes, investors are losing confidence…they’re probably losing confidence in corporate managers, for instance. Who wants to own stock in companies run by numskulls who buy back shares in their companies at record prices just before a major sell-off? Or maybe they’re wondering whether the world’s $200 trillion in total debt (roughly 300% of total output) can possibly be paid back? Or maybe they’re beginning to puzzle out how scammy and fraudulent the Fed’s policies are. In the meantime, watch your rear: There’s a serious counterattack coming. It will be an attack on our supply lines. The cronies and the feds will attempt to cut off our finances and our line of retreat, trapping us between the anvil of the market’s deflation and the hammer of the Fed’s inflation. There will be no escape, no way out. – Bonner and Partners

The counter-attack that this institution is referring to is the ending cash in the economy all together.

Few have learned that the Federal Reserve and central banking systems were created by an oligarchy that used control over the printing of money to control the political and economic mechanisms of sovereign nations. And just as the U.S. central bank took one of the richest nations in the world into bankruptcy just 20 years after its creation, and did the same to Europe in the same period of time after consolidating the continent under the Euro system, the primary goal of a central bank is to funnel the wealth of nations into the hands of a tiny elite, and leave the primary populations in poverty, and in need of government welfare to survive.

This is why the Fed and their paid lackeys in Washington will never admit failure when it comes to their monetary policies because the truth of the matter is that they did not fail at all since their goal was to steal all wealth and move it into the hands of a select few. And with the inevitable and repeatable collapse that is now front and center once again before the economies of the world, the movement to end the use of cash is not an offer to solve global financial problems, but a way to institute the next form of control on the people, since their long stated goals of complete world domination require it.

One must always remember the words of former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt when he said “In politics, nothing happens by accident. If it happens, you can bet it was planned that way.” And since the call to end the use of cash is now coming from multiple fronts, and from multiple sectors of society at a time when central banks, paper assets, and even the dollar are losing the confidence of the people at a rapid pace, it assuredly is a move to consolidate control rather than provide a solution to problems and crises that the elite themselves created for this purpose.

Coming in well below analyst expectations, new jobs created were a lackluster 173,000 bringing the unemployment rate to a level not even seen during the Reagan years when there were less people, and more real opportunities in the economy.

And while 173,000 new jobs, and a 5.1% unemployment rate may be seen as a victory to some who most often never look beyond the headline numbers, the sad fact is 261,000 vanished from even being counted in the job market bringing the labor participation rate to an all time record of 94 million Americans not only out of work, but not even recognized by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

While the kneejerk headling scanning algos are focusing on the seasonally-adjusted headline monthly NFP increase which came in a worse than expected 173K, the presidential candidates – especially the GOP – are far more focused on another data point: the labor force participation rate, and the number of Americans not in the labor force. Here, they will have some serious ammo, because according to the BLS, the main reason why the unemployment rate tumbled to the lowest since April 2008 is because another 261,000 Americans dropped out of the labor force, as a result pushing the total number of US potential workers who are not in the labor force, to a record 94 million, an increase of 1.8 million in the past year, and a whopping 14.9 million since the start of the second great depression in December 2007. – Zerohedge

Yet even as the Obama administration tries to tell the American people how many jobs he has created since he took office following the 2008 Credit Crisis, the markets are not concerned about the fact that only 55% of all Americans eligible within the workforce (15-65) are actually employed and able to find paying work. All that matters is whether the Federal Reserve will decide to raise rates now that the manipulated unemployment rate is far below their announced baseline, and whether the equity bubble charade will collapse due to fear that the era of cheaper money and increased debt may be slowing down.

The real facts are that if you count unemployment the way they did prior to the Clinton administration, the amount of Americans out of work is at least 24%, and more than likely closer to 40%. And thanks to a welfare system that is fueled by debt and over one trillion dollars per year to provide the masses bread and circuses, a large majority of people in the United States who can’t find a real job will continue to be out of sight, and thus, out of mind.

And with our welfare and benefit system growing from a safety net scheme 70 years ago, to now a massive boondoggle encompassing nearly two-thirds of the entire annual budget, eventually something had to crack, and it is coming this time in potentially new increased costs for Medicare premiums for those stuck in fixed incomes.

Nearly a third of the roughly 50 million elderly Americans who depend on Medicare for their physician care and other health services could see their premiums jump by 52 percent or more next year. That’s because of a quirk in the law that punishes wealthier beneficiaries and others any time the Social Security Administration fails to boost the annual cost of living adjustment. Unless Congress or Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell intervenes, an estimated 15 million seniors, first-time beneficiaries or those currently claiming dual Medicare and Medicaid coverage will see their premiums jump from $104.90 per month to $159.30 for individuals, according to an analysis by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. Higher-income couples would pay multiples of that increase. – Yahoo Finance

In addition to a rise in Medicare premium payments of at least 34%, premiums for health insurance under Obamacare are already expected to rise in some cases by as much as 50%.

Like the rise in education costs over the past 30 years, healthcare costs are second on that list of the most inflationary expenditures to both the consumer, and the Federal government. However, in both instances more money spent has resulted in a much worse outcome as Americans rank in the lower 30’s globally in overall literacy, and are 11th in many categories in a ranking of 11 developed nations on their overall healthcare programs.

When a government like the U.S. has the power to print money without being answerable or responsible for where it goes, the end results are almost always inefficiency, and a lack of competitiveness that no longer keeps products and services in check cost wise, and of a quality that is expected in the marketplace. And since the U.S. government has chosen to de facto nationalize healthcare of all Americans, it is no surprise that each year it will continue to cost you more for a coverage that provides you less and less.

Among them are several leaders from the Middle East and from OPEC nations, and it will bring together several parties that have the power to direct energy and military policies going forward for their countries.

But what is of strategic importance, and what could possibly end up being a monumental sea change in the global energy spectrum, is that this week’s event could bring about the plans for an end of the petro-dollar, and a rise of oil and natural gas being sold primarily in Yuan, or even perhaps gold.

The lineup of officials in Moscow tomorrow:King of Jordan, King of KSA, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Egypt’s President, Iranian Vice-President #Breaking: Saudi King Salman will visit Russia on August 25. He’ll attend the MAKS air show along with Putin.

Russia is up to something – Yuri Barman

By pulling together several Arab and Islamic leaders, many of whom are currently at odds with one another, is extremely significant and suggests that there is much at stake for the participants attending this event. For example, discussions over Syria and Iran could be in play, but more than likely, talks on what to do over the price of oil, especially as Saudi Arabia finds itself having to cut its budget because of the global drop in prices, is an extreme probability.

Saudi Arabia is seeking to cut billions of dollars from next year’s budget because of the slump in crude prices, according to two people familiar with the matter. The government is working with advisers on a review of capital spending plans and may delay or shrink some infrastructure projects to save money, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. The government is in the early stages of the review and could look at cutting investment spending, estimated to be about 382 billion riyals ($102 billion) this year, by about 10 percent or more, the people said. Current spending on areas such as public sector salaries wouldn’t be affected, the people said. The Arab world’s largest economy is expected to post a budget deficit of almost 20 percent of gross domestic product this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. With income from oil accounting for about 90 percent of revenue, a more than 50 percent drop in prices in the past 12 months has put pressure on the nation’s finances. The country has raised at least 35 billion riyals from local bond markets this year, the first time it has issued securities with a maturity of over 12 months since 2007. – Zerohedge

With the global economy spiraling towards recession, and nations everywhere devaluing their currencies to protect their remaining lifelines for exports, the countries that rely upon supplying producing nations with commodities such as oil and natural gas are at the precipice of a crisis. And a solution to this may just be a divestiture from the dollar, and the key to unshackling themselves from a future of massive inflation, and from remaining under the thumb of a U.S. foreign policy that less than five years ago, led to an Arab Spring, and chaotic civil unrest.

Yet even with chaos reigning throughout the region, members of the Greek government are now in St. Petersburg finalizing an agreement that will bring a pipeline into their country, and provide needed revenues as a gateway to Europe for energy sent through the Turkstream route.

And with this agreement could be the beginning of a new alliance between Russia, Greece, and the BRICS.

Greece is expecting to sign a preliminary agreement for the country’s participation in Russia’s planned extension of a gas pipeline through Greek territory, Greek energy ministry officials said Thursday. Meanwhile, Russian gas giant OAO Gazprom said it had reached a preliminary deal with three European energy companies to double the capacity of a gas pipeline that takes Russian gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea. State-controlled Gazprom said it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Royal Dutch Shell, Germany’s E. ON and Austria’s OMV AG to add two lines to the Nord Stream pipeline, opened in 2011 as part of a Russian strategy to circumvent transit countries such as Ukraine. The potential Greek-Russian agreement, which wouldn’t be legally binding, is expected to be signed Friday during Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’ visit to an economic conference in St. Petersburg. – Wall Street Journal

It is already clear that Germany and the Troika will not budge on their demands for further austerity measures to re-do the debt, and perhaps even provide new funding for an insolvent Greece. But while the rhetoric continues to fly from both sides of the aisle, Prime Minister Tsipris appears not to be sitting by idly, and is leaving open several options that might include a return to the Drachma, and a full on alliance with BRICS for new trade and economic programs.

The coming pipeline agreement with Russia is a life jacket to Greece, and a major thorn in the side for Europe. For this partnership would be only the beginning, where future agreements could expand into port leasing right on the border of NATO, and even a huge free trade zone right on the edge of the entire Eurozone.

Next week, I’ll be opening the webmaster URL submit page for the world’s first independent, anti-propaganda search engine that filters out corporate propaganda and government disinformation. The search engine is free to submit to and free to use. It’s funded entirely by advertising that appears on the search results page.

Uniquely, this independent search engine either bans or flags (with a warning) all corporate propaganda and government disinfo websites. Just as Google flags search result URLs containing malicious code that can infect your computer, we will flag search result URLs containing malicious propaganda that can infect your mind.

This means you won’t find the CDC’s vaccine propaganda dominating search results, for example. Instead, you’ll find a universe of independent websites that have been suppressed, censored or outright banned by Google. You’ll also be able to help protect the integrity of the search results by flagging corporate propaganda and government disinfo using the clickable feedback icons present on the search results pages.

It’s time for a credible alternative to the “New Evil Empire”

Why is this needed? Google is now known as “the new evil empire” according to this Fox Business article. It quotes Google Chairman Eric Schmidt as saying:

We don’t need you to type at all because we know where you are. We know where you’ve been. We can more or less guess what you’re thinking about … Is that over the line?

“Google may very well be the most sinister threat and wicked incarnation of them all,” writes Fox Business author Steve Tobak. “The Google Empire is expanding into everything from self-driving cars and virtual reality to broadband fiber and neural networks. It’s even collecting genetic and molecular information from thousands of people to map humans in a way that’s eerily reminiscent of how it maps the world’s streets.”

The search engine I’m launching engages in NO surveillance of users. It does not record your search history or click history, nor does it link your IP address to any activity. Instead of spying on you, it protects your privacy while delivering far more accurate and truthful independent search results from non-corporate-controlled information sources.

Google is actively punishing truth-telling websites that diverge from “official” sources

In addition to functioning as the police state surveillance branch of the NSA, Google is actively censoring Independent Media websites, punishing those sites’ rankings merely because they challenge the propaganda and fraud of the status quo.

Google’s search results are now determined by each page’s so-called “factiness” — a new algorithm that punishes all content which disagrees with official sources such as the criminally operated CDC, the pharma-controlled science journals, and biotech-infiltrated universities. Independent, truthful information is now punished in Google rankings, a search engine which has abandoned ranking based on merit and is now pushing rankings based on propaganda.

This shift effectively makes Google a real-life Ministry of Truth that censors the truth and promotes corporate propaganda (and government disinfo), all while spying on you to boot. It’s a lose-lose proposition: At the same time you are handing over your psychological profile to the search engine, it’s also filling your mind with lies disguised as “facts” from official sources. Think about it: Google heavily promotes Wikipedia, a discredited disinfo and defamation website largely edited by corporate-funded trolls hiding behind anonymity. Even though Wikipedia was co-founded by a “porn king” and carried child porn imagery on its site, Google gives it high rankings while punishing the independent media websites that actually publish the truth.

Google also strongly favors mainstream media news sources — precisely the news outlets that spew the most blatant disinformation about everything that matters: Central Banks, government debt, politics, economics, health care, immigration, crime, culture and more. Virtually all news sites that print the truth have been systematically removed from Google News over the last few years, and there is little doubt that Google plans to effectively remove all “alternative” websites from its index by penalizing them into oblivion.

On top of all that, Google is of course an extension of the NSA. It monitors your searches to build a psychological profile of who you are and how you think. Google has become the Orwellian surveillance apparatus it once assured us it could never be. And more than ever, the need now exists for a committed, trusted, alternative search engine that focuses on indexing independent, truth-telling websites rather than the lying “official sources” that Google strangely considers to be “trustworthy sources.” (If you trust CNN or MSNBC on anything, you probably need to have your head examined…)

The first search engine that launches with a Code of Ethics

This search engine will be the first in the world that launches with a Code of Ethics, outlining the permanent boundaries and limits of what the engine will do.

I’m still working on the final Code of Ethics guidelines, but they will cover these key areas:

• No indexing of sites promoting porn, gambling or Big Pharma.

• No surveillance of users and no storage of search history from users.

• No sharing of search data with the NSA or other spooks.

• No “gaming” of search results to favor my own projects (such as Natural News).

Created to support the courageous voices across the Independent Media

For over 13 years, I’ve been one of the top voices in the Independent Media, speaking out with truth-telling articles on the big issues of our day such as vaccine mandates, health freedom, food freedom, the coming global debt collapse, constitutional rights and civil liberties. Over this time, I’ve watched the rise of the Independent Media which has earned far higher viewership and trust than the old-school “mainstream media”.

There are so many powerful voices of truth emerging today that it’s just astonishing to watch them work. Some of my favorite voices are people like Aaron Dykes and Melissa Melton from TruthStreamMedia.com and Jon Rappoport from NoMoreFakeNews.com. I’m also, of course, a huge fan of Robert Scott Bell at NaturalNewsRadio.com. But there are so many more that are also deserving of some public recognition, too.

The point is there are tens of thousands of courageous, independent voices of truth who are joining the fight for humanity by printing the truth about the corporate poisoners and Big Brother government. My aim with this search engine project is to help give these voices of truth a platform for increased exposure. While Google is censoring and silencing voices of courage and truth, I want to empower them with a new search engine that will actually favor their content over the lying mainstream media.

So for all of you in the Independent Media, you’re invited to submit your site URL and get indexed. This new search engine could become a dominant source for your web traffic, especially as Facebook is clearly experimenting with its own “publisher kill switch” that can cause all independent publishers to immediately lose all Facebook traffic.

The day is probably not too far off when Google and Facebook ban all independent media websites. When that day comes, it’s projects like the one I’m launching that will be the last remaining portals to real journalism and independent reporting. (For this reason, the entire project is also being mirrored offshore as well as hosted domestically.)

We’ll be opening up the submit page this week. Stay tuned to Natural News this week for details on this launch.

Help us spread the word across the Independent Media so that webmasters, bloggers and independent journalists know this is coming. Finally! A place where their efforts will be recognized rather than suppressed…"

These episodes have been filled with these crappy plot holes and now after Episode 2 of Season 7, I have to call out the show. It will be too bad if the ending of such a great show takes this course.

Last night’s episode was a good example of this. Take, for instance, the final scene of the episode. Dany has instructed Yara to take Ellaria and the Sand Snakes back to Dorne to muster an army. Immediately this is problematic to me.

Sunspear is located at the southern tip of Westeros. Dragonstone is much further north, and very close to King’s Landing. Let’s take a look at a map:

Map by sanjota on DeviantArt

See how Sunspear is located in a nice secure bay, far south of King’s Landing and Cersei’s armies? See how Dragonstone is basically just across the water from King’s Landing?

To get all the way to Dragonstone from Slaver’s Bay, Dany would have to sail right past the Dornish capital. It would be an easy stop along the way, and the perfect place to meet up with Dany’s allies.

So why on earth didn’t she stop there to discuss her plans for invading King’s Landing and taking the Seven Kingdoms? Why sail all the way to Dragonstone if her plan was to then have most of her force sail south again?

Olenna was already in Dorne, forming her own alliance between House Tyrell and the Martells (or, well, the Sands.) Dany could have stopped at Sunspear, well protected in the Sea of Dorne, where she could have conveyed plans for her allies to march against King’s Landing.

This way, Yara wouldn’t have had to take Ellaria back to Dorne. They’d be there already! Grey Worm wouldn’t have had to sail all the way to Dragonstone and then all the way back down and around to Casterly Rock, either. He could have just left from Sunspear! Even Olenna would have had an easier time returning to Highgarden to muster her armies. (Though she can teleport, so no biggie.)

…

From a narrative perspective, this is horribly contrived writing. There’s only one reason to do it: To place Yara and Ellaria in danger and have Euron capture them. That is literally the only reason, and it’s a very, very bad one.

What we’re seeing here is not a consequence of a character’s actions, but rather a consequence arranged by the writers to conveniently push the story in a direction they wanted it to go. There was no debate between Tyrion and Dany about stopping in Dorne. This isn’t the consequence of a stubborn Queen, foolishly demanding that her court is held in Dragonstone. It’s just…well, I’m sorry, but it’s just bad, sloppy writing. I’m very disappointed by it.

Actions have consequences in Martin’s books, and now more than ever I miss those books and wish (and pray to the Seven!) that he’d hurry up and finish The Winds of Winter already, so we could have his careful plotting and characterization back, as opposed to this rather hurried imitation.

I say this as a really big fan of the show. I often defend the changes the show makes from the books, and sometimes I think they can even be better (or at least better for a TV audience.) But this is not one of those times. Indeed, the way this was rushed and set up has me really worried that the rest of the show will take similarly predictable and contrived approaches.

Winterfell

Here’s another example. Sansa. Sansa was just reunited with her brother (“brother”) Jon Snow last season after escaping horrible abuse at the hands of Ramsay Bolton, who she was sold off to by Littlefinger. But instead of arresting Littlefinger, or sending him away, she publicly opposes Jon in court numerous times. In both the last two episodes she publicly disagrees with him in a way that just…it doesn’t make sense. This is the sort of thing Tywin Lannister would never allow. It’s not her place to question her brother, the King in the North, in front of all his assembled lords and ladies. These are the sorts of conversations that would take place in the war room, in relative privacy.

The show throws them in there, abundantly, to set up what I believe to be a really awful conflict between Sansa and Jon, with Littlefinger in there stirring the pot. It’s not that Sansa is even wrong, it’s that the show wants so badly to create more courtroom politics that they’re undermining how these characters would actually behave. I think Sansa would be so relieved to be safe for the first time in years, at home with Jon finally and out of the clutches of Ramsay and Joffrey, that she’d be less inclined to screw him over in front of his bannermen.

And make no mistake, that’s exactly what she’s doing. She’s undermining him left and right, when she’s the one person who should have his back more than anyone else. This all started with the Battle of the Bastards, when she didn’t tell him about the Knights of the Vale, and only brought them to bear when Jon was very nearly dead already.

I don’t like it, not because it’s two of the story’s “good guys” butting heads, but because there’s literally no reason for them to do so. Sansa isn’t stupid, but the show sure wants us to think she is for some reason.

Queen’s Landing

Or take Cersei’s new dragon-killing technology that’s…just a basic ballista. This would almost certainly already have been invented given how far along Westeros society is, with massive fortresses and presumably the siege technology to defend and attack them. Besides, it’s one thing to hit a dragon’s skull when the creature is dead, and quite another to aim a ballista at a moving, flying target. Good luck with that, Qyburn.

Then there’s Dany trying to cow Varys and threatening to burn him alive, and acting like a real tyrant by summoning Jon Snow to “bend the knee.” What on earth is the show trying to do with this character? I have no idea at this point. She’s utterly unlikable, a Mad Queen in the making, but still propped up as some wonderful savior. Varys and Tyrion and all her other sidekicks love her to pieces, but she’s acting like a villain. It doesn’t add up.

In Sum

I miss the books, where at least you could follow the logic behind every character’s decision, whether wise or foolish, wicked or noble. I miss the books where things didn’t just happen so that the plot would move forward. I miss the books where naval battles actually made sense. Last night’s we had Euron miraculously finding Yara’s fleet in the dark, in the middle of the night, then picking out her exact ship and boarding it. He’s also able to burn her entire fleet without her even attempting to run away, and without setting fire to his own ships. Right.

And before you show up in the comments talking about how there’s magical White Walkers and Dragons and this is a Fantasy so I should stop worrying about all this, no. No that’s just wrong. What made the books and the early seasons of this show so great was the fact that there’s an internal logic, an internal consistency that holds the world together. Human conflicts born out of human actions. Plausible characters making the best choices they could even when they were wrong. All the fantasy trappings add flavor without disrupting the realism of the story itself.

All the best fantasies do this. Tolkien isn’t “gritty” the same way that Martin is, but his characters still behave like real people. The human conflicts are still the most interesting. Boromir’s betrayal is still, in my mind, among the most powerful scenes in all fiction.

So I’m worried. The first episode of the season was great, but this was a really big letdown. And it’s hardly the first time the show has made similarly bad choices about how to navigate the story."

Winner’s mother, Billie Winner-Davis, told The Daily Beast even after the DOJ announcement that her family still was not sure why Winner had been arrested.

“I don’t know what they’re alleging,” she said, asking for specifics from the DOJ’s press release. “What do you know?”

Winner-Davis said the allegations against her daughter were vague when they spoke Sunday.

“I don’t know who she might have sent it to,” she said. “[DOJ] were very vague. They said she mishandled and released documents that she shouldn’t have, but we had no idea what it pertained to or who.”

The most her daughter talked about was her pets.

“She called us yesterday night. She asked if we could help out with relocating her cat and dog,” Winner-Davis said.

Winner-Davis said her daughter never talked about her work, and her family did not know the specifics of her recently acquired job as a government contractor. Winner-Davis added that her daughter, while quiet about her job, was outspoken about her beliefs.

“She’s very passionate. Very passionate about her views and things like that, but she’s never to my knowledge been active in politics or any of that,” said Winner-Davis.

On Twitter, Reality Winner expressed frequent dissatisfaction with President Donald Trump’s policies and retweeted a joke about government leaks, as well as a tweet by whistleblower Edward Snowden.

In recent months, she frequently tweeted at Trump. “have you ever even met an Iranian?” she responded to Trump when he tweeted that immigrants coming from seven Muslim-majority countries were “SO DANGEROUS.”

She tweeted “#RESISTANCE” after the U.S. Department of Agriculture began blacking out public information. Immediately after Trump’s election, she took to Twitter to voice her disappointment. “I listened to you daily, and your podcast kept me sane,” she wrote at the FiveThirtyEight podcast on Nov. 9, 2016. “What the heck #betrayed #disillusioned.” She tweeted Sen. Bernie Sanders’ statement calling Trump racist and xenophobic immediately after.

On election night, she tweeted, “Well. People suck.”

Winner is a U.S. Air Force veteran. As a parting gift in November, she wrote, her colleagues gave her a signed and framed photograph of Anderson Cooper, which she showed off in a Facebook post.

“Thank you for your service,” her colleagues wrote on the picture.

It is unclear when Winner might be able to seek bond, her mother said.

“She has a hearing on Thursday about that,” Winner-Davis said.

Garrick’s affidavit indicates that Winner’s arrest was speedy—just a few weeks after she allegedly leaked the report—because she printed out the document and sent an email to The Intercept.

When reporters received the document in the mail, they asked for comment from the intelligence agency that produced it (presumably the National Security Agency, or NSA). And they showed the agency a copy of the document. The copy had visible creases, according to the affidavit, indicating someone printed it out before giving it to the reporters. Investigators found that only six people had printed the report. Of those six, only one had had contact with the news outlet that ultimately published it, according to the affidavit: Winner.

Garrick wrote that he went to Winner’s home in Augusta, Georgia, on June 3, and she acknowledged to him that she mailed the report to the media outlet.

Mark Zaid, a national security lawyer who frequently handles classified matters, told The Daily Beast that Winner is not a whistleblower.

“It is titillating for everyone with respect to political bent as to whether the elections were stolen, perhaps,” he said. “But it has absolutely nothing to do with any waste, fraud, abuse, or—more importantly—illegal U.S. government conduct to justify leaking it.”

Zaid added that Winner also likely would have faced charges under the previous administration and that her arrest doesn’t necessarily portend a crackdown on whistleblowers.

“I think the Obama administration would have prosecuted this same case without hesitation,” he said. “It’s not a partisan political prosecution. It is a case that upholds the lawful obligations that those who have access to classified information adhere to every single day.”

Patrick Toomey, an attorney at the ACLU’s National Security Project, took a different view and said the arrest could be a cause for concern.

“Leaks to journalists occur every day, as they have for decades, and are a vital source of information for the public in our democracy,” he said. “It would be deeply troubling if this prosecution marked the beginning of a draconian crackdown on leaks to the press by the Trump administration.”

Classified leaks have rattled the Trump administration since before the president was inaugurated, and he has promised to find the leakers. Trump surrogates frequently refer to them as the “Deep State.” And political appointees at the Justice Department are eager to prosecute leakers.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions has made numerous public comments about his support of leak prosecutions, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein worked on the successful leak-related prosecution of James Cartwright, a former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

But the Obama administration set the precedent, prosecuting more leakers than all other administrations put together."

Senate Committee on the Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley has launched a new investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s effort to thwart a Bangladesh government corruption probe of Muhammad Yunus, a Clinton Foundation donor and close friend of the Clintons.

The Iowa Republican’s effort is the first new official inquiry of Clinton since her unexpected loss in the 2016 presidential election to President Donald Trump. Trump’s supporters often chanted “lock her up” during his many boisterous campaign rallies.

But upon assuming the presidency, Trump and leaders of the Republican-majority Congress displayed little appetite for reopening investigations of Clinton’s tenure as the chief U.S. diplomat and multiple persistent allegations of “pay-to-play” corruption involving the Clinton Foundation. Until now.

The Daily Caller News Foundation (TheDCNF) Investigative Group exclusively reported in May that Clinton sent top U.S. diplomats to pressure Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheik Hasina and her son Sajeeb Wazed in an effort to kill that country’s corruption investigation of Yunus and Grameen Bank. Yunus was then managing director of the state-owned Bangladesh bank.

In a June 1, 2017, letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Grassley repeated TheDCNF charge that Clinton threatened Wazed with an IRS tax audit if his mother did not back away from the corruption probe. Wazed has lived in the U.S. for 17 years.

“If the Secretary of State used her position to intervene in an independent investigation by a sovereign government simply because of a personal and financial relationship stemming from the Clinton Foundation rather than the legitimate foreign policy interests of the United States, then that would be unacceptable,” Grassley told Tillerson.

“Co-mingling her official position as Secretary of State with her family foundation would be similarly inappropriate. It is vital to determine whether the State Department had any role in the threat of an IRS audit against the son of the Prime Minister in retaliation for this investigation,” Grassley continued.

Grassley described how U.S. ambassadors James Moriarty and Dan Mozena, as well as Jon Danilowica, the Deputy Chief of Mission, met with Wazed in the U.S. Embassy in Dhaka, Bangladesh’s capital, on numerous occasions while the corruption investigation was underway. All three are career diplomats.

Another official, U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Administrator Rajiv Shah also met with Wazed. Shah’s agency awarded $13 million to Yunus organizations and another $11 million to allied Yunus organizations during Clinton’s tenure. The Department of State oversees USAID programs.

As TheDCNF previously reported, Clinton’s aid to Yunus included 18 grants, contracts and loans awarded to two of his America-based foundations, the Grameen Foundation USA and Grameen America, according to USASpending.gov.

Yunus was stripped of his directorship of the state owned Grameen Bank in 2011 as a result of the Bangladesh government’s review of his financial mismanagement of the bank and its “micro-credit” loan program for poor peasants, mainly women.

A Norwegian documentary charging Yunus personally diverted $100 million intended for Grameen Bank and for the poor to his other organizations triggered the initial investigation against him. The pocketing of funds shocked many in poverty-stricken Bangladesh where the annual per capita income is about $3,600, according to the World Bank.

Yunus eventually returned the money to Grameen Bank, but the government’s investigation exposed serious financial mismanagement and found the micro-loan program failed to lift recipients out of poverty. He was forced to resign under a law making 60 the maximum age for the bank’s top position. Yunus was 70 at the time.

Interest rates and payback amounts of the micro-loans sometimes resulted in more poverty, not less. Rather than re-paying the loans, a number of recipients in Bangladesh and India committed suicide.

Clinton’s support for Yunus dates to former President Bill Clinton’s years as Arkansas governor. Both Clintons became micro-credit loan advocates and enthusiastic backers of Yunus, who invented the lending scheme. Bill Clinton reportedly lobbied the Nobel Prize Committee on behalf of Yunus. The committee awarded him the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize.

From 2008 onward, Yunus was a featured speaker at the glitzy Clinton Global Initiative’s annual meeting. He donated between $100,000-$250,000 to CGI and $25,000-$50,000 to the Clinton Foundation, according to the Clinton Foundation website.

Wazed told TheDCNF it was “astounding and mind boggling” to him that between 2010 and 2012 senior State Department officials repeatedly pressured him to influence his mother to drop the Grameen Bank investigation.

“They threatened me with the possibility of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service,” Wazed said. “They would say over and over again, ‘Yunus has powerful friends’ and we all knew they were talking of Secretary Clinton. Everybody knew it was Mrs. Clinton.”

Grassley noted in his letter to Tillerson that Wazed recounted for Senate investigators “two conversations with then-Deputy Chief of Mission to Bangladesh Jon Danilowicz during which Danilowicz mentioned that Wazed may be audited by the IRS if he failed to use his influence to get his mother to drop the investigation into Yunus.”

Grassley added new details stating, “Furthermore, he was told by these same officials that Yunus was communicating with Secretary Clinton and her staff for assistance and, in turn, Secretary Clinton’s staff put pressure on the Embassy in Bangladesh to intercede on Yunus’ behalf.”

The World Bank also unexpectedly decided during Clinton’s tenure in 2012 to rescind a $1.2 billion loan to Bangladesh while the IRS was pressuring Wazed. The funds were sought to build a key bridge near Dhaka.

Clinton’s inner circle of State Department aides kept her apprised of developments throughout the probe. When Clinton confident Melanne Verveer told her of Yunus’ resignation on May 14, 2011, the former secretary of state described it as “sad indeed.”

In 2016, Grassley complained about the Clinton Foundation to former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and to the FBI regarding public corruption charges. However, this is the first time since Trump took office that Grassley renewed an investigation into Clinton, this time for her retaliatory actions against Bangladesh on behalf of Yunus.

Grassley requested that Tillerson provide the judicial panel with all related emails and State Department records or communications by June 15. The senator also asked if the matter had been referred to the Department of Justice or the State Department’s Inspector General. “If not, why not?” Grassley asked Tillerson.

Maj. Gen. Charles Frank Bolden, Jr said NASA is set to release new details this week about the agency’s “unprecedented” mission to “touch the sun.”

The mission, Solar Probe Plus, will launch in summer of 2018 and marks the agency’s first mission to fly into the sun’s atmosphere. Data collected during the mission is expected to improve forecasting of space weather events that impact life on Earth and the lives of astronauts, NASA said in a statement.

“Placed in orbit within four million miles of the sun’s surface, and facing heat and radiation unlike any spacecraft in history, the spacecraft will explore the sun’s outer atmosphere and make critical observations that will answer decades-old questions about the physics of how stars work,” NASA said in a statement.

NASA will make the announcement live on NASA Television and the agency’s website at 11 a.m. ET on Wednesday.

Liberals are constantly bemoaning the Trump base as the angry, last gasps of the White male. That without the disgruntled rural whites, Trump would have had no shot at winning. But this ignores the realities that the left is still having trouble coming to terms with: that Trump won THANKS TO Minority voters.

Trump performed slightly worse with White voters than Romney did. He did far better with the african american vote though, beating both Romney and McCain. His numbers are actually on par with George W Bush in 2000. And he won 30% of the hispanic vote, the best a GOP candidate for President has done with hispanic voters in a long time.

Trump claimed 29 percent of the Hispanic vote on Tuesday compared to Romney’s 27 percent in 2012. With blacks, exit polls show Trump claimed 8 percent of the vote to the previous Republican nominee’s 6 percent.

That means Trump — who liberals swore would lose because of his tough immigration policies — garnered more support from Hispanics than a candidate whose most controversial position was telling undocumented immigrants to “self-deport.”

As for Hillary, she did horrible among minorities, even those who didn’t want Trump.

In dozens of rural counties throughout the Southwest, Clinton performed worse in 2016 than Obama did in 2012, as you can see in the figure below. In Guadalupe County, N.M., about an hour’s drive east of Albuquerque, she received 17 percent less of the vote than Obama did four years ago — 53 percent compared with Obama’s 70 percent. In several other counties where Hispanics accounted for half to nearly all of the population — Rio Arriba, N.M.; Costilla, Colo.; Greenlee, Ariz.; and Duval, Tex., for example — Clinton took home roughly 10 percent fewer votes than did Obama in 2012. In many more heavily Latino counties, her votes lagged behind Obama’s by 3 to 8 points.

Even in the South Texas counties that Latino Decisions has named bulwarks of Clinton support — the Rio Grande Valley below San Antonio, where she won between 70 and 85 percent of the vote — she didn’t do as well as Obama had done four years earlier. In Brooks County, which, according to the 2015 American Community Survey, is 89.5 percent Hispanic, Clinton’s tally was 3.9 percent less than Obama’s. In Zavala County, which is 93.1 percent Hispanic, it was 5.6 percent less. In Duval County, which is 88.8 percent Hispanic, it was 9.8 percent less.

Meanwhile, as you can see below, Trump did much better among Hispanics in the rural Southwest than Romney did. He received a greater share of the vote than Romney had in more than a dozen counties with large Hispanic populations: six percent more than Romney in Starr County, Tex., which is 95.8 percent Hispanic; 7.5 percent more in Costilla County, N.M., which is 63.6 percent Hispanic; and 9.1 percent more in Duval County, Texas, which is 88.8 percent Hispanic.

Clinton may have received more votes than Obama did in many parts of South Texas, where, as a politically-motivated student at Yale Law School, she knocked on doors in predominantly Mexican neighborhoods for the McGovern campaign. But Trump also received more votes in South Texas than Romney did. Clinton rallied thousands more voters, but so did Trump. His supporters there matched the enthusiasm of Clinton’s, just as they did in dozens of rural counties with large Hispanic populations in New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, and Texas.

The left will never admit this, and even now are trying to pin the blame on racist white people for Trump’s election. But the facts are, Trump won all Americans. Not just white ones.

LANAO DEL SUR, Philippines – Marawi City’s Amai Pakpak Avenue has had more soldiers than residents. So have the other streets in the city proper. Since the military started hunting down members of the Maute Group and other terrorists.

on Tuesday, May 23, Lanao del Sur’s capital has been a ghost town.

An eerie silence enveloped major junctions in what was supposed to be the center of trade and activity in the province and home to more than 200,000 people on Thursday, when Rappler took these photos. It was the first time a few media people were able to slip into the besieged city.

Schools and jail had been burned down, mosque and chapels were closed, hospital sieged. Some residents were taken hostage by the terrorists, and later rescued by government forces.

Thousands of residents have fled Marawi to the relative safety of Iligan in Lanao del Norte, and of Cagayan de Oro in Misamis Oriental, enduring hours-long traffic and military checkpoints.

Still, some decided to stay to watch over their closed shops and houses, but later begged that they be brought food and water.

And for every morning that they stayed, explosions and gunshots would wake them up.

President Rodrigo Duterte visited the troops in Iligan City Friday afternoon, May 26, giving them marching orders to arrest every person carrying firearms without authorization, and to shoot them when they fight back.

“Sasamahan ko kayo (I’ll be with you all the way). If you go down, I go down. But for this martial law and the consequences of martial law, and the ramifications of martial law, I and I alone would be responsible. Trabaho lang [kayo]. Ako na bahala (Just do you job, I have your back),” he said.

His defense secretary, Delfin Lorenzana, set a target: the siege of Marawi will be over in a week or less.

The media is going crazy that President Trump shared intelligence on ISIS with Russia, but in 2016 when Obama was President it was a different story.

The headline from 2016 on US cooperation with Russia on sharing top secret intelligence was much more positive then it is now. President Trump meanwhile is defending his decision to share sensitive information about an Islamic State threat with Russian officials.

President Trump focused instead on justifying what he did and blaming those who disclosed it. In a series of early-morning posts on Twitter, he said he had the “absolute right” to give “facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety” to Russia’s foreign minister and ambassador.

Asked about the conversation by reporters during a later appearance with Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president of Turkey, Mr. Trump again did not deny providing the information, but he instead cast it as an attempt to collaborate with Russia in the war against the Islamic State. “We’re going to have a lot of great success over the coming years, and we want to get as many to fight terrorism as possible,” he said.

At dawn on a warm September morning in 2013, a minivan pulled up to a shattered villa in the town of Azaz, Syria. A long-bearded 29-year-old white man emerged from the building, along with his pregnant British wife and their three children, ages 8, 4, and almost 2. They had been in Syria for only about a month this time. The kids were sick and malnourished. The border they’d crossed from Turkey into Syria was minutes away, but the passage back was no longer safe. They clambered into the minivan, sitting on sheepskins draped on the floor—there were no seats—and the driver took them two hours east through a ravaged landscape, eventually stopping at a place where the family might slip into Turkey undetected.

They disembarked amid a grove of thorny trees. Signs warned of land mines. The border itself was more than an hour’s walk away, through the desert. They’d forgotten to bring water. Tania dragged the puking kids along; Yahya carried a suitcase and a stroller. Midway, Tania had contractions, although she was still several months from her due date. They continued on. At the border itself, while the family squeezed through the barbed wire, a sniper’s bullets kicked up dirt nearby.

Yahya had arranged for a human trafficker to meet them, and when the trafficker’s truck arrived, Yahya pressed a few hundred dollars into the man’s hand. Yahya and Tania had been married for 10 years, but they did not say goodbye. Satisfied that his family would not die, Yahya turned and ran across the border, back into Syria—again under gunfire—without even a wave.

The trafficker drove Tania and the kids a short distance into Turkey, then dropped them by the roadside without food or water and sped off. Tania carried the children and luggage toward the nearest town. The day ended with the intercession of a stranger on a motorcycle, who helped carry their things to a bus station. Tania started to leak amniotic fluid due to the journey, and she spent the next weeks recovering in Istanbul, and then with family in London. Six months pregnant, she weighed 96 pounds.

As his family traveled to London, relieved to have escaped the worst place on Earth, Yahya felt relief of his own—he could now pursue his dreams unencumbered by a wife and children. He felt liberated. He carried visions of the caliphate yet to be declared, and ideas for how to shape it. These thoughts were not idle. Yahya, by then, had a small but influential following, and his calm erudition had won him the respect that his teachers and parents had withheld during his youth. His own destiny seemed to be converging with that of the world’s. It was the best day of his life.

first heard the name Yahya Abu Hassan in 2014, while reporting on an article for this magazine about the rise of the Islamic State. I was in a suburb of Melbourne, talking with Musa Cerantonio, an Australian convert to Islam who has served as an unofficial spiritual guide to many English-speaking followers of the group, about its history and theology. (He is now in jail, charged with attempting to travel to Islamic State territory.)

In our earliest conversations, Cerantonio mentioned a fellow convert—a “teacher” or “leader,” he called him—who had done much to prepare Muslims for the religious obligations that would kick in once a caliphate had been established. Cerantonio spoke of his teacher with awe. Yahya was deeply devoted to the idea of the caliphate, he said, and showed a staggering mastery of Islamic law and classical Arabic language and literature. Jihadists in Syria knew him by reputation, and they honored him when they met him.

Cerantonio said that in early 2014, Yahya had pressed the leaders of what was then the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (isis) to declare a caliphate. He began preaching that the conditions for the declaration of a valid caliphate had been met—the group held and governed territory, and its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was a physically and mentally fit male of Qurayshi descent, capable of ruling according to Sharia. Delaying further would mean disregarding a fundamental obligation of Islam.

Yahya had developed a relationship with Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, the group’s spokesman, chief strategist, and director of foreign terror operations. “Yahya was like this with Adnani,” Cerantonio told me, pressing his fingers together. Yahya met with Adnani near Aleppo and warned him that Baghdadi would be in a state of sin if he did not promote himself to caliph immediately. Yahya and his allies had prepared but not yet sent a letter to the emirs of the isis provinces, airing their displeasure at his failure to do so. They were ready to make war on Baghdadi if he delayed further. Adnani replied with good news—that a caliphate had already been declared secretly, months before, and that it would soon be publicly announced.

Yahya shared the update with Cerantonio, who leaked word of the caliphate declaration on Facebook. Within weeks the official public declaration took place in Mosul, Iraq, and Yahya immediately pledged himself to Baghdadi, urging others to do likewise.

The figure of Yahya—an English-speaking convert within isis with powerful connections and the cojones to challenge Baghdadi to a death match—intrigued me. But Cerantonio didn’t elaborate on his identity and referred to him only by an alias, in the traditional Arabic style, with his first name and the name of his firstborn: Yahya, father of Hassan. He said Yahya was a fellow Dhahiri—a member of an obscure, ultra-literalist legal school that had enjoyed a sort of revival within the Islamic State. He didn’t, or wouldn’t, say more. I wrote down the name and committed to investigating Yahya later.

Americans are known to have traveled to Syria as jihadists. Most are knuckleheads. Yahya, it seemed, was unique.

Soon enough, I began collecting clues to his identity. In early 2015, a pro–Islamic State Twitter user (his handle identified him as a “swordsman”) wrote to me and advised me to contact “Abu Yahya” to learn more about the group. The name resembled Yahya Abu Hassan’s closely enough to lead me to believe he was the same person Cerantonio had mentioned. The Twitter user claimed Yahya was Greek. “He is on the field”—in the war zone—“and part of the IS,” the swordsman wrote. “A great mind and a trustworthy student.”

He then shared a link to a website that featured a collection of Dhahiri writings by Cerantonio and a few others—including a “Yahya al-Bahrumi.” In fluent Arabic and English, Yahya wrote prolifically about many jihadist subjects. He projected calm even in his most grotesque opinions, and wore the label irhabi (“terrorist”) with pride:

This word (“terrorist”) has also been cast as an insult and has been received as such. But irhab [“terror”] itself is something notable scholars have declared obligatory and supported verbatim by the Qur’an itself.

He called for emigration to lands where Sharia would be fully enforced, and wrote that choosing not to emigrate was a form of apostasy:

Call me extreme, but I would imagine that all of those who willingly choose to live among those with whom Muslims are at war are themselves at war with Muslims—and as such, are not actually Muslims. Get out if you can—not only in support of your brothers and sisters whom your taxes have been killing, but also to protect yourselves from the punishment Allah has ordained for those who betray the nation.

He called for Muslims to hate, fight, and kill infidels—among whom, he said, were many so-called Muslims who nullified their faith by neglecting prayer, deviating from the narrow literalism of his interpretation of scripture, or, in the case of rulers, not instituting the brutal system of justice for which the Islamic State was then becoming famous.

In dozens of articles posted over several years, Yahya demonstrated knowledge of classical Arabic—the notoriously difficult language of educated religious speech—and familiarity with Islamic sources and history. His Arabic was stunning even to Cerantonio, an extremely self-confident religious autodidact. Cerantonio told me that another Muslim in their internet discussion group had once challenged a theological point Yahya had made. “Then Yahya did something that shocked us all,” Cerantonio said. “He responded to the guy in traditional Arabic poetry that he devised off the top of his head, using the guy’s name in the poetry, explaining the situation, and answering his objections.” For any claim, it seemed, Yahya could instantly spout textual support, and confronted with any counterclaim, he could undercut the argument with a sweep of the leg.

The website the swordsman had pointed me to included a narrative biography and a small photo of Yahya, its founder. The picture showed a bearded, bespectacled young man with a Kalashnikov over his shoulder. He was dressed for cold weather, as if in preparation for a night raid or patrol. When I saw him, I wondered when I had last seen someone looking so content.

As for the biography itself, nearly every word showed signs of careful selection, including his name, Bahrumi, a portmanteau of the Arabic words bahr (“sea”) and rumi (“Roman”). Many jihadists construct a nom de guerre from their first name and their national origin. He called himself Yahya of the Roman Sea, or Yahya the Mediterranean.

The biography continued:

His roots are from the island of Crete in the Roman sea (Bahr al-Rūm). Born in 1404 [a.d. 1983–84] and raised as a Nazarene [Christian], Yahya then entered Islam in 1422 [a.d. 2001–02]. He traveled seeking knowledge and work in the path of Allah until Allah granted him hijrah [migration] to Sham. He now resides in the countryside of Aleppo.

Now I thought I had enough data to narrow down his identity: a philologically inclined Cretan jihadist convert not just to Islam but to Dhahirism, a minuscule legal school. The list of candidates could not be long.

Many converts choose Arabic names that are the equivalent of their birth names. Yahya is Arabic for John, in English, or Ioannis in Greek, so I began searching online for Dhahiris with these names. In a German-language jihadist chat room, I found a reference to “Ioannis Georgilakis,” and here the trail began to sizzle under my feet. Georgilakis’s Facebook page showed photos of the same hirsute young man with glasses, dressed in Muslim garments and playing with his kids.

As I looked at his Facebook page, I began to wonder whether the Greek was an affectation. Many of his Facebook friends were English speakers, and few were Greek. Georgilakis isn’t an especially common surname, and given Yahya’s apparent creativity in self-naming, I tried a few permutations, including the English John and the vanilla, non-Cretan Greek version of Georgilakis, which would be Georgelas.

One of the first hits on Google for John Georgelas was an August 15, 2006, press release from the Department of Justice. “Supporter of Pro-Jihad Website Sentenced to 34 Months,” it crowed. At the time of his conviction, he lived in North Texas, near Plano, 20 minutes’ drive from the house where I grew up.

American muslims are rare in the Islamic State: Only 53 are publicly known to have traveled to Syria as jihadists, according to Seamus Hughes, the deputy director of George Washington University’s Program on Extremism. (The United States has stopped more than 100 others in the process of preparing to travel, or to act on behalf of the Islamic State in America.)

Hughes, a former Senate staffer, has meticulously cataloged the Americans who have made it to Syria, and places nearly all of them in the category of “knuckleheads”—brawny idiots with little hope of understanding a discussion of Islamic theology. Many have by now fulfilled their dream of battlefield death; all that remains of them is a martyrdom notice, posted like a headstone, on their Facebook page.

However canny the Islamic State’s internet-based recruiting, a personal touch remains crucial to fully radicalizing most targets and signing up new terrorists. In the United Kingdom, more than 100 fighters have waged jihad after contact with a group called Al Muhajiroun; in Belgium, Sharia4Belgium has recruited numerous Islamic State fighters. But in the United States, groups like these exist only in the fever dreams of Islamophobes.

Fewer than 20 percent of the Americans in the Islamic State are known to be converts to Islam, and many have long-standing family connections with other countries—long periods of residence in Kuwait, say, or ties to the Somali tribes of their parents. They do not, as a rule, ascend to high positions in the Islamic State’s organization. One Bosnian American, Abdullah Pazara, parlayed Serbian military training into command of an isis tank battalion. But even Pazara (who died in 2014) was relatively obscure and uncelebrated. In the United States, his most glorious achievement was owning a barely profitable trucking company.

Not all recruits are stupid. At least three have a college education and, according to friends and family, good academic records and habits. The smart ones, though, have in effect renounced their learning in favor of the greater glory of jihad. Having made it onto the dean’s list for a degree in computer science counts neither for nor against you if your goal is to explode in a crowd of apostates.

Yahya, it seemed to me, was unique. He in some ways resembled his fellow Americans in Syria: He went to fight, and he would have welcomed a battlefield death if God had willed it. But he was no mere foot soldier; his religious scholarship, connections, and standing distinguished him—even if I didn’t then understand their full extent. I wanted to know more.

Plano is a short drive from downtown Dallas, toward the Oklahoma border, a flatland sprouting subdivisions watered by money from the region’s burgeoning tech sector. Shortly after his probation expired, John Georgelas had posted a résumé online listing as his address an elegant brick house with white Doric columns, a small portico, and a circular driveway. In August 2015, when I first drove up, I could hear the happiness of children. I saw a boy, who looked about 10, bouncing a basketball in the driveway and two others playing nearby; they were about the same ages as the kids in the Facebook photos. As I approached the front door, I spied a yellow-ribbon decal (“We support our troops”) in the window, and behind it a foyer, tidy and richly decorated, and a piano festooned with family photos.

The man who answered the door was Timothy Georgelas, John’s father and the owner (with his wife, John’s mother, Martha) of the house. Both parents are Americans of Greek ancestry.Tim is a West Point graduate and a physician. He has a full head of gray hair and soft features that betray no sign of the stress of having raised an Islamic State terrorist. He has, however, no illusions about the life his son has chosen. “He and John are enemies,” I was told by someone who knows them both—“until the Day of Judgment.” Tim wore shorts and a T-shirt, and a crisp draft of air conditioning escaped as he said good morning. When I told him I had come to ask about John, he stepped outside and shut the door as if to seal off the house from his son’s name. He slumped in a white wicker chair by the front door, and with a reluctant gesture, he invited me to sit across from him. He stared at the magnolia tree in the front yard and said nothing. I told him what I knew—that his son, John, was Yahya. Tim sat, lips pursed, and with a shake of his head began to speak. “Every step of his life he’s made the wrong decisions, from high school onward,” Tim told me. “It is beyond me to understand why he threw what he had away.” Two of Yahya’s sisters have earned advanced degrees, he added, as if to demonstrate that it wasn’t failed parenting that led his only son to drop out of school, wage holy war, and plot mass murder.

“He was always the youngest kid in the class, and always a follower,” Tim said. “I have bailed him out so many times—financially, in circumstances with his wife and kids, you name it. I always pick up the wreckage.” The Yahya Tim described to me was a sad figure, a sheep who had strayed into a wicked flock. Above all, he was easily manipulated. This, for me, was another puzzle. The Yahya I had encountered online, and the one Musa Cerantonio described, was nothing like a sheep, and no pathetic follower. He was not the boy his father described. At some point, Yahya had shape-shifted into a wolf, into a leader of men. In december 1983, John Thomas Georgelas was born into a wealthy family with a long military tradition. His grandfather Colonel John Georgelas was wounded twice in the Second World War and worked for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Tim Georgelas spent three years in the U.S. Army, then accepted an Air Force commission to attend medical school. He retired as a colonel in 2001, and now practices radiology in a north-Dallas breast-imaging clinic. He is politically conservative, as is Martha, his short, dark-haired wife, whose Facebook cover photo shows her standing proudly in front of the George W. Bush Presidential Center, near downtown Dallas. The Georgelases moved frequently during John’s youth, as Tim’s military assignments required. John entered school at the age of 4, while the family was living in England, and he was young and small for his class. He was sickly—he grew benign tumors and had brittle bones—and his infirmities may have pushed him toward religion. When he was 11, his leg shattered, and he spent a long period out of school, recuperating. Lonely and depressed, his mind turned to God in idle moments, and he became attached to the Greek Orthodox Church. Wheelchair-bound, he hounded his family into attending services more regularly. Among his spiritual mentors was a clergyman who encouraged John to hate and distrust Muslims, with an intensity that would later change its polarity. (A family member calls John’s attitude one of “righteous fury, jacked up with certainty”—a bright-burning sanctimony that has been consistent across his religious transformations.) As the family’s male heir, John enjoyed a special status in the Georgelas patriarchy. With that status came expectations, and therefore disappointment when it became clear he was unsuited for a soldier’s life. His body refused to grow into robust, battle-ready form. Tim is tall, a former high-school quarterback, but John was shorter, his torso tending to pudge. His temperament wasn’t suited to military discipline. When he returned to school after his leg injury, he had little interest in academic achievement or rule-following. His father tried repeatedly to correct his behavior and failed. (This account is drawn from sources close to John, including family members, co-workers, friends, and correctional officers.) When John uttered the Muslim declaration of faith, the ashes of the World Trade Center were barely cool. Nor did he fit in well with his peers. He gravitated toward the skateboard set, and he didn’t date much, if at all. (One acquaintance told me, “If you put a million bucks on the table and told him to use it to go get laid, he couldn’t do it to save his life.”) Like many a military brat before him, John experimented with the counterculture. He smoked pot, dropped acid, and ate magic mushrooms. He hated his father for punishing his drug use and hated the U.S. government for criminalizing it. By the time he graduated from high school, his primary interests were computer hacking, skateboarding, and the voracious consumption of psychedelics. His grades were miserable, Tim says, but his standardized-test scores were better than those of his high-achieving sisters. John ended up studying philosophy at the College Station branch of Blinn College, an open-admission junior college in central Texas. He passed only a few classes. In a class on world religions at Blinn, the instructor’s cursory lecture on Islam annoyed him, so John sought more information from local Muslims. Curiosity turned to something more, as he discovered that Muslims were not the demons he had been led to expect them to be. A few days before Thanksgiving 2001, on the first day of Ramadan, John converted at a mosque in College Station frequented by foreign students from Texas A&M. Whether the conversion was meant to spite his parents or whether spite was just an ancillary benefit of his spiritual salvation, it is not possible to say. But the timing is suggestive. When John uttered the Muslim declaration of faith, the ashes of the World Trade Center were barely cool. Anti-Muslim sentiment in America was reaching new highs, and in central Texas, conversion to Islam would have been a singular act of rebellion. John’s parents found his conversion to be a sign of mental weakness. “Every university town in this country has a mosque for one reason,” Tim told me. “Kids are away from home for the first time, vulnerable and subject to influence. They hear the message and they’re hooked, and that’s what happened to John.” John took the name Yahya, and sold his pickup truck to buy a plane ticket. In December 2001, the family received an email from Yahya announcing that he was in Damascus learning Arabic. Western jihadists find their way to violence many different ways, but they often match a profile. And that profile fit John like a wet suit. He came from an upper-middle-class family. He squandered opportunities commensurate with his innate talent; he recognized that he would not excel in the fields chosen or glorified by his parents and authority figures. Often, a personal crisis—a death in the family, a near-death experience of one’s own—triggers existential contemplation, leading to religious exploration; in John’s case, his childhood frailty might have filled that role. Jihadists are also overwhelmingly left-brained, quantitative-analytic types. Diego Gambetta of the European University Institute and Steffen Hertog of the London School of Economics have noted a preponderance of former engineering students among jihadists; they suggest that the mental style of that discipline disposes certain people toward jihadism. As a teen, John had taught himself to program. His computers ran the Linux operating system, not the Windows or Mac software favored by the masses. Years later, after he had become a full-blown jihadist, he would share a line of C++ code on his website, a geeky statement of his own hard-line stance: if (1+1+1 != 1 && 1 == 1) return true; else die(); Translation: If you believe the Christian Trinity (“1+1+1”) is not really monotheistic (“!= 1”), and if you believe in the unity of God (“1 == 1”), then great. Otherwise: Die. Despite these binary inclinations, upon his arrival in Damascus Yahya envisioned himself as a Sufi, a Muslim mystic who sought oneness with God through poetry, perhaps, or dance or song, and who could countenance a shaded, or nuanced, version of Islam. That posture may have been a holdover from his counterculture teens. Gradually, though, under the influence of British Muslims who were more rigid in their approach to the faith, he became jihad-curious. They persuaded him to follow a bin-Ladenist approach, hostile to Sufism, instead. Yahya soon surpassed them in intolerance. To his jihadism he added general displeasure with the hierarchy of scholarly authority in mainstream religion. He objected to mainstream imams’ telling him to trust the words of scholars and not to attempt his own interpretation of scripture and law. Muslim laymen are generally advised not to derive legal rulings on their own, and to follow more-experienced scholars. But Yahya maintained a typically American can-do attitude toward his religion, similar to the one many Texans adopt toward their trucks: If he couldn’t understand or fix it himself, it didn’t feel like his. He acquired The Hans Wehr Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic, a cuboid volume that is the standard Arabic-English reference work. It is not meant to be read through. The typical student of Arabic keeps the Hans Wehr on a corner of his desk and consults it as needed for the rest of his natural life. Yahya memorized it in six months. Then, as a chaser, he memorized Kitab al-Ayn, the eighth-century Arabic dictionary by al-Khalil al-Farahidi. He wandered through Damascus, chatting up everyone and learning classical Arabic to a level of proficiency rarely achieved even by educated native Arabic speakers. He drifted further from his parents and sisters. Later, when counseling other Muslims about how much effort to put into proselytization at home versus heading directly to the Islamic State, Yahya wrote: What about those [Muslims] who are trying to work on their families, but their families insist on kufr [disbelief in Islam]? Should they wait their whole lives in patience, trying to guide someone whom Allah has not chosen for guidance, or should they move on and help their true family: the Muslims? Yahya met his wife in 2003 on a Muslim matrimonial site. Tania was born in London in 1983 to Bengali British parents. It was almost as if they had shared the same life, before even being introduced. Like Yahya, Tania grew up riddled with benign tumors and incorrigibly rebellious. She tormented her parents by practicing, with alarming vigor, the religion they had neglected in the pursuit of an assimilated English middle-class existence. She was a pretty girl, a petite firecracker. But her mischief was not of the usual variety, like dating boys her parents didn’t approve of. When her parents suggested that she try to meet boys, Tania hissed “Muslims don’t date.” She had a type: Her heartthrob was John Walker Lindh, the American who fought for the Taliban in 2001. She swore that until marriage no strange man would know anything more of her physical appearance than its cloaked outline, and by her late teens she was draping herself in a full-body covering, or jilbab. She fantasized about packing a bomb under it. At 19, she married Yahya. Yahya and Tania lied to anyone who inquired about their activities. When Syrian government spies started asking neighbors about them, they moved on. After meeting online, Yahya and Tania fell in love fast, and just as couples bond over Netflix or jogging or cooking, they bonded over jihad and a shared capacity for bad decisions. After a month of digital flirtation, Yahya flew to London, and they met in person on March 15, 2003. Within three days they married secretly, then left for Texas. They settled in College Station and partook of the pleasures of freedom, young love, and independence from family. They lived cheaply and happily, embracing as their community the foreign students at the mosque where Yahya had converted. The mosque threw them a wedding party, and rich Gulf Arabs who lived near the university kicked in money to support Yahya’s continued study of Islam. The couple indulged, too, in their other shared passion: getting high. Islamic orthodoxy considers cannabis an intoxicant, and therefore forbidden. But Yahya’s practice of Islam was unconventional even then. In a historical essay titled “Cannabis,” heavily footnoted with classical Arabic sources, he made the Islamic case for pot. There was evidence, he wrote, that early Islamic leaders had taxed hemp seeds. Since Muslims generally cannot tax forbidden substances, such as pork or alcohol, Yahya reasoned, they must have considered pot permissible. As for psilocybin: Yahya cited an obscure hadith (a report of the sayings and actions of Muhammad) that he said described Muhammad’s having descended from a mountain after meditation and extolling the medicinal properties of mushrooms—particularly as a cure for diseases of the eye. Yahya and Tania took this to mean that God had sanctioned the ingestion of psychedelic mushrooms. So the young lovers blissed out under the Texas sky, shrooming after the example of the prophet himself. In late 2003, Yahya and Tania traveled to Damascus for an extended honeymoon, living there furtively and quietly associating with other jihadists. Their existence mirrored that of many young radical tumbleweeds of yesteryear: Black Panthers, Baader-Meinhof gangsters, fin de siècle anarchists. They dodged the authorities and lied to anyone who inquired about their activities. When Syrian government spies started asking neighbors about them, they moved on, settling briefly in a town selected because it was prophesied to be the headquarters of the prophet Jesus upon his return. They often quarreled. Still strong-willed, Tania wanted to obey only God. But God’s words were unequivocal: “Men are in charge over women,” says a Koranic verse. So for most of the 10 years before the founding of the Islamic State, Yahya maintained a Rasputinlike control over her. He hadn’t had much success finding social esteem in his prior life, but in Tania he found his first student. He mesmerized her with his confidence, and she repressed her own misgivings whenever she found herself questioning him. Tania has mild dyslexia; Yahya’s reading of Islamic texts convinced her, with his fluency and recall and breadth, that he could produce an unanswerable argument about any point on which she disagreed. She determined that Yahya was a genius with gifts God had denied her, and she accepted her place in the world of jihad: Service to Yahya was her ticket to heaven. She endorsed slavery, apocalypse, polygamy, and killing. She aspired to raise seven boys as holy warriors—one to conquer each continent. From Syria they returned to London, where Yahya chose to follow a Jordanian known as Abu Issa. He had allegedly fought the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s, and on April 3, 1993, his followers there swore loyalty to him and created what the French scholar Kévin Jackson calls “the forgotten caliphate,” an unsuccessful precursor of the Islamic State. Abu Issa declared himself caliph and ruled a small portion of Afghanistan’s Kunar province in the mid-to-late 1990s. There he implemented many practices that the Islamic State would later realize on a larger scale. The total area governed did not extend beyond a few small towns, and the local Afghans despised Abu Issa and his supporters. When Osama bin Laden came to Afghanistan in 1996, Abu Issa sent a message demanding his obedience. (There is no record of a reply.) In the late 1990s, when the Taliban took over Kunar province, Abu Issa and his followers relocated to London, and it was in that diminished state that Yahya and Tania first encountered them. For a while, Yahya had the jihadist-dork dream job of tutoring the caliph’s son in the subjects of computer hacking and martial arts. Ultimately Yahya and Abu Issa fell out over a dispute regarding interpretation of Islamic law. But during that period, Yahya nurtured an interest in the obligation to declare a caliphate and in Islamic literalism, both of which would drive him, in the end, back to Syria. At a bookshop in London, he found a copy of the works of Ibn Hazm (994–1064), by far the greatest Dhahiri scholar. Dhahirism is the most binary and monochrome of Islamic legal schools. In some ways, it resembles the constitutional originalism of Clarence Thomas or Antonin Scalia: It drastically and pitilessly winnows down the sources of legal authority to the Koran, the sayings and actions of Muhammad, and the ironclad consensus of the prophet’s followers within his own lifetime. It refuses to accept new laws based on analogy to old ones, and it urges jurists and theologians to resist allegorical or figurative readings, and instead stick to rulings with plain textual support.The rejection of figurative readings, legal analogy, and other types of extended interpretation strikes most mainstream Muslim scholars as preposterous. But through Dhahiri eyes, scripture should simply be read like a manual—or like software. It is a legal and theological methodology that aligned well with Yahya’s left-brained, autodidactic disposition. In september 2004, Yahya and Tania returned to the United States, relying financially on Yahya’s parents. They settled briefly in Torrance, California, with Yahya hoping to find work as an imam. His jihadism disqualified him for mosque jobs, however, and increasingly the two sought only each other’s spiritual camaraderie. They stopped frequenting mosques altogether, on the grounds that they were dens of spies. When a SWAT team came to their house in Grapevine, Texas, early in the morning, Yahya and Tania were already awake for dawn prayers. In 2004, their first son was born in California. Yahya and Tania moved back to greater Dallas, and a year later, Yahya took a job as a data technician at Rackspace, a server company in Texas. At night, he cruised jihadist forums and offered tech support to Jihad Unspun, a Canada-based Islamist news site widely thought to be a recruiting ground for would-be terrorists. He also looked for ways to use his position at Rackspace to wage jihad. On April 8, 2006, he accessed the passwords of a client, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, with the intention of hijacking its website. As hacking jobs go, it was amateurish. Rackspace found out, and the FBI, aware of Yahya’s terror links, moved fast. When a swat team came to his house in Grapevine, Texas, early in the morning, he and Tania were already awake for dawn prayers. He surrendered peacefully and warned that a child was sleeping inside and that his wife needed to get dressed. The Department of Justice prosecuted him for hacking into a protected computer—this was the source of the press release I had found earlier—and a judge sentenced him to 34 months’ imprisonment. Prior to his arrest, he had planned to travel to Iraq to fight against the Americans, so prison may have saved his life. Yahya’s arrest caused marital friction of a new sort. With her husband in prison and studying Islamic texts full-time, Tania began asserting her independence. After receiving scowls from neighbors due to her Muslim dress, she told Yahya she planned to wear just a veil, and not a full-body cloak. Yahya, furious, demanded that she cover herself fully when she visited him in prison, to be sure no one would titter at the immodesty of the sheikh’s wife. (He had Muslim acquaintances in prison and was the most scholarly among them.) He told her to leave infidel America to join the group known as the Nigerian Taliban, a predecessor to Boko Haram. She refused and threatened divorce. But she didn’t leave him—even after he got out of prison and took a second wife, a Jamaican British friend of Tania’s. Tania did not approve, but she didn’t forbid the union. The bride still lived in London, and the groom could not travel without violating parole. Yahya investigated the Islamic legality of a marriage conducted across physical distance. He found precedent: Muhammad had married the widow of his brother-in-law when she was in Ethiopia and he was in Medina. Having ascertained the validity of marriage-by-telecom, Yahya and his second wife married over the phone, with Tania present and quietly fuming. (Yahya later divorced his second wife.) About his crimes, he remained unrepentant. “He can justify anything he does, and he didn’t think he did anything wrong,” Tim says. “He is just full of himself.” During his parole, Yahya lived in Dallas and worked as an IT specialist for a shoe wholesaler. In August 2009, 10 months after he’d left prison, a second child arrived, another boy. The extended Georgelas family took a trip to Hawaii, and the couple came along. Tania stayed secluded, says one acquaintance, and Yahya harangued everyone about the virtues of Sharia law. But he mostly stayed quiet during that period. The family wondered whether he had mellowed, though Yahya’s colleagues at the shoe company report that he and Tania occasionally posted politically worrisome items on Facebook. On october 1, 2011, Yahya’s parole expired, and he drove to the Dallas–Fort Worth airport with his wife and two children, a free man. He was leaving America—probably for good. “Muslims in America,” he wrote around that time, “remember: Hijrah is always an option and sometimes an obligation.” The family flew to London, then Cairo. Yahya and Tania lived in Egypt for the next two years, at first happily: The boys were clever and precocious—YouTube videos show the younger one reading words in English, French, and Arabic before the age of 3—and they were joined on Christmas Day 2011 by another boy. The family sailed feluccas on the Nile and savored life beyond the reach of the U.S. government. Yahya earned money by translating fatwas from the salaried religious scholars of the government of Qatar. Ever allergic to human authority, he seethed at the banality of the fatwas and the government clerics’ abject servitude to tyrants. None of the fatwas ever mentioned what he considered the core imperatives of Islam, stressed by Ibn Hazm a thousand years before, such as the establishment of a caliphate and emigration from lands of disbelief. The scholars relentlessly glorified the Qatari royal family. The fatwas, Yahya claimed, were based not on evidence but on mere opinion. In Cairo, Yahya met other jihadists and became respected for his scholarly rigor. One person who knew him then describes him as one of the strongest pre- isis pro-caliphate voices, and says the online seminars he conducted in Arabic and English did much to “prepare” Westerners for the declaration of the caliphate that would come a few years later. Musa Cerantonio, who would become his leading Australian disciple, met him digitally. European jihadists began traveling to Egypt to learn from him. He impressed one sheikh so much that the man declared that it would be sinful for Yahya to expose himself to danger on the battlefield in a conflict like Afghanistan’s or Syria’s. “Your blood is haram,” he said—forbidden to spill.In his sermons and public statements, Yahya anticipated many of the themes of Islamic State propaganda, including distrust of Islamist movements that compromised their religion by partaking in secular politics. On social media, Tania supported his views, but with each child she bore, her eagerness to join the jihad by then under way in Syria waned. Yahya reminded her that the Koran judges harshly those who give up on hijrah: Angels will rip their souls from their mortal bodies and prepare them for judgment by God. “The angels will say, ‘Was not God’s earth spacious [enough] for you to emigrate in it?’ For those, their refuge is Hell.” In July 2013, a secular military coup toppled the Muslim Brotherhood–led government in Egypt, and the Islamist moment there passed as quickly as it had arrived. Yahya and Tania fretted about the possible consequences for them as jihadists, and sought escape. Cerantonio encouraged them to consider the southern Philippines, where he was living at the time. It turned out to be too rustic. “Look, I’m happy to be in, like, a mud hut,” Yahya said to him. “But my wife is very specific and is asking you to take photos of houses.” The houses were inadequate, so they scrapped that plan. Ultimately, the Syrian civil war presented opportunities that Yahya couldn’t decline. His poetry frequently had a martial tone: Rise, cut ties: spies disguised in white,

by the sword, for the Lord of Might

Defeat the cheat, trite fleet of fright,

by rod—by God!—by baud, by byte. For years before the Islamic State’s rise, Yahya had said his weapon of choice was the keyboard (“by baud, by byte”). But now that Syria was becoming the battlefield he had dreamed of, he was ready to take up other arms. When they left Cairo, Yahya insisted on going to Turkey. Once there, in August 2013, he took his family onto a bus and told them they were going on a trip. He did not reveal their destination until Tania (now almost five months pregnant with their fourth child) saw the Syrian border. By then, the Assad government had lost control of large parts of northern Syria, and around Aleppo, factions were working with and against one another. The region had become an anarchic wasteland haunted by death. They squatted in a villa, the abandoned residence of a Syrian general, in the town of Azaz, a few miles inside the border. The windows had been smashed and the plumbing shut off, but the chandeliers were still hanging. Mujahideen groups controlled the territory, and Yahya’s connections assured his family a meager supply of food. He spent days with jihadist friends. He had known some of them only in an online fantasy life; now they were comrades in arms. Tania and the children got sick and developed mysterious infections. She prepared herself for the possibility that government forces or other rebels would overrun their position. But she also still loved the rush, and was curious about the fighting nearby. She wanted to see the action, but because she was a woman, when she poked her head out the window, she was told to be sensible and get back inside. When she complained to Yahya about being brought into a war zone without consultation—“How could you do this to us?”—he cited a hadith: “War,” he said, “is deception.” She finally decided: Ten years of this was enough. She demanded to take the kids back to Turkey. Yahya could not or would not join them. He had come to fight for isis, and he knew the penalty in the afterlife for retreating from the battlefield. But his kids were not mujahideen, so he let them go—across a minefield, through sniper fire, back into Turkey—with the assumption that the family would reunite, in this world or the next. Tania made reverse hijrah to Plano, moved into Tim and Martha’s house, and gave birth to a boy, her fourth, in January 2014. In December 2014, she petitioned for divorce. Her own transformation has been bittersweet. These days she describes herself as “agnostic,” and has said, in her discussions with friends online, that she is “a lost cause to Muslims now.” In her social-media postings, she looks like any other painted-lady infidel of north Dallas. She dresses stylishly, baring a shoulder now and then, and has highlights in her dark hair. Still in her early 30s, she looks free, even reborn. “Some people would make takfir of me”—excommunicate her—“for this,” she writes. “But I have hope in God that he understands my weaknesses.” Many would call Yahya’s treatment of Tania unforgivable and urge her to forget him. But the two have shared most of their adult lives, in difficult and thrilling circumstances. She has left jihadism, but she cannot completely leave Yahya. On social media, she wrote to a relative of her husband’s: Where do I begin discussing the ‘Ioannis complex’? … He’s a man torn between two worlds, well actually four or more in his case (East vs. West, religious principles vs. family and happiness) … We made some really poor choices that backfired on us … Ioannis is fixated on changing the hearts and minds of people and the course of history. I’m somewhat jealous of the love and devotion he has for Islam over me. That devotion has not wavered. After he turned away from his wife and children that day in 2013, Yahya added a new and unlikely chapter to the Georgelas military tradition. For several months, he trained as a soldier as part of an Islamic State–aligned group near Aleppo. He saw battle there, and during combat in April 2014, a mortar blast sent shrapnel into his back, nearly severing his spine. “I was in immense pain,” he wrote on his website, “but I at least knew that my reward is with Allah and that comforted me greatly.” He spent time in a hospital in Turkey. Then, fearing detection as an American (he could pass as Syrian, but not indefinitely), he went back to Syria and received treatment from Adam Brookman, an Australian alleged jihadist who has since returned to Australia and is under arrest (Brookman, a nurse, maintains that he went to Syria solely for humanitarian reasons). Yahya posted images on Facebook of his suppurating wounds and of himself on bed rest, smiling. The scars are, for him as for other jihadists, a VIP pass in the afterlife, a badge of honor that shows his commitment to God during his time on Earth. His injuries left him temporarily unable to walk—disabled again, 20 years after his first leg injury. But he was content and proud. A fellow jihadist posted a photograph of a grinning, bespectacled Yahya on Facebook, with the caption “American muhajir injured in reef halab [the outskirts of Aleppo] by mortar shrapnel Alhamdulillah improving and cant wait to get back on his feet.” During that period he took up with a new wife, a Syrian, and had a daughter with her about a year after Tania’s departure, and another some time later. Throughout his convalescence, he continued to tweet and write aggressively in favor of isis, though he was not yet in isis territory. His website, still obscure, attracted more followers, though it remained a highbrow product, too scholarly for the masses. It was around this time that he began pestering isis’s leaders—particularly Adnani—to declare a caliphate. When the declaration happened, in June 2014, Yahya was living near Aleppo, about 100 miles from Raqqah, the Islamic State’s capital. “This is the moment I have been waiting [for] for years,” he wrote. He immediately committed to moving to Raqqah. His plans were thwarted for a time after the Free Syrian Army captured him. He was eventually released, and silently vowed to return to behead his captors. For a brief while he feigned cooperation with the group. But in mid-2015, he made his way to the caliphate’s capital. His shattered back would have earned him exemption from frontline military duty—but isis’s leadership by then recognized that his talents were best put to use not as a grunt but as a scholar and spokesman. On December 8, 2015, Yahya’s voice came through clearly on Al Bayan radio—the voice of the Islamic State. He is now the Islamic State’s leading producer of high-end English-language propaganda as a prolific writer for its flagship magazines, Dabiq and Rumiyah. For a while, he tweeted under pseudonyms, but in keeping with a general Islamic State move toward other, better-encrypted media, he stopped and now appears to be limited to official channels. The profile photo for one of his last personal Twitter accounts is a well-worn laptop with a Browning 9 mm semiautomatic handgun resting across the keyboard. Yahya is the Islamic State’s leading producer of high-end English-language propaganda. Recently, clues have emerged that he may be much more. The first article in Dabiq that I have been able to confirm was written by Yahya was published in April 2016, and took as its subject Western Muslims who, despite calling themselves Muslims, are infidels. The headline, “Kill the Imams of Kufr [Disbelief] in the West,” was only marginally less grotesque than the accompanying design: crosshairs over images of prominent mainstream Western Muslims; an image of a crouching, blindfolded “apostate” at the moment an executioner’s blade enters his neck. In the article, Yahya recounted many stories of Muhammad and his companions’ harsh treatment of Muslims who had lapsed. Hands and feet are severed, eyes gouged out with nails, bodies stomped to death. The issue that followed bore Yahya’s fingerprints everywhere. A polemical article about Christianity notes, with a familiar pedantry and some of Yahya’s favorite Bible verses, inconsistencies between Christian doctrine and the historical record. Some articles are clearly his, and others, whether his or not, use the voice he has perfected. Unsigned, but likely written by Yahya, is the pellucid “Why We Hate You & Why We Fight You,” which avows the religious nature of the war. “We hate you, first and foremost, because you are disbelievers,” it begins. The article reads like a distillation of every conversation I have ever had with a jihadist: The fact is, even if you were to stop bombing us, imprisoning us, torturing us, vilifying us, and usurping our lands, we would continue to hate you because our primary reason for hating you will not cease to exist until you embrace Islam … What’s equally if not more important to understand is that we fight you, not simply to punish and deter you, but to bring you true freedom in this life and salvation in the Hereafter, freedom from being enslaved to your whims and desires as well as those of your clergy and legislatures, and salvation by worshipping your Creator alone and following His messenger. The Islamic State has staked its survival on creating a revolutionary Muslim mass movement—one that can compensate for its loss of territory in Iraq and Syria by rising up elsewhere. With Yahya it lends an American accent to its universal jihadist message, and a speaker whose strengths, weaknesses, personality, and insecurities are deeply American as well. He knows how to speak to Americans, how to scare them, how to recruit them—how to make the Islamic State’s war theirs. It is unknown how far Yahya’s role extends beyond keyboard jihad. But clues have very recently emerged that point toward an extraordinary possibility. In August, a drone killed Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, the Islamic State’s most powerful leader save for Baghdadi himself, and—according to Musa Cerantonio—Yahya’s friend and patron. Adnani is widely suspected of having directed foreign terrorist attacks on behalf of the Islamic State, including the mass murder of restaurant- and concertgoers in Paris in November 2015. The suspected operational mastermind of that attack, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, was emir of the foreign fighters in Azaz around the time of Yahya’s residence there. Adnani himself was from the town of Binnish, also in northwestern Syria. Adnani’s death left a job opening, and on December 5, 2016, the Islamic State announced the name of his successor: Abu al‑Hassan al-Muhajir. That name is nearly identical to an active alias of John Georgelas, Abu Hassān al-Muhajir. (A muhajir is someone who has immigrated to the Islamic State, a foreign fighter rather than a Syrian or an Iraqi.) The title inherited by “Abu al-Hassan” is mutahaddith, or “spokesman.” The job may or may not include Adnani’s responsibility for directing overseas attacks. It certainly means that the Islamic State—in all its official pronouncements, its incitements to terror, its encouragements of its supporters—will speak in Abu al-Hassan’s words. The voice that delivered the December 5 speech was not Yahya’s. But the Islamic State has altered voices in the past, to protect the identities of key figures—and however fluent Yahya’s Arabic is, it might have preferred a native speaker to deliver a prepared text under his name. “Al-Muhajir” is an epithet shared by a significant percentage of foreign fighters (though most go by a more specific origin-name, such as “the Belgian” or “the Tunisian”), and many jihadists would have a firstborn son named Hassan; it is a relatively common name. The Islamic State likely includes more than one person with the name Abu al-Hassan al-Muhajir, although I can find no record of anyone in the Islamic State using that name or Yahya’s variant before December 5, other than Yahya himself. For Yahya to occupy such a celebrated position would mean an improbable ascent through an organization dominated by Syrians and Iraqis. To succeed Adnani directly would mean leapfrogging numerous other candidates with greater seniority and previous authority in the group. No analyst with whom I have spoken thinks it likely that an American could rise so high in the group. But no other American is quite like Yahya, and until now, few people outside jihadist circles and the American intelligence community have even known of his existence. “We’ve become numb to what he’s doing,” Tim told me when I first met him. He says they haven’t heard anything from Yahya since 2014, and they hadn’t heard confirmation that he was with the Islamic State until I appeared on their doorstep. “He’s no one I recognize anymore. I’m not looking out for what he’s doing, or how he’s doing, because I’m not sure it makes any difference.” Martha, he said, has taken longer to come to terms with the loss of their son. They don’t think he will return to America—not as long as he has a following in Raqqah, and the certainty of incarceration in the United States. Tania and the kids lived with them for a long period after her return, but she now resides separately. The kids stay with their grandparents during the week and their mother on weekends. Having spent most of the past decade as an itinerant jihadist, Tania lacks the job skills and degrees to match her intellect, so she does not have the resources or career prospects to raise four young children on her own. The kids will grow up in Plano, their safety and education financed by their father’s abandoned inheritance. The Islamic State’s enemies are drawing closer to Yahya, from all sides and from above. Drones assassinate his brethren every few days, and there is reason to believe they will kill him too if they get the chance. The U.S. government’s “kill list,” which once included the Yemeni American jihadist Anwar al-Aulaqi, likely now includes John Thomas Georgelas, if his name hasn’t been crossed off already by the time this article reaches readers. Whatever parenting flaws Tim may have had could not possibly merit the anguish he and his wife have suffered. He still seems to think of his son as “John,” a wayward kid, easily influenced by his more assertive elders. “This is the first time in his life where he’s in a position where he might be emulated,” Tim told me. I wanted to tell Tim and Martha that Yahya had been emulated for years, and their inability to see jihadism as a valid subject of intellectual expertise had kept them from realizing it. They didn’t know how evil their son had become, or how coolly competent. Like other parents of jihadists, they saw him as they wished to see him—as the youngster who bumbled through classes, sneaked spliffs, and struggled to hold down jobs. There was comfort in imagining that he remained hapless, and perhaps that his Islam was just another phase. They would be more troubled by the truth—which was that their son, a failure in so many prior pursuits, had found his calling.

Skies over Moscow turn red as Russia concludes 72nd Victory Day celebration with a massive fireworks display to mark the defeat of Hitler

Huge Victory Day military parade in Moscow involves 10,000 troops and more than 100 units of equipment

Russian President Vladimir Putin was in attendance as well as former Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev

The annual Red Square march in Moscow marks the defeat of Hitler’s Nazi Germany in the Second World War

previously predicted rain halted by ‘spiking clouds’ with chemicals to stop rain.

Thousands of Muscovites stood outside last night to witness a massive fireworks display to commemorate the 72nd anniversary of the defeat of Nazism.

Earlier in the day, Vladimir Putin warned the world his Russian army can ‘repel any potential aggression’ after 10,000 troops marched through Red Square with a terrifying arsenal of missiles in a military parade.

The annual march in Moscow marks the defeat of Hitler in the Second World War, but the Russian president was using it today to showcase the Kremlin’s modern military might.

Putin was personally taking the salute at the parade involving 10,000 troops and 114 units of military equipment.

As the sun descended over Moscow, locals were treated to a spectacular fireworks and pyrotechnic display

The spectacular fireworks display was to mark the 72nd anniversary of Victory of Nazi Germany in the Great Patriotic War

The skies above Moscow where lit up with the massive fireworks display celebrating the end of the Second World War

+89 The Russian Air Force had to cancel plans to fly 72 aircraft over Moscow were cancelled due a low cloud base

+89 Putin ordered his military to spike the clouds above Moscow with chemicals to make them disappear but the plan failed

The parade gave the first public showing of Tor and Pantsir mobile surface-to-air missile that have been adapted for use in Russia’s Arctic forces, their white-and-black winter camouflage standing out amid the olive drab of other war machines.

‘The armed forces of Russia are capable of repelling any potential aggression,’ Putin told thousands of military personnel.

Plans to send 72 aircraft overhead were defeated by the weather – despite the Kremlin spending £1.3 million to spike the clouds with a chemical cocktail to supposedly guarantee sunshine. Previously predicted rain was halted though, thanks to the weather changing technology.

The fly-past was grounded because of low cloud, thwarting Putin’s bid to showcase his air force and honour Russian pilots who have served in Syria.

The Soviet ‘weather changing’ technology successfully prevented rain on Putin’s parade but failed to disperse the thick low cloud so only a display of armoured vehicles and missile systems went ahead.

Putin told the annual commemoration: ‘We will always guard Russia just as you, the soldiers of the Victory, did.

‘And [we will] strengthen the traditions of patriotism, loyally serving the homeland.

‘The lessons of the past war force us to be vigilant and the Russian Armed Forces are ready to repel any potential attack.’

He vowed: ‘There was no, there is no and there will be no force that could ever enslave our people.

‘They fought to the bitter end, defending their homeland, and did what seemed impossible, they turned the bloody wheel of the Second World War back, drove the enemy from our land where it dared to come, crushed Nazism, put an end to its atrocities.

‘And we will never forget that it was our fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers who brought the freedom to Europe and the long-awaited peace on the planet.’

The Russian president personally took the salute at the parade. But a fly-past of 72 aircraft was cancelled.

This meant no display by Russia’s Sukhoi Su-30SM fighter jets, which have seen combat action recently in Syria.

A debut Victory Day march was scheduled for schoolchildren in Russia’s new ‘Yunarmia’, a 30,000-strong militarised patriotic movement nicknamed the Putin Youth Army and established by the Defence Ministry.

It was scheduled to begin at 10am in Moscow, 8am London time, with other commemorations held in cities across Russia’s 11 time zones.

On display in Moscow was the the newly developed Tor-M2DT short-range anti-aircraft missile system and the Pantsir-SA surface-to-air missile system, both designed to operate in the Arctic.

Russian air force Commander Col. Gen. Viktor Bondarev said: ‘What makes this year so special is that virtually each and every pilot who will take part in the 9 May flyby in Moscow has fought in Syria, is highly decorated, and will showcase skills that will make many countries salivate.’

This year marks the 72nd anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe.

The sombre occasion is a show of respect to the 27 million Soviet soldiers and civilians who died during the defeat of the Nazis.

Many Russians were today honouring the dead in their own families by taking part in marches to the Immortal Regiment, holding pictures of relatives who perished in the war.

Meanwhile, more than 10,000 people waving Russian flags and carrying portraits of Stalin watched tanks roll through Ukraine’s de facto rebel capital Donetsk on Tuesday in celebration of the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany.

The display of military might used by the Moscow-backed insurgents in their three-year conflict against government forces violated the terms of a long-ignored 2015 peace deal.

Donetsk straddles a demarcation line in the industrial east of Ukraine from which both sides’ big guns were meant to have been withdrawn almost two years ago.

An AFP reporter counted 45 pieces of heavy military equipment – ranging from a lone World War II-era tank to its modern versions used in the current war as well as rocket launchers and anti-aircraft guns – roll through the city’s main street.

Donetsk separatist leader Alexander Zakharchenko led a march of about 1,000 fighters who held up a long banner painted the black and orange colours of Russia’s patriotic Saint George’s ribbon.

Others in the parade carried portraits of warlords killed in Europe’s only war, in which more than 10,000 people have died.

Zakharchenko told the crowd that May 9 ‘is the holiest day for us all’.

On the other side of the frontline Ukrainian authorities have joined European nations in marking the end of World War II on May 8 after its 2014 pro-EU revolution. The decision was meant to underscore Ukraine’s split with Russia and embrace of the West.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko told a group of soldiers on Tuesday that ‘we will no longer celebrate this holiday along the Russian scenario.’

But several hundred people carrying photographs of relatives who fought in what the Soviet Union called ‘The Great Patriotic War’ still marched through Kiev on Tuesday.

These episodes have been filled with these crappy plot holes and now after Episode 2 of Season 7, I have to call out the show. It will be too bad if the ending of such a great show takes this course.

Last night’s episode was a good example of this. Take, for instance, the final scene of the episode. Dany has instructed Yara to take Ellaria and the Sand Snakes back to Dorne to muster an army. Immediately this is problematic to me.

Sunspear is located at the southern tip of Westeros. Dragonstone is much further north, and very close to King’s Landing. Let’s take a look at a map:

Map by sanjota on DeviantArt

See how Sunspear is located in a nice secure bay, far south of King’s Landing and Cersei’s armies? See how Dragonstone is basically just across the water from King’s Landing?

To get all the way to Dragonstone from Slaver’s Bay, Dany would have to sail right past the Dornish capital. It would be an easy stop along the way, and the perfect place to meet up with Dany’s allies.

So why on earth didn’t she stop there to discuss her plans for invading King’s Landing and taking the Seven Kingdoms? Why sail all the way to Dragonstone if her plan was to then have most of her force sail south again?

Olenna was already in Dorne, forming her own alliance between House Tyrell and the Martells (or, well, the Sands.) Dany could have stopped at Sunspear, well protected in the Sea of Dorne, where she could have conveyed plans for her allies to march against King’s Landing.

This way, Yara wouldn’t have had to take Ellaria back to Dorne. They’d be there already! Grey Worm wouldn’t have had to sail all the way to Dragonstone and then all the way back down and around to Casterly Rock, either. He could have just left from Sunspear! Even Olenna would have had an easier time returning to Highgarden to muster her armies. (Though she can teleport, so no biggie.)

…

From a narrative perspective, this is horribly contrived writing. There’s only one reason to do it: To place Yara and Ellaria in danger and have Euron capture them. That is literally the only reason, and it’s a very, very bad one.

What we’re seeing here is not a consequence of a character’s actions, but rather a consequence arranged by the writers to conveniently push the story in a direction they wanted it to go. There was no debate between Tyrion and Dany about stopping in Dorne. This isn’t the consequence of a stubborn Queen, foolishly demanding that her court is held in Dragonstone. It’s just…well, I’m sorry, but it’s just bad, sloppy writing. I’m very disappointed by it.

Actions have consequences in Martin’s books, and now more than ever I miss those books and wish (and pray to the Seven!) that he’d hurry up and finish The Winds of Winter already, so we could have his careful plotting and characterization back, as opposed to this rather hurried imitation.

I say this as a really big fan of the show. I often defend the changes the show makes from the books, and sometimes I think they can even be better (or at least better for a TV audience.) But this is not one of those times. Indeed, the way this was rushed and set up has me really worried that the rest of the show will take similarly predictable and contrived approaches.

Winterfell

Here’s another example. Sansa. Sansa was just reunited with her brother (“brother”) Jon Snow last season after escaping horrible abuse at the hands of Ramsay Bolton, who she was sold off to by Littlefinger. But instead of arresting Littlefinger, or sending him away, she publicly opposes Jon in court numerous times. In both the last two episodes she publicly disagrees with him in a way that just…it doesn’t make sense. This is the sort of thing Tywin Lannister would never allow. It’s not her place to question her brother, the King in the North, in front of all his assembled lords and ladies. These are the sorts of conversations that would take place in the war room, in relative privacy.

The show throws them in there, abundantly, to set up what I believe to be a really awful conflict between Sansa and Jon, with Littlefinger in there stirring the pot. It’s not that Sansa is even wrong, it’s that the show wants so badly to create more courtroom politics that they’re undermining how these characters would actually behave. I think Sansa would be so relieved to be safe for the first time in years, at home with Jon finally and out of the clutches of Ramsay and Joffrey, that she’d be less inclined to screw him over in front of his bannermen.

And make no mistake, that’s exactly what she’s doing. She’s undermining him left and right, when she’s the one person who should have his back more than anyone else. This all started with the Battle of the Bastards, when she didn’t tell him about the Knights of the Vale, and only brought them to bear when Jon was very nearly dead already.

I don’t like it, not because it’s two of the story’s “good guys” butting heads, but because there’s literally no reason for them to do so. Sansa isn’t stupid, but the show sure wants us to think she is for some reason.

Queen’s Landing

Or take Cersei’s new dragon-killing technology that’s…just a basic ballista. This would almost certainly already have been invented given how far along Westeros society is, with massive fortresses and presumably the siege technology to defend and attack them. Besides, it’s one thing to hit a dragon’s skull when the creature is dead, and quite another to aim a ballista at a moving, flying target. Good luck with that, Qyburn.

Then there’s Dany trying to cow Varys and threatening to burn him alive, and acting like a real tyrant by summoning Jon Snow to “bend the knee.” What on earth is the show trying to do with this character? I have no idea at this point. She’s utterly unlikable, a Mad Queen in the making, but still propped up as some wonderful savior. Varys and Tyrion and all her other sidekicks love her to pieces, but she’s acting like a villain. It doesn’t add up.

In Sum

I miss the books, where at least you could follow the logic behind every character’s decision, whether wise or foolish, wicked or noble. I miss the books where things didn’t just happen so that the plot would move forward. I miss the books where naval battles actually made sense. Last night’s we had Euron miraculously finding Yara’s fleet in the dark, in the middle of the night, then picking out her exact ship and boarding it. He’s also able to burn her entire fleet without her even attempting to run away, and without setting fire to his own ships. Right.

And before you show up in the comments talking about how there’s magical White Walkers and Dragons and this is a Fantasy so I should stop worrying about all this, no. No that’s just wrong. What made the books and the early seasons of this show so great was the fact that there’s an internal logic, an internal consistency that holds the world together. Human conflicts born out of human actions. Plausible characters making the best choices they could even when they were wrong. All the fantasy trappings add flavor without disrupting the realism of the story itself.

All the best fantasies do this. Tolkien isn’t “gritty” the same way that Martin is, but his characters still behave like real people. The human conflicts are still the most interesting. Boromir’s betrayal is still, in my mind, among the most powerful scenes in all fiction.

So I’m worried. The first episode of the season was great, but this was a really big letdown. And it’s hardly the first time the show has made similarly bad choices about how to navigate the story."

Winner’s mother, Billie Winner-Davis, told The Daily Beast even after the DOJ announcement that her family still was not sure why Winner had been arrested.

“I don’t know what they’re alleging,” she said, asking for specifics from the DOJ’s press release. “What do you know?”

Winner-Davis said the allegations against her daughter were vague when they spoke Sunday.

“I don’t know who she might have sent it to,” she said. “[DOJ] were very vague. They said she mishandled and released documents that she shouldn’t have, but we had no idea what it pertained to or who.”

The most her daughter talked about was her pets.

“She called us yesterday night. She asked if we could help out with relocating her cat and dog,” Winner-Davis said.

Winner-Davis said her daughter never talked about her work, and her family did not know the specifics of her recently acquired job as a government contractor. Winner-Davis added that her daughter, while quiet about her job, was outspoken about her beliefs.

“She’s very passionate. Very passionate about her views and things like that, but she’s never to my knowledge been active in politics or any of that,” said Winner-Davis.

On Twitter, Reality Winner expressed frequent dissatisfaction with President Donald Trump’s policies and retweeted a joke about government leaks, as well as a tweet by whistleblower Edward Snowden.

In recent months, she frequently tweeted at Trump. “have you ever even met an Iranian?” she responded to Trump when he tweeted that immigrants coming from seven Muslim-majority countries were “SO DANGEROUS.”

She tweeted “#RESISTANCE” after the U.S. Department of Agriculture began blacking out public information. Immediately after Trump’s election, she took to Twitter to voice her disappointment. “I listened to you daily, and your podcast kept me sane,” she wrote at the FiveThirtyEight podcast on Nov. 9, 2016. “What the heck #betrayed #disillusioned.” She tweeted Sen. Bernie Sanders’ statement calling Trump racist and xenophobic immediately after.

On election night, she tweeted, “Well. People suck.”

Winner is a U.S. Air Force veteran. As a parting gift in November, she wrote, her colleagues gave her a signed and framed photograph of Anderson Cooper, which she showed off in a Facebook post.

“Thank you for your service,” her colleagues wrote on the picture.

It is unclear when Winner might be able to seek bond, her mother said.

“She has a hearing on Thursday about that,” Winner-Davis said.

Garrick’s affidavit indicates that Winner’s arrest was speedy—just a few weeks after she allegedly leaked the report—because she printed out the document and sent an email to The Intercept.

When reporters received the document in the mail, they asked for comment from the intelligence agency that produced it (presumably the National Security Agency, or NSA). And they showed the agency a copy of the document. The copy had visible creases, according to the affidavit, indicating someone printed it out before giving it to the reporters. Investigators found that only six people had printed the report. Of those six, only one had had contact with the news outlet that ultimately published it, according to the affidavit: Winner.

Garrick wrote that he went to Winner’s home in Augusta, Georgia, on June 3, and she acknowledged to him that she mailed the report to the media outlet.

Mark Zaid, a national security lawyer who frequently handles classified matters, told The Daily Beast that Winner is not a whistleblower.

“It is titillating for everyone with respect to political bent as to whether the elections were stolen, perhaps,” he said. “But it has absolutely nothing to do with any waste, fraud, abuse, or—more importantly—illegal U.S. government conduct to justify leaking it.”

Zaid added that Winner also likely would have faced charges under the previous administration and that her arrest doesn’t necessarily portend a crackdown on whistleblowers.

“I think the Obama administration would have prosecuted this same case without hesitation,” he said. “It’s not a partisan political prosecution. It is a case that upholds the lawful obligations that those who have access to classified information adhere to every single day.”

Patrick Toomey, an attorney at the ACLU’s National Security Project, took a different view and said the arrest could be a cause for concern.

“Leaks to journalists occur every day, as they have for decades, and are a vital source of information for the public in our democracy,” he said. “It would be deeply troubling if this prosecution marked the beginning of a draconian crackdown on leaks to the press by the Trump administration.”

Classified leaks have rattled the Trump administration since before the president was inaugurated, and he has promised to find the leakers. Trump surrogates frequently refer to them as the “Deep State.” And political appointees at the Justice Department are eager to prosecute leakers.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions has made numerous public comments about his support of leak prosecutions, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein worked on the successful leak-related prosecution of James Cartwright, a former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

But the Obama administration set the precedent, prosecuting more leakers than all other administrations put together."

Senate Committee on the Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley has launched a new investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s effort to thwart a Bangladesh government corruption probe of Muhammad Yunus, a Clinton Foundation donor and close friend of the Clintons.

The Iowa Republican’s effort is the first new official inquiry of Clinton since her unexpected loss in the 2016 presidential election to President Donald Trump. Trump’s supporters often chanted “lock her up” during his many boisterous campaign rallies.

But upon assuming the presidency, Trump and leaders of the Republican-majority Congress displayed little appetite for reopening investigations of Clinton’s tenure as the chief U.S. diplomat and multiple persistent allegations of “pay-to-play” corruption involving the Clinton Foundation. Until now.

The Daily Caller News Foundation (TheDCNF) Investigative Group exclusively reported in May that Clinton sent top U.S. diplomats to pressure Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheik Hasina and her son Sajeeb Wazed in an effort to kill that country’s corruption investigation of Yunus and Grameen Bank. Yunus was then managing director of the state-owned Bangladesh bank.

In a June 1, 2017, letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Grassley repeated TheDCNF charge that Clinton threatened Wazed with an IRS tax audit if his mother did not back away from the corruption probe. Wazed has lived in the U.S. for 17 years.

“If the Secretary of State used her position to intervene in an independent investigation by a sovereign government simply because of a personal and financial relationship stemming from the Clinton Foundation rather than the legitimate foreign policy interests of the United States, then that would be unacceptable,” Grassley told Tillerson.

“Co-mingling her official position as Secretary of State with her family foundation would be similarly inappropriate. It is vital to determine whether the State Department had any role in the threat of an IRS audit against the son of the Prime Minister in retaliation for this investigation,” Grassley continued.

Grassley described how U.S. ambassadors James Moriarty and Dan Mozena, as well as Jon Danilowica, the Deputy Chief of Mission, met with Wazed in the U.S. Embassy in Dhaka, Bangladesh’s capital, on numerous occasions while the corruption investigation was underway. All three are career diplomats.

Another official, U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Administrator Rajiv Shah also met with Wazed. Shah’s agency awarded $13 million to Yunus organizations and another $11 million to allied Yunus organizations during Clinton’s tenure. The Department of State oversees USAID programs.

As TheDCNF previously reported, Clinton’s aid to Yunus included 18 grants, contracts and loans awarded to two of his America-based foundations, the Grameen Foundation USA and Grameen America, according to USASpending.gov.

Yunus was stripped of his directorship of the state owned Grameen Bank in 2011 as a result of the Bangladesh government’s review of his financial mismanagement of the bank and its “micro-credit” loan program for poor peasants, mainly women.

A Norwegian documentary charging Yunus personally diverted $100 million intended for Grameen Bank and for the poor to his other organizations triggered the initial investigation against him. The pocketing of funds shocked many in poverty-stricken Bangladesh where the annual per capita income is about $3,600, according to the World Bank.

Yunus eventually returned the money to Grameen Bank, but the government’s investigation exposed serious financial mismanagement and found the micro-loan program failed to lift recipients out of poverty. He was forced to resign under a law making 60 the maximum age for the bank’s top position. Yunus was 70 at the time.

Interest rates and payback amounts of the micro-loans sometimes resulted in more poverty, not less. Rather than re-paying the loans, a number of recipients in Bangladesh and India committed suicide.

Clinton’s support for Yunus dates to former President Bill Clinton’s years as Arkansas governor. Both Clintons became micro-credit loan advocates and enthusiastic backers of Yunus, who invented the lending scheme. Bill Clinton reportedly lobbied the Nobel Prize Committee on behalf of Yunus. The committee awarded him the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize.

From 2008 onward, Yunus was a featured speaker at the glitzy Clinton Global Initiative’s annual meeting. He donated between $100,000-$250,000 to CGI and $25,000-$50,000 to the Clinton Foundation, according to the Clinton Foundation website.

Wazed told TheDCNF it was “astounding and mind boggling” to him that between 2010 and 2012 senior State Department officials repeatedly pressured him to influence his mother to drop the Grameen Bank investigation.

“They threatened me with the possibility of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service,” Wazed said. “They would say over and over again, ‘Yunus has powerful friends’ and we all knew they were talking of Secretary Clinton. Everybody knew it was Mrs. Clinton.”

Grassley noted in his letter to Tillerson that Wazed recounted for Senate investigators “two conversations with then-Deputy Chief of Mission to Bangladesh Jon Danilowicz during which Danilowicz mentioned that Wazed may be audited by the IRS if he failed to use his influence to get his mother to drop the investigation into Yunus.”

Grassley added new details stating, “Furthermore, he was told by these same officials that Yunus was communicating with Secretary Clinton and her staff for assistance and, in turn, Secretary Clinton’s staff put pressure on the Embassy in Bangladesh to intercede on Yunus’ behalf.”

The World Bank also unexpectedly decided during Clinton’s tenure in 2012 to rescind a $1.2 billion loan to Bangladesh while the IRS was pressuring Wazed. The funds were sought to build a key bridge near Dhaka.

Clinton’s inner circle of State Department aides kept her apprised of developments throughout the probe. When Clinton confident Melanne Verveer told her of Yunus’ resignation on May 14, 2011, the former secretary of state described it as “sad indeed.”

In 2016, Grassley complained about the Clinton Foundation to former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and to the FBI regarding public corruption charges. However, this is the first time since Trump took office that Grassley renewed an investigation into Clinton, this time for her retaliatory actions against Bangladesh on behalf of Yunus.

Grassley requested that Tillerson provide the judicial panel with all related emails and State Department records or communications by June 15. The senator also asked if the matter had been referred to the Department of Justice or the State Department’s Inspector General. “If not, why not?” Grassley asked Tillerson.

Maj. Gen. Charles Frank Bolden, Jr said NASA is set to release new details this week about the agency’s “unprecedented” mission to “touch the sun.”

The mission, Solar Probe Plus, will launch in summer of 2018 and marks the agency’s first mission to fly into the sun’s atmosphere. Data collected during the mission is expected to improve forecasting of space weather events that impact life on Earth and the lives of astronauts, NASA said in a statement.

“Placed in orbit within four million miles of the sun’s surface, and facing heat and radiation unlike any spacecraft in history, the spacecraft will explore the sun’s outer atmosphere and make critical observations that will answer decades-old questions about the physics of how stars work,” NASA said in a statement.

NASA will make the announcement live on NASA Television and the agency’s website at 11 a.m. ET on Wednesday.

Liberals are constantly bemoaning the Trump base as the angry, last gasps of the White male. That without the disgruntled rural whites, Trump would have had no shot at winning. But this ignores the realities that the left is still having trouble coming to terms with: that Trump won THANKS TO Minority voters.

Trump performed slightly worse with White voters than Romney did. He did far better with the african american vote though, beating both Romney and McCain. His numbers are actually on par with George W Bush in 2000. And he won 30% of the hispanic vote, the best a GOP candidate for President has done with hispanic voters in a long time.

Trump claimed 29 percent of the Hispanic vote on Tuesday compared to Romney’s 27 percent in 2012. With blacks, exit polls show Trump claimed 8 percent of the vote to the previous Republican nominee’s 6 percent.

That means Trump — who liberals swore would lose because of his tough immigration policies — garnered more support from Hispanics than a candidate whose most controversial position was telling undocumented immigrants to “self-deport.”

As for Hillary, she did horrible among minorities, even those who didn’t want Trump.

In dozens of rural counties throughout the Southwest, Clinton performed worse in 2016 than Obama did in 2012, as you can see in the figure below. In Guadalupe County, N.M., about an hour’s drive east of Albuquerque, she received 17 percent less of the vote than Obama did four years ago — 53 percent compared with Obama’s 70 percent. In several other counties where Hispanics accounted for half to nearly all of the population — Rio Arriba, N.M.; Costilla, Colo.; Greenlee, Ariz.; and Duval, Tex., for example — Clinton took home roughly 10 percent fewer votes than did Obama in 2012. In many more heavily Latino counties, her votes lagged behind Obama’s by 3 to 8 points.

Even in the South Texas counties that Latino Decisions has named bulwarks of Clinton support — the Rio Grande Valley below San Antonio, where she won between 70 and 85 percent of the vote — she didn’t do as well as Obama had done four years earlier. In Brooks County, which, according to the 2015 American Community Survey, is 89.5 percent Hispanic, Clinton’s tally was 3.9 percent less than Obama’s. In Zavala County, which is 93.1 percent Hispanic, it was 5.6 percent less. In Duval County, which is 88.8 percent Hispanic, it was 9.8 percent less.

Meanwhile, as you can see below, Trump did much better among Hispanics in the rural Southwest than Romney did. He received a greater share of the vote than Romney had in more than a dozen counties with large Hispanic populations: six percent more than Romney in Starr County, Tex., which is 95.8 percent Hispanic; 7.5 percent more in Costilla County, N.M., which is 63.6 percent Hispanic; and 9.1 percent more in Duval County, Texas, which is 88.8 percent Hispanic.

Clinton may have received more votes than Obama did in many parts of South Texas, where, as a politically-motivated student at Yale Law School, she knocked on doors in predominantly Mexican neighborhoods for the McGovern campaign. But Trump also received more votes in South Texas than Romney did. Clinton rallied thousands more voters, but so did Trump. His supporters there matched the enthusiasm of Clinton’s, just as they did in dozens of rural counties with large Hispanic populations in New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, and Texas.

The left will never admit this, and even now are trying to pin the blame on racist white people for Trump’s election. But the facts are, Trump won all Americans. Not just white ones.

LANAO DEL SUR, Philippines – Marawi City’s Amai Pakpak Avenue has had more soldiers than residents. So have the other streets in the city proper. Since the military started hunting down members of the Maute Group and other terrorists.

on Tuesday, May 23, Lanao del Sur’s capital has been a ghost town.

An eerie silence enveloped major junctions in what was supposed to be the center of trade and activity in the province and home to more than 200,000 people on Thursday, when Rappler took these photos. It was the first time a few media people were able to slip into the besieged city.

Schools and jail had been burned down, mosque and chapels were closed, hospital sieged. Some residents were taken hostage by the terrorists, and later rescued by government forces.

Thousands of residents have fled Marawi to the relative safety of Iligan in Lanao del Norte, and of Cagayan de Oro in Misamis Oriental, enduring hours-long traffic and military checkpoints.

Still, some decided to stay to watch over their closed shops and houses, but later begged that they be brought food and water.

And for every morning that they stayed, explosions and gunshots would wake them up.

President Rodrigo Duterte visited the troops in Iligan City Friday afternoon, May 26, giving them marching orders to arrest every person carrying firearms without authorization, and to shoot them when they fight back.

“Sasamahan ko kayo (I’ll be with you all the way). If you go down, I go down. But for this martial law and the consequences of martial law, and the ramifications of martial law, I and I alone would be responsible. Trabaho lang [kayo]. Ako na bahala (Just do you job, I have your back),” he said.

His defense secretary, Delfin Lorenzana, set a target: the siege of Marawi will be over in a week or less.

The media is going crazy that President Trump shared intelligence on ISIS with Russia, but in 2016 when Obama was President it was a different story.

The headline from 2016 on US cooperation with Russia on sharing top secret intelligence was much more positive then it is now. President Trump meanwhile is defending his decision to share sensitive information about an Islamic State threat with Russian officials.

President Trump focused instead on justifying what he did and blaming those who disclosed it. In a series of early-morning posts on Twitter, he said he had the “absolute right” to give “facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety” to Russia’s foreign minister and ambassador.

Asked about the conversation by reporters during a later appearance with Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president of Turkey, Mr. Trump again did not deny providing the information, but he instead cast it as an attempt to collaborate with Russia in the war against the Islamic State. “We’re going to have a lot of great success over the coming years, and we want to get as many to fight terrorism as possible,” he said.

At dawn on a warm September morning in 2013, a minivan pulled up to a shattered villa in the town of Azaz, Syria. A long-bearded 29-year-old white man emerged from the building, along with his pregnant British wife and their three children, ages 8, 4, and almost 2. They had been in Syria for only about a month this time. The kids were sick and malnourished. The border they’d crossed from Turkey into Syria was minutes away, but the passage back was no longer safe. They clambered into the minivan, sitting on sheepskins draped on the floor—there were no seats—and the driver took them two hours east through a ravaged landscape, eventually stopping at a place where the family might slip into Turkey undetected.

They disembarked amid a grove of thorny trees. Signs warned of land mines. The border itself was more than an hour’s walk away, through the desert. They’d forgotten to bring water. Tania dragged the puking kids along; Yahya carried a suitcase and a stroller. Midway, Tania had contractions, although she was still several months from her due date. They continued on. At the border itself, while the family squeezed through the barbed wire, a sniper’s bullets kicked up dirt nearby.

Yahya had arranged for a human trafficker to meet them, and when the trafficker’s truck arrived, Yahya pressed a few hundred dollars into the man’s hand. Yahya and Tania had been married for 10 years, but they did not say goodbye. Satisfied that his family would not die, Yahya turned and ran across the border, back into Syria—again under gunfire—without even a wave.

The trafficker drove Tania and the kids a short distance into Turkey, then dropped them by the roadside without food or water and sped off. Tania carried the children and luggage toward the nearest town. The day ended with the intercession of a stranger on a motorcycle, who helped carry their things to a bus station. Tania started to leak amniotic fluid due to the journey, and she spent the next weeks recovering in Istanbul, and then with family in London. Six months pregnant, she weighed 96 pounds.

As his family traveled to London, relieved to have escaped the worst place on Earth, Yahya felt relief of his own—he could now pursue his dreams unencumbered by a wife and children. He felt liberated. He carried visions of the caliphate yet to be declared, and ideas for how to shape it. These thoughts were not idle. Yahya, by then, had a small but influential following, and his calm erudition had won him the respect that his teachers and parents had withheld during his youth. His own destiny seemed to be converging with that of the world’s. It was the best day of his life.

first heard the name Yahya Abu Hassan in 2014, while reporting on an article for this magazine about the rise of the Islamic State. I was in a suburb of Melbourne, talking with Musa Cerantonio, an Australian convert to Islam who has served as an unofficial spiritual guide to many English-speaking followers of the group, about its history and theology. (He is now in jail, charged with attempting to travel to Islamic State territory.)

In our earliest conversations, Cerantonio mentioned a fellow convert—a “teacher” or “leader,” he called him—who had done much to prepare Muslims for the religious obligations that would kick in once a caliphate had been established. Cerantonio spoke of his teacher with awe. Yahya was deeply devoted to the idea of the caliphate, he said, and showed a staggering mastery of Islamic law and classical Arabic language and literature. Jihadists in Syria knew him by reputation, and they honored him when they met him.

Cerantonio said that in early 2014, Yahya had pressed the leaders of what was then the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (isis) to declare a caliphate. He began preaching that the conditions for the declaration of a valid caliphate had been met—the group held and governed territory, and its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was a physically and mentally fit male of Qurayshi descent, capable of ruling according to Sharia. Delaying further would mean disregarding a fundamental obligation of Islam.

Yahya had developed a relationship with Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, the group’s spokesman, chief strategist, and director of foreign terror operations. “Yahya was like this with Adnani,” Cerantonio told me, pressing his fingers together. Yahya met with Adnani near Aleppo and warned him that Baghdadi would be in a state of sin if he did not promote himself to caliph immediately. Yahya and his allies had prepared but not yet sent a letter to the emirs of the isis provinces, airing their displeasure at his failure to do so. They were ready to make war on Baghdadi if he delayed further. Adnani replied with good news—that a caliphate had already been declared secretly, months before, and that it would soon be publicly announced.

Yahya shared the update with Cerantonio, who leaked word of the caliphate declaration on Facebook. Within weeks the official public declaration took place in Mosul, Iraq, and Yahya immediately pledged himself to Baghdadi, urging others to do likewise.

The figure of Yahya—an English-speaking convert within isis with powerful connections and the cojones to challenge Baghdadi to a death match—intrigued me. But Cerantonio didn’t elaborate on his identity and referred to him only by an alias, in the traditional Arabic style, with his first name and the name of his firstborn: Yahya, father of Hassan. He said Yahya was a fellow Dhahiri—a member of an obscure, ultra-literalist legal school that had enjoyed a sort of revival within the Islamic State. He didn’t, or wouldn’t, say more. I wrote down the name and committed to investigating Yahya later.

Americans are known to have traveled to Syria as jihadists. Most are knuckleheads. Yahya, it seemed, was unique.

Soon enough, I began collecting clues to his identity. In early 2015, a pro–Islamic State Twitter user (his handle identified him as a “swordsman”) wrote to me and advised me to contact “Abu Yahya” to learn more about the group. The name resembled Yahya Abu Hassan’s closely enough to lead me to believe he was the same person Cerantonio had mentioned. The Twitter user claimed Yahya was Greek. “He is on the field”—in the war zone—“and part of the IS,” the swordsman wrote. “A great mind and a trustworthy student.”

He then shared a link to a website that featured a collection of Dhahiri writings by Cerantonio and a few others—including a “Yahya al-Bahrumi.” In fluent Arabic and English, Yahya wrote prolifically about many jihadist subjects. He projected calm even in his most grotesque opinions, and wore the label irhabi (“terrorist”) with pride:

This word (“terrorist”) has also been cast as an insult and has been received as such. But irhab [“terror”] itself is something notable scholars have declared obligatory and supported verbatim by the Qur’an itself.

He called for emigration to lands where Sharia would be fully enforced, and wrote that choosing not to emigrate was a form of apostasy:

Call me extreme, but I would imagine that all of those who willingly choose to live among those with whom Muslims are at war are themselves at war with Muslims—and as such, are not actually Muslims. Get out if you can—not only in support of your brothers and sisters whom your taxes have been killing, but also to protect yourselves from the punishment Allah has ordained for those who betray the nation.

He called for Muslims to hate, fight, and kill infidels—among whom, he said, were many so-called Muslims who nullified their faith by neglecting prayer, deviating from the narrow literalism of his interpretation of scripture, or, in the case of rulers, not instituting the brutal system of justice for which the Islamic State was then becoming famous.

In dozens of articles posted over several years, Yahya demonstrated knowledge of classical Arabic—the notoriously difficult language of educated religious speech—and familiarity with Islamic sources and history. His Arabic was stunning even to Cerantonio, an extremely self-confident religious autodidact. Cerantonio told me that another Muslim in their internet discussion group had once challenged a theological point Yahya had made. “Then Yahya did something that shocked us all,” Cerantonio said. “He responded to the guy in traditional Arabic poetry that he devised off the top of his head, using the guy’s name in the poetry, explaining the situation, and answering his objections.” For any claim, it seemed, Yahya could instantly spout textual support, and confronted with any counterclaim, he could undercut the argument with a sweep of the leg.

The website the swordsman had pointed me to included a narrative biography and a small photo of Yahya, its founder. The picture showed a bearded, bespectacled young man with a Kalashnikov over his shoulder. He was dressed for cold weather, as if in preparation for a night raid or patrol. When I saw him, I wondered when I had last seen someone looking so content.

As for the biography itself, nearly every word showed signs of careful selection, including his name, Bahrumi, a portmanteau of the Arabic words bahr (“sea”) and rumi (“Roman”). Many jihadists construct a nom de guerre from their first name and their national origin. He called himself Yahya of the Roman Sea, or Yahya the Mediterranean.

The biography continued:

His roots are from the island of Crete in the Roman sea (Bahr al-Rūm). Born in 1404 [a.d. 1983–84] and raised as a Nazarene [Christian], Yahya then entered Islam in 1422 [a.d. 2001–02]. He traveled seeking knowledge and work in the path of Allah until Allah granted him hijrah [migration] to Sham. He now resides in the countryside of Aleppo.

Now I thought I had enough data to narrow down his identity: a philologically inclined Cretan jihadist convert not just to Islam but to Dhahirism, a minuscule legal school. The list of candidates could not be long.

Many converts choose Arabic names that are the equivalent of their birth names. Yahya is Arabic for John, in English, or Ioannis in Greek, so I began searching online for Dhahiris with these names. In a German-language jihadist chat room, I found a reference to “Ioannis Georgilakis,” and here the trail began to sizzle under my feet. Georgilakis’s Facebook page showed photos of the same hirsute young man with glasses, dressed in Muslim garments and playing with his kids.

As I looked at his Facebook page, I began to wonder whether the Greek was an affectation. Many of his Facebook friends were English speakers, and few were Greek. Georgilakis isn’t an especially common surname, and given Yahya’s apparent creativity in self-naming, I tried a few permutations, including the English John and the vanilla, non-Cretan Greek version of Georgilakis, which would be Georgelas.

One of the first hits on Google for John Georgelas was an August 15, 2006, press release from the Department of Justice. “Supporter of Pro-Jihad Website Sentenced to 34 Months,” it crowed. At the time of his conviction, he lived in North Texas, near Plano, 20 minutes’ drive from the house where I grew up.

American muslims are rare in the Islamic State: Only 53 are publicly known to have traveled to Syria as jihadists, according to Seamus Hughes, the deputy director of George Washington University’s Program on Extremism. (The United States has stopped more than 100 others in the process of preparing to travel, or to act on behalf of the Islamic State in America.)

Hughes, a former Senate staffer, has meticulously cataloged the Americans who have made it to Syria, and places nearly all of them in the category of “knuckleheads”—brawny idiots with little hope of understanding a discussion of Islamic theology. Many have by now fulfilled their dream of battlefield death; all that remains of them is a martyrdom notice, posted like a headstone, on their Facebook page.

However canny the Islamic State’s internet-based recruiting, a personal touch remains crucial to fully radicalizing most targets and signing up new terrorists. In the United Kingdom, more than 100 fighters have waged jihad after contact with a group called Al Muhajiroun; in Belgium, Sharia4Belgium has recruited numerous Islamic State fighters. But in the United States, groups like these exist only in the fever dreams of Islamophobes.

Fewer than 20 percent of the Americans in the Islamic State are known to be converts to Islam, and many have long-standing family connections with other countries—long periods of residence in Kuwait, say, or ties to the Somali tribes of their parents. They do not, as a rule, ascend to high positions in the Islamic State’s organization. One Bosnian American, Abdullah Pazara, parlayed Serbian military training into command of an isis tank battalion. But even Pazara (who died in 2014) was relatively obscure and uncelebrated. In the United States, his most glorious achievement was owning a barely profitable trucking company.

Not all recruits are stupid. At least three have a college education and, according to friends and family, good academic records and habits. The smart ones, though, have in effect renounced their learning in favor of the greater glory of jihad. Having made it onto the dean’s list for a degree in computer science counts neither for nor against you if your goal is to explode in a crowd of apostates.

Yahya, it seemed to me, was unique. He in some ways resembled his fellow Americans in Syria: He went to fight, and he would have welcomed a battlefield death if God had willed it. But he was no mere foot soldier; his religious scholarship, connections, and standing distinguished him—even if I didn’t then understand their full extent. I wanted to know more.

Plano is a short drive from downtown Dallas, toward the Oklahoma border, a flatland sprouting subdivisions watered by money from the region’s burgeoning tech sector. Shortly after his probation expired, John Georgelas had posted a résumé online listing as his address an elegant brick house with white Doric columns, a small portico, and a circular driveway. In August 2015, when I first drove up, I could hear the happiness of children. I saw a boy, who looked about 10, bouncing a basketball in the driveway and two others playing nearby; they were about the same ages as the kids in the Facebook photos. As I approached the front door, I spied a yellow-ribbon decal (“We support our troops”) in the window, and behind it a foyer, tidy and richly decorated, and a piano festooned with family photos.

The man who answered the door was Timothy Georgelas, John’s father and the owner (with his wife, John’s mother, Martha) of the house. Both parents are Americans of Greek ancestry.Tim is a West Point graduate and a physician. He has a full head of gray hair and soft features that betray no sign of the stress of having raised an Islamic State terrorist. He has, however, no illusions about the life his son has chosen. “He and John are enemies,” I was told by someone who knows them both—“until the Day of Judgment.” Tim wore shorts and a T-shirt, and a crisp draft of air conditioning escaped as he said good morning. When I told him I had come to ask about John, he stepped outside and shut the door as if to seal off the house from his son’s name. He slumped in a white wicker chair by the front door, and with a reluctant gesture, he invited me to sit across from him. He stared at the magnolia tree in the front yard and said nothing. I told him what I knew—that his son, John, was Yahya. Tim sat, lips pursed, and with a shake of his head began to speak. “Every step of his life he’s made the wrong decisions, from high school onward,” Tim told me. “It is beyond me to understand why he threw what he had away.” Two of Yahya’s sisters have earned advanced degrees, he added, as if to demonstrate that it wasn’t failed parenting that led his only son to drop out of school, wage holy war, and plot mass murder.

“He was always the youngest kid in the class, and always a follower,” Tim said. “I have bailed him out so many times—financially, in circumstances with his wife and kids, you name it. I always pick up the wreckage.” The Yahya Tim described to me was a sad figure, a sheep who had strayed into a wicked flock. Above all, he was easily manipulated. This, for me, was another puzzle. The Yahya I had encountered online, and the one Musa Cerantonio described, was nothing like a sheep, and no pathetic follower. He was not the boy his father described. At some point, Yahya had shape-shifted into a wolf, into a leader of men. In december 1983, John Thomas Georgelas was born into a wealthy family with a long military tradition. His grandfather Colonel John Georgelas was wounded twice in the Second World War and worked for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Tim Georgelas spent three years in the U.S. Army, then accepted an Air Force commission to attend medical school. He retired as a colonel in 2001, and now practices radiology in a north-Dallas breast-imaging clinic. He is politically conservative, as is Martha, his short, dark-haired wife, whose Facebook cover photo shows her standing proudly in front of the George W. Bush Presidential Center, near downtown Dallas. The Georgelases moved frequently during John’s youth, as Tim’s military assignments required. John entered school at the age of 4, while the family was living in England, and he was young and small for his class. He was sickly—he grew benign tumors and had brittle bones—and his infirmities may have pushed him toward religion. When he was 11, his leg shattered, and he spent a long period out of school, recuperating. Lonely and depressed, his mind turned to God in idle moments, and he became attached to the Greek Orthodox Church. Wheelchair-bound, he hounded his family into attending services more regularly. Among his spiritual mentors was a clergyman who encouraged John to hate and distrust Muslims, with an intensity that would later change its polarity. (A family member calls John’s attitude one of “righteous fury, jacked up with certainty”—a bright-burning sanctimony that has been consistent across his religious transformations.) As the family’s male heir, John enjoyed a special status in the Georgelas patriarchy. With that status came expectations, and therefore disappointment when it became clear he was unsuited for a soldier’s life. His body refused to grow into robust, battle-ready form. Tim is tall, a former high-school quarterback, but John was shorter, his torso tending to pudge. His temperament wasn’t suited to military discipline. When he returned to school after his leg injury, he had little interest in academic achievement or rule-following. His father tried repeatedly to correct his behavior and failed. (This account is drawn from sources close to John, including family members, co-workers, friends, and correctional officers.) When John uttered the Muslim declaration of faith, the ashes of the World Trade Center were barely cool. Nor did he fit in well with his peers. He gravitated toward the skateboard set, and he didn’t date much, if at all. (One acquaintance told me, “If you put a million bucks on the table and told him to use it to go get laid, he couldn’t do it to save his life.”) Like many a military brat before him, John experimented with the counterculture. He smoked pot, dropped acid, and ate magic mushrooms. He hated his father for punishing his drug use and hated the U.S. government for criminalizing it. By the time he graduated from high school, his primary interests were computer hacking, skateboarding, and the voracious consumption of psychedelics. His grades were miserable, Tim says, but his standardized-test scores were better than those of his high-achieving sisters. John ended up studying philosophy at the College Station branch of Blinn College, an open-admission junior college in central Texas. He passed only a few classes. In a class on world religions at Blinn, the instructor’s cursory lecture on Islam annoyed him, so John sought more information from local Muslims. Curiosity turned to something more, as he discovered that Muslims were not the demons he had been led to expect them to be. A few days before Thanksgiving 2001, on the first day of Ramadan, John converted at a mosque in College Station frequented by foreign students from Texas A&M. Whether the conversion was meant to spite his parents or whether spite was just an ancillary benefit of his spiritual salvation, it is not possible to say. But the timing is suggestive. When John uttered the Muslim declaration of faith, the ashes of the World Trade Center were barely cool. Anti-Muslim sentiment in America was reaching new highs, and in central Texas, conversion to Islam would have been a singular act of rebellion. John’s parents found his conversion to be a sign of mental weakness. “Every university town in this country has a mosque for one reason,” Tim told me. “Kids are away from home for the first time, vulnerable and subject to influence. They hear the message and they’re hooked, and that’s what happened to John.” John took the name Yahya, and sold his pickup truck to buy a plane ticket. In December 2001, the family received an email from Yahya announcing that he was in Damascus learning Arabic. Western jihadists find their way to violence many different ways, but they often match a profile. And that profile fit John like a wet suit. He came from an upper-middle-class family. He squandered opportunities commensurate with his innate talent; he recognized that he would not excel in the fields chosen or glorified by his parents and authority figures. Often, a personal crisis—a death in the family, a near-death experience of one’s own—triggers existential contemplation, leading to religious exploration; in John’s case, his childhood frailty might have filled that role. Jihadists are also overwhelmingly left-brained, quantitative-analytic types. Diego Gambetta of the European University Institute and Steffen Hertog of the London School of Economics have noted a preponderance of former engineering students among jihadists; they suggest that the mental style of that discipline disposes certain people toward jihadism. As a teen, John had taught himself to program. His computers ran the Linux operating system, not the Windows or Mac software favored by the masses. Years later, after he had become a full-blown jihadist, he would share a line of C++ code on his website, a geeky statement of his own hard-line stance: if (1+1+1 != 1 && 1 == 1) return true; else die(); Translation: If you believe the Christian Trinity (“1+1+1”) is not really monotheistic (“!= 1”), and if you believe in the unity of God (“1 == 1”), then great. Otherwise: Die. Despite these binary inclinations, upon his arrival in Damascus Yahya envisioned himself as a Sufi, a Muslim mystic who sought oneness with God through poetry, perhaps, or dance or song, and who could countenance a shaded, or nuanced, version of Islam. That posture may have been a holdover from his counterculture teens. Gradually, though, under the influence of British Muslims who were more rigid in their approach to the faith, he became jihad-curious. They persuaded him to follow a bin-Ladenist approach, hostile to Sufism, instead. Yahya soon surpassed them in intolerance. To his jihadism he added general displeasure with the hierarchy of scholarly authority in mainstream religion. He objected to mainstream imams’ telling him to trust the words of scholars and not to attempt his own interpretation of scripture and law. Muslim laymen are generally advised not to derive legal rulings on their own, and to follow more-experienced scholars. But Yahya maintained a typically American can-do attitude toward his religion, similar to the one many Texans adopt toward their trucks: If he couldn’t understand or fix it himself, it didn’t feel like his. He acquired The Hans Wehr Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic, a cuboid volume that is the standard Arabic-English reference work. It is not meant to be read through. The typical student of Arabic keeps the Hans Wehr on a corner of his desk and consults it as needed for the rest of his natural life. Yahya memorized it in six months. Then, as a chaser, he memorized Kitab al-Ayn, the eighth-century Arabic dictionary by al-Khalil al-Farahidi. He wandered through Damascus, chatting up everyone and learning classical Arabic to a level of proficiency rarely achieved even by educated native Arabic speakers. He drifted further from his parents and sisters. Later, when counseling other Muslims about how much effort to put into proselytization at home versus heading directly to the Islamic State, Yahya wrote: What about those [Muslims] who are trying to work on their families, but their families insist on kufr [disbelief in Islam]? Should they wait their whole lives in patience, trying to guide someone whom Allah has not chosen for guidance, or should they move on and help their true family: the Muslims? Yahya met his wife in 2003 on a Muslim matrimonial site. Tania was born in London in 1983 to Bengali British parents. It was almost as if they had shared the same life, before even being introduced. Like Yahya, Tania grew up riddled with benign tumors and incorrigibly rebellious. She tormented her parents by practicing, with alarming vigor, the religion they had neglected in the pursuit of an assimilated English middle-class existence. She was a pretty girl, a petite firecracker. But her mischief was not of the usual variety, like dating boys her parents didn’t approve of. When her parents suggested that she try to meet boys, Tania hissed “Muslims don’t date.” She had a type: Her heartthrob was John Walker Lindh, the American who fought for the Taliban in 2001. She swore that until marriage no strange man would know anything more of her physical appearance than its cloaked outline, and by her late teens she was draping herself in a full-body covering, or jilbab. She fantasized about packing a bomb under it. At 19, she married Yahya. Yahya and Tania lied to anyone who inquired about their activities. When Syrian government spies started asking neighbors about them, they moved on. After meeting online, Yahya and Tania fell in love fast, and just as couples bond over Netflix or jogging or cooking, they bonded over jihad and a shared capacity for bad decisions. After a month of digital flirtation, Yahya flew to London, and they met in person on March 15, 2003. Within three days they married secretly, then left for Texas. They settled in College Station and partook of the pleasures of freedom, young love, and independence from family. They lived cheaply and happily, embracing as their community the foreign students at the mosque where Yahya had converted. The mosque threw them a wedding party, and rich Gulf Arabs who lived near the university kicked in money to support Yahya’s continued study of Islam. The couple indulged, too, in their other shared passion: getting high. Islamic orthodoxy considers cannabis an intoxicant, and therefore forbidden. But Yahya’s practice of Islam was unconventional even then. In a historical essay titled “Cannabis,” heavily footnoted with classical Arabic sources, he made the Islamic case for pot. There was evidence, he wrote, that early Islamic leaders had taxed hemp seeds. Since Muslims generally cannot tax forbidden substances, such as pork or alcohol, Yahya reasoned, they must have considered pot permissible. As for psilocybin: Yahya cited an obscure hadith (a report of the sayings and actions of Muhammad) that he said described Muhammad’s having descended from a mountain after meditation and extolling the medicinal properties of mushrooms—particularly as a cure for diseases of the eye. Yahya and Tania took this to mean that God had sanctioned the ingestion of psychedelic mushrooms. So the young lovers blissed out under the Texas sky, shrooming after the example of the prophet himself. In late 2003, Yahya and Tania traveled to Damascus for an extended honeymoon, living there furtively and quietly associating with other jihadists. Their existence mirrored that of many young radical tumbleweeds of yesteryear: Black Panthers, Baader-Meinhof gangsters, fin de siècle anarchists. They dodged the authorities and lied to anyone who inquired about their activities. When Syrian government spies started asking neighbors about them, they moved on, settling briefly in a town selected because it was prophesied to be the headquarters of the prophet Jesus upon his return. They often quarreled. Still strong-willed, Tania wanted to obey only God. But God’s words were unequivocal: “Men are in charge over women,” says a Koranic verse. So for most of the 10 years before the founding of the Islamic State, Yahya maintained a Rasputinlike control over her. He hadn’t had much success finding social esteem in his prior life, but in Tania he found his first student. He mesmerized her with his confidence, and she repressed her own misgivings whenever she found herself questioning him. Tania has mild dyslexia; Yahya’s reading of Islamic texts convinced her, with his fluency and recall and breadth, that he could produce an unanswerable argument about any point on which she disagreed. She determined that Yahya was a genius with gifts God had denied her, and she accepted her place in the world of jihad: Service to Yahya was her ticket to heaven. She endorsed slavery, apocalypse, polygamy, and killing. She aspired to raise seven boys as holy warriors—one to conquer each continent. From Syria they returned to London, where Yahya chose to follow a Jordanian known as Abu Issa. He had allegedly fought the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s, and on April 3, 1993, his followers there swore loyalty to him and created what the French scholar Kévin Jackson calls “the forgotten caliphate,” an unsuccessful precursor of the Islamic State. Abu Issa declared himself caliph and ruled a small portion of Afghanistan’s Kunar province in the mid-to-late 1990s. There he implemented many practices that the Islamic State would later realize on a larger scale. The total area governed did not extend beyond a few small towns, and the local Afghans despised Abu Issa and his supporters. When Osama bin Laden came to Afghanistan in 1996, Abu Issa sent a message demanding his obedience. (There is no record of a reply.) In the late 1990s, when the Taliban took over Kunar province, Abu Issa and his followers relocated to London, and it was in that diminished state that Yahya and Tania first encountered them. For a while, Yahya had the jihadist-dork dream job of tutoring the caliph’s son in the subjects of computer hacking and martial arts. Ultimately Yahya and Abu Issa fell out over a dispute regarding interpretation of Islamic law. But during that period, Yahya nurtured an interest in the obligation to declare a caliphate and in Islamic literalism, both of which would drive him, in the end, back to Syria. At a bookshop in London, he found a copy of the works of Ibn Hazm (994–1064), by far the greatest Dhahiri scholar. Dhahirism is the most binary and monochrome of Islamic legal schools. In some ways, it resembles the constitutional originalism of Clarence Thomas or Antonin Scalia: It drastically and pitilessly winnows down the sources of legal authority to the Koran, the sayings and actions of Muhammad, and the ironclad consensus of the prophet’s followers within his own lifetime. It refuses to accept new laws based on analogy to old ones, and it urges jurists and theologians to resist allegorical or figurative readings, and instead stick to rulings with plain textual support.The rejection of figurative readings, legal analogy, and other types of extended interpretation strikes most mainstream Muslim scholars as preposterous. But through Dhahiri eyes, scripture should simply be read like a manual—or like software. It is a legal and theological methodology that aligned well with Yahya’s left-brained, autodidactic disposition. In september 2004, Yahya and Tania returned to the United States, relying financially on Yahya’s parents. They settled briefly in Torrance, California, with Yahya hoping to find work as an imam. His jihadism disqualified him for mosque jobs, however, and increasingly the two sought only each other’s spiritual camaraderie. They stopped frequenting mosques altogether, on the grounds that they were dens of spies. When a SWAT team came to their house in Grapevine, Texas, early in the morning, Yahya and Tania were already awake for dawn prayers. In 2004, their first son was born in California. Yahya and Tania moved back to greater Dallas, and a year later, Yahya took a job as a data technician at Rackspace, a server company in Texas. At night, he cruised jihadist forums and offered tech support to Jihad Unspun, a Canada-based Islamist news site widely thought to be a recruiting ground for would-be terrorists. He also looked for ways to use his position at Rackspace to wage jihad. On April 8, 2006, he accessed the passwords of a client, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, with the intention of hijacking its website. As hacking jobs go, it was amateurish. Rackspace found out, and the FBI, aware of Yahya’s terror links, moved fast. When a swat team came to his house in Grapevine, Texas, early in the morning, he and Tania were already awake for dawn prayers. He surrendered peacefully and warned that a child was sleeping inside and that his wife needed to get dressed. The Department of Justice prosecuted him for hacking into a protected computer—this was the source of the press release I had found earlier—and a judge sentenced him to 34 months’ imprisonment. Prior to his arrest, he had planned to travel to Iraq to fight against the Americans, so prison may have saved his life. Yahya’s arrest caused marital friction of a new sort. With her husband in prison and studying Islamic texts full-time, Tania began asserting her independence. After receiving scowls from neighbors due to her Muslim dress, she told Yahya she planned to wear just a veil, and not a full-body cloak. Yahya, furious, demanded that she cover herself fully when she visited him in prison, to be sure no one would titter at the immodesty of the sheikh’s wife. (He had Muslim acquaintances in prison and was the most scholarly among them.) He told her to leave infidel America to join the group known as the Nigerian Taliban, a predecessor to Boko Haram. She refused and threatened divorce. But she didn’t leave him—even after he got out of prison and took a second wife, a Jamaican British friend of Tania’s. Tania did not approve, but she didn’t forbid the union. The bride still lived in London, and the groom could not travel without violating parole. Yahya investigated the Islamic legality of a marriage conducted across physical distance. He found precedent: Muhammad had married the widow of his brother-in-law when she was in Ethiopia and he was in Medina. Having ascertained the validity of marriage-by-telecom, Yahya and his second wife married over the phone, with Tania present and quietly fuming. (Yahya later divorced his second wife.) About his crimes, he remained unrepentant. “He can justify anything he does, and he didn’t think he did anything wrong,” Tim says. “He is just full of himself.” During his parole, Yahya lived in Dallas and worked as an IT specialist for a shoe wholesaler. In August 2009, 10 months after he’d left prison, a second child arrived, another boy. The extended Georgelas family took a trip to Hawaii, and the couple came along. Tania stayed secluded, says one acquaintance, and Yahya harangued everyone about the virtues of Sharia law. But he mostly stayed quiet during that period. The family wondered whether he had mellowed, though Yahya’s colleagues at the shoe company report that he and Tania occasionally posted politically worrisome items on Facebook. On october 1, 2011, Yahya’s parole expired, and he drove to the Dallas–Fort Worth airport with his wife and two children, a free man. He was leaving America—probably for good. “Muslims in America,” he wrote around that time, “remember: Hijrah is always an option and sometimes an obligation.” The family flew to London, then Cairo. Yahya and Tania lived in Egypt for the next two years, at first happily: The boys were clever and precocious—YouTube videos show the younger one reading words in English, French, and Arabic before the age of 3—and they were joined on Christmas Day 2011 by another boy. The family sailed feluccas on the Nile and savored life beyond the reach of the U.S. government. Yahya earned money by translating fatwas from the salaried religious scholars of the government of Qatar. Ever allergic to human authority, he seethed at the banality of the fatwas and the government clerics’ abject servitude to tyrants. None of the fatwas ever mentioned what he considered the core imperatives of Islam, stressed by Ibn Hazm a thousand years before, such as the establishment of a caliphate and emigration from lands of disbelief. The scholars relentlessly glorified the Qatari royal family. The fatwas, Yahya claimed, were based not on evidence but on mere opinion. In Cairo, Yahya met other jihadists and became respected for his scholarly rigor. One person who knew him then describes him as one of the strongest pre- isis pro-caliphate voices, and says the online seminars he conducted in Arabic and English did much to “prepare” Westerners for the declaration of the caliphate that would come a few years later. Musa Cerantonio, who would become his leading Australian disciple, met him digitally. European jihadists began traveling to Egypt to learn from him. He impressed one sheikh so much that the man declared that it would be sinful for Yahya to expose himself to danger on the battlefield in a conflict like Afghanistan’s or Syria’s. “Your blood is haram,” he said—forbidden to spill.In his sermons and public statements, Yahya anticipated many of the themes of Islamic State propaganda, including distrust of Islamist movements that compromised their religion by partaking in secular politics. On social media, Tania supported his views, but with each child she bore, her eagerness to join the jihad by then under way in Syria waned. Yahya reminded her that the Koran judges harshly those who give up on hijrah: Angels will rip their souls from their mortal bodies and prepare them for judgment by God. “The angels will say, ‘Was not God’s earth spacious [enough] for you to emigrate in it?’ For those, their refuge is Hell.” In July 2013, a secular military coup toppled the Muslim Brotherhood–led government in Egypt, and the Islamist moment there passed as quickly as it had arrived. Yahya and Tania fretted about the possible consequences for them as jihadists, and sought escape. Cerantonio encouraged them to consider the southern Philippines, where he was living at the time. It turned out to be too rustic. “Look, I’m happy to be in, like, a mud hut,” Yahya said to him. “But my wife is very specific and is asking you to take photos of houses.” The houses were inadequate, so they scrapped that plan. Ultimately, the Syrian civil war presented opportunities that Yahya couldn’t decline. His poetry frequently had a martial tone: Rise, cut ties: spies disguised in white,

by the sword, for the Lord of Might

Defeat the cheat, trite fleet of fright,

by rod—by God!—by baud, by byte. For years before the Islamic State’s rise, Yahya had said his weapon of choice was the keyboard (“by baud, by byte”). But now that Syria was becoming the battlefield he had dreamed of, he was ready to take up other arms. When they left Cairo, Yahya insisted on going to Turkey. Once there, in August 2013, he took his family onto a bus and told them they were going on a trip. He did not reveal their destination until Tania (now almost five months pregnant with their fourth child) saw the Syrian border. By then, the Assad government had lost control of large parts of northern Syria, and around Aleppo, factions were working with and against one another. The region had become an anarchic wasteland haunted by death. They squatted in a villa, the abandoned residence of a Syrian general, in the town of Azaz, a few miles inside the border. The windows had been smashed and the plumbing shut off, but the chandeliers were still hanging. Mujahideen groups controlled the territory, and Yahya’s connections assured his family a meager supply of food. He spent days with jihadist friends. He had known some of them only in an online fantasy life; now they were comrades in arms. Tania and the children got sick and developed mysterious infections. She prepared herself for the possibility that government forces or other rebels would overrun their position. But she also still loved the rush, and was curious about the fighting nearby. She wanted to see the action, but because she was a woman, when she poked her head out the window, she was told to be sensible and get back inside. When she complained to Yahya about being brought into a war zone without consultation—“How could you do this to us?”—he cited a hadith: “War,” he said, “is deception.” She finally decided: Ten years of this was enough. She demanded to take the kids back to Turkey. Yahya could not or would not join them. He had come to fight for isis, and he knew the penalty in the afterlife for retreating from the battlefield. But his kids were not mujahideen, so he let them go—across a minefield, through sniper fire, back into Turkey—with the assumption that the family would reunite, in this world or the next. Tania made reverse hijrah to Plano, moved into Tim and Martha’s house, and gave birth to a boy, her fourth, in January 2014. In December 2014, she petitioned for divorce. Her own transformation has been bittersweet. These days she describes herself as “agnostic,” and has said, in her discussions with friends online, that she is “a lost cause to Muslims now.” In her social-media postings, she looks like any other painted-lady infidel of north Dallas. She dresses stylishly, baring a shoulder now and then, and has highlights in her dark hair. Still in her early 30s, she looks free, even reborn. “Some people would make takfir of me”—excommunicate her—“for this,” she writes. “But I have hope in God that he understands my weaknesses.” Many would call Yahya’s treatment of Tania unforgivable and urge her to forget him. But the two have shared most of their adult lives, in difficult and thrilling circumstances. She has left jihadism, but she cannot completely leave Yahya. On social media, she wrote to a relative of her husband’s: Where do I begin discussing the ‘Ioannis complex’? … He’s a man torn between two worlds, well actually four or more in his case (East vs. West, religious principles vs. family and happiness) … We made some really poor choices that backfired on us … Ioannis is fixated on changing the hearts and minds of people and the course of history. I’m somewhat jealous of the love and devotion he has for Islam over me. That devotion has not wavered. After he turned away from his wife and children that day in 2013, Yahya added a new and unlikely chapter to the Georgelas military tradition. For several months, he trained as a soldier as part of an Islamic State–aligned group near Aleppo. He saw battle there, and during combat in April 2014, a mortar blast sent shrapnel into his back, nearly severing his spine. “I was in immense pain,” he wrote on his website, “but I at least knew that my reward is with Allah and that comforted me greatly.” He spent time in a hospital in Turkey. Then, fearing detection as an American (he could pass as Syrian, but not indefinitely), he went back to Syria and received treatment from Adam Brookman, an Australian alleged jihadist who has since returned to Australia and is under arrest (Brookman, a nurse, maintains that he went to Syria solely for humanitarian reasons). Yahya posted images on Facebook of his suppurating wounds and of himself on bed rest, smiling. The scars are, for him as for other jihadists, a VIP pass in the afterlife, a badge of honor that shows his commitment to God during his time on Earth. His injuries left him temporarily unable to walk—disabled again, 20 years after his first leg injury. But he was content and proud. A fellow jihadist posted a photograph of a grinning, bespectacled Yahya on Facebook, with the caption “American muhajir injured in reef halab [the outskirts of Aleppo] by mortar shrapnel Alhamdulillah improving and cant wait to get back on his feet.” During that period he took up with a new wife, a Syrian, and had a daughter with her about a year after Tania’s departure, and another some time later. Throughout his convalescence, he continued to tweet and write aggressively in favor of isis, though he was not yet in isis territory. His website, still obscure, attracted more followers, though it remained a highbrow product, too scholarly for the masses. It was around this time that he began pestering isis’s leaders—particularly Adnani—to declare a caliphate. When the declaration happened, in June 2014, Yahya was living near Aleppo, about 100 miles from Raqqah, the Islamic State’s capital. “This is the moment I have been waiting [for] for years,” he wrote. He immediately committed to moving to Raqqah. His plans were thwarted for a time after the Free Syrian Army captured him. He was eventually released, and silently vowed to return to behead his captors. For a brief while he feigned cooperation with the group. But in mid-2015, he made his way to the caliphate’s capital. His shattered back would have earned him exemption from frontline military duty—but isis’s leadership by then recognized that his talents were best put to use not as a grunt but as a scholar and spokesman. On December 8, 2015, Yahya’s voice came through clearly on Al Bayan radio—the voice of the Islamic State. He is now the Islamic State’s leading producer of high-end English-language propaganda as a prolific writer for its flagship magazines, Dabiq and Rumiyah. For a while, he tweeted under pseudonyms, but in keeping with a general Islamic State move toward other, better-encrypted media, he stopped and now appears to be limited to official channels. The profile photo for one of his last personal Twitter accounts is a well-worn laptop with a Browning 9 mm semiautomatic handgun resting across the keyboard. Yahya is the Islamic State’s leading producer of high-end English-language propaganda. Recently, clues have emerged that he may be much more. The first article in Dabiq that I have been able to confirm was written by Yahya was published in April 2016, and took as its subject Western Muslims who, despite calling themselves Muslims, are infidels. The headline, “Kill the Imams of Kufr [Disbelief] in the West,” was only marginally less grotesque than the accompanying design: crosshairs over images of prominent mainstream Western Muslims; an image of a crouching, blindfolded “apostate” at the moment an executioner’s blade enters his neck. In the article, Yahya recounted many stories of Muhammad and his companions’ harsh treatment of Muslims who had lapsed. Hands and feet are severed, eyes gouged out with nails, bodies stomped to death. The issue that followed bore Yahya’s fingerprints everywhere. A polemical article about Christianity notes, with a familiar pedantry and some of Yahya’s favorite Bible verses, inconsistencies between Christian doctrine and the historical record. Some articles are clearly his, and others, whether his or not, use the voice he has perfected. Unsigned, but likely written by Yahya, is the pellucid “Why We Hate You & Why We Fight You,” which avows the religious nature of the war. “We hate you, first and foremost, because you are disbelievers,” it begins. The article reads like a distillation of every conversation I have ever had with a jihadist: The fact is, even if you were to stop bombing us, imprisoning us, torturing us, vilifying us, and usurping our lands, we would continue to hate you because our primary reason for hating you will not cease to exist until you embrace Islam … What’s equally if not more important to understand is that we fight you, not simply to punish and deter you, but to bring you true freedom in this life and salvation in the Hereafter, freedom from being enslaved to your whims and desires as well as those of your clergy and legislatures, and salvation by worshipping your Creator alone and following His messenger. The Islamic State has staked its survival on creating a revolutionary Muslim mass movement—one that can compensate for its loss of territory in Iraq and Syria by rising up elsewhere. With Yahya it lends an American accent to its universal jihadist message, and a speaker whose strengths, weaknesses, personality, and insecurities are deeply American as well. He knows how to speak to Americans, how to scare them, how to recruit them—how to make the Islamic State’s war theirs. It is unknown how far Yahya’s role extends beyond keyboard jihad. But clues have very recently emerged that point toward an extraordinary possibility. In August, a drone killed Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, the Islamic State’s most powerful leader save for Baghdadi himself, and—according to Musa Cerantonio—Yahya’s friend and patron. Adnani is widely suspected of having directed foreign terrorist attacks on behalf of the Islamic State, including the mass murder of restaurant- and concertgoers in Paris in November 2015. The suspected operational mastermind of that attack, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, was emir of the foreign fighters in Azaz around the time of Yahya’s residence there. Adnani himself was from the town of Binnish, also in northwestern Syria. Adnani’s death left a job opening, and on December 5, 2016, the Islamic State announced the name of his successor: Abu al‑Hassan al-Muhajir. That name is nearly identical to an active alias of John Georgelas, Abu Hassān al-Muhajir. (A muhajir is someone who has immigrated to the Islamic State, a foreign fighter rather than a Syrian or an Iraqi.) The title inherited by “Abu al-Hassan” is mutahaddith, or “spokesman.” The job may or may not include Adnani’s responsibility for directing overseas attacks. It certainly means that the Islamic State—in all its official pronouncements, its incitements to terror, its encouragements of its supporters—will speak in Abu al-Hassan’s words. The voice that delivered the December 5 speech was not Yahya’s. But the Islamic State has altered voices in the past, to protect the identities of key figures—and however fluent Yahya’s Arabic is, it might have preferred a native speaker to deliver a prepared text under his name. “Al-Muhajir” is an epithet shared by a significant percentage of foreign fighters (though most go by a more specific origin-name, such as “the Belgian” or “the Tunisian”), and many jihadists would have a firstborn son named Hassan; it is a relatively common name. The Islamic State likely includes more than one person with the name Abu al-Hassan al-Muhajir, although I can find no record of anyone in the Islamic State using that name or Yahya’s variant before December 5, other than Yahya himself. For Yahya to occupy such a celebrated position would mean an improbable ascent through an organization dominated by Syrians and Iraqis. To succeed Adnani directly would mean leapfrogging numerous other candidates with greater seniority and previous authority in the group. No analyst with whom I have spoken thinks it likely that an American could rise so high in the group. But no other American is quite like Yahya, and until now, few people outside jihadist circles and the American intelligence community have even known of his existence. “We’ve become numb to what he’s doing,” Tim told me when I first met him. He says they haven’t heard anything from Yahya since 2014, and they hadn’t heard confirmation that he was with the Islamic State until I appeared on their doorstep. “He’s no one I recognize anymore. I’m not looking out for what he’s doing, or how he’s doing, because I’m not sure it makes any difference.” Martha, he said, has taken longer to come to terms with the loss of their son. They don’t think he will return to America—not as long as he has a following in Raqqah, and the certainty of incarceration in the United States. Tania and the kids lived with them for a long period after her return, but she now resides separately. The kids stay with their grandparents during the week and their mother on weekends. Having spent most of the past decade as an itinerant jihadist, Tania lacks the job skills and degrees to match her intellect, so she does not have the resources or career prospects to raise four young children on her own. The kids will grow up in Plano, their safety and education financed by their father’s abandoned inheritance. The Islamic State’s enemies are drawing closer to Yahya, from all sides and from above. Drones assassinate his brethren every few days, and there is reason to believe they will kill him too if they get the chance. The U.S. government’s “kill list,” which once included the Yemeni American jihadist Anwar al-Aulaqi, likely now includes John Thomas Georgelas, if his name hasn’t been crossed off already by the time this article reaches readers. Whatever parenting flaws Tim may have had could not possibly merit the anguish he and his wife have suffered. He still seems to think of his son as “John,” a wayward kid, easily influenced by his more assertive elders. “This is the first time in his life where he’s in a position where he might be emulated,” Tim told me. I wanted to tell Tim and Martha that Yahya had been emulated for years, and their inability to see jihadism as a valid subject of intellectual expertise had kept them from realizing it. They didn’t know how evil their son had become, or how coolly competent. Like other parents of jihadists, they saw him as they wished to see him—as the youngster who bumbled through classes, sneaked spliffs, and struggled to hold down jobs. There was comfort in imagining that he remained hapless, and perhaps that his Islam was just another phase. They would be more troubled by the truth—which was that their son, a failure in so many prior pursuits, had found his calling.

Skies over Moscow turn red as Russia concludes 72nd Victory Day celebration with a massive fireworks display to mark the defeat of Hitler

Huge Victory Day military parade in Moscow involves 10,000 troops and more than 100 units of equipment

Russian President Vladimir Putin was in attendance as well as former Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev

previously predicted rain halted by ‘spiking clouds’ with chemicals to stop rain.

Thousands of Muscovites stood outside last night to witness a massive fireworks display to commemorate the 72nd anniversary of the defeat of Nazism.

Earlier in the day, Vladimir Putin warned the world his Russian army can ‘repel any potential aggression’ after 10,000 troops marched through Red Square with a terrifying arsenal of missiles in a military parade.

The annual march in Moscow marks the defeat of Hitler in the Second World War, but the Russian president was using it today to showcase the Kremlin’s modern military might.

Putin was personally taking the salute at the parade involving 10,000 troops and 114 units of military equipment.

‘And [we will] strengthen the traditions of patriotism, loyally serving the homeland.

‘The lessons of the past war force us to be vigilant and the Russian Armed Forces are ready to repel any potential attack.’

He vowed: ‘There was no, there is no and there will be no force that could ever enslave our people.

‘They fought to the bitter end, defending their homeland, and did what seemed impossible, they turned the bloody wheel of the Second World War back, drove the enemy from our land where it dared to come, crushed Nazism, put an end to its atrocities.

‘And we will never forget that it was our fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers who brought the freedom to Europe and the long-awaited peace on the planet.’

The display of military might used by the Moscow-backed insurgents in their three-year conflict against government forces violated the terms of a long-ignored 2015 peace deal.

Donetsk straddles a demarcation line in the industrial east of Ukraine from which both sides’ big guns were meant to have been withdrawn almost two years ago.

An AFP reporter counted 45 pieces of heavy military equipment – ranging from a lone World War II-era tank to its modern versions used in the current war as well as rocket launchers and anti-aircraft guns – roll through the city’s main street.

Donetsk separatist leader Alexander Zakharchenko led a march of about 1,000 fighters who held up a long banner painted the black and orange colours of Russia’s patriotic Saint George’s ribbon.

Zakharchenko told the crowd that May 9 ‘is the holiest day for us all’.

On the other side of the frontline Ukrainian authorities have joined European nations in marking the end of World War II on May 8 after its 2014 pro-EU revolution. The decision was meant to underscore Ukraine’s split with Russia and embrace of the West.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko told a group of soldiers on Tuesday that ‘we will no longer celebrate this holiday along the Russian scenario.’

But several hundred people carrying photographs of relatives who fought in what the Soviet Union called ‘The Great Patriotic War’ still marched through Kiev on Tuesday.

Donald Trump wasn’t thinking about running for President in 1984, but his heart was in the right place for one young boy’s struggle with HIV and AIDS.

Ryan White was infected with HIV when he was only 13 years old. He had hemophilia, a blood-clotting disease that meant he needed to get blood transfusions all through his childhood. In the 1980s, HIV was a new disease and no one yet knew to screen donated blood. Ryan White was one of the first people in the US to talk openly about having HIV and became famous in the US and all over the world. He bravely fought to educate others about HIV and against the stigma and discrimination HIV-positive people often face.

In 1984, Ryan’s high school in Kokomo, Indiana, learned about his status. They refused to let him return to the school for fear that he would infect other students. Ryan was only allowed to participate in classroom activities by telephone. His family fought the superintendent’s decision in court and Ryan was able to return to school after a judge ruled in his favor. He was tormented when he returned to school. Students frequently insulted him and wrote degrading statements on his locker. His family faced discrimination as well. Store clerks refused to hand his mother change because they didn’t want to touch her. Restaurants threw away plates and silverware after the White family ate there. Someone even fired a gun into a window of the family’s home.

Watch Hillary’s views on this, and her strange accent:

In 1987 the Whites moved to Cicero, Indiana, so Ryan could attend a school that would not discriminate against him. Instead, the school board held conferences for parents and students to educate the community about HIV/AIDS and to encourage compassion rather than fear and discrimination. A student at Ryan’s new high school later said, “When he first came a lot of people were really scared, but Ryan helped all of us to understand.” In 1988, Ryan spoke at the President’s Commission on AIDS. “Because of the lack of education on AIDS, discrimination, fear, panic, and lies surrounded me. I was labeled a troublemaker, my mom an unfit mother, and I was not welcome anywhere. People would get up and leave so they would not have to sit anywhere near me. Even at church, people would not shake my hand. This brought on the news media, TV crews, interviews, and numerous public appearances. I became known as the AIDS boy. I received thousands of letters of support from all around the world, all because I wanted to go to school.”

Ryan became very ill during his senior year of high school. Celebrities and public figures, including Vice President Dan Quayle, President George H.W. Bush, Donald Trump, Michael Jackson, and Elton John, called while Ryan was in the hospital to wish him well. At this time, though, doctors knew very little about how to treat HIV. Ryan died on April 8, 1990, surrounded by his mother, grandparents, and Elton John. Even in death Ryan could not escape the hatred and discrimination; his gravesite was vandalized four times in the following two years.

Ryan’s story was told in many newspapers, magazines, and television shows, and a TV movie was made about his life. His courage and openness started the conversation about HIV and the prejudice HIV-positive people face. At a time when HIV was called a gay disease or a drug addict’s disease, Ryan would say, “I’m just like everyone else with AIDS, no matter how I got it.”

Trump and Michael Jackson visited the boy frequently and Donald paid for his health treatments via his exclusive jets.

In 2009 Golf legend Arnold Palmer invited some very special guests to tour his Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children and Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women & Babies last week.

The 79-year-old was joined by Donald Trump, Chairman and CEO of the Trump Organization, and Stewart Rahr – President and CEO of Kinray Inc – for the tour, and the pair surprised the philanthropic golfer by presenting him with a donation for $350,000.

Donald Trump is said to have been so touched by the tour and a boy in need of emergency open heart surgery, that The Donald immediately spoke with his friend Stewart Rahr and the duo decided to make the large donation.

The tour took the men through Arnold Palmer Hospital’s atrium, pediatric emergency department and trauma center, pediatric intensive care unit, and playroom in the acute care unit, and through the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Winnie Palmer Hospital. They stopped frequently to offer encouraging words to the medical staff and to spend time with patients.



The boy, who was not named for privacy and HIPPA concerns, is said to be fine and well today, and is said to be voting for Donald in Orlando where he’s from.

Meanwhile, voters are getting wary of Hillary’s pandering: Watch this shocking video of her statements:

Arnold Palmer founded both the Arnold Palmer Pavilion at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando, Florida. The Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children is a world-class medical facility, which was originally known as the “Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children and Women.” In 2006 a new campus was built adjacent to the original building, the Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies, named after his wife Winnie, creating separate pediatric and obstetrics hospitals. Fundraising for the hospitals is carried out through the Arnold Palmer Foundation .

Donald Trump is a brilliant man. His taking back of the White House for the American people against the world globalists proved that. And now liberals are having a freak out of epic proportions because Trump just picked his first three transition team members, and its brilliant.

Trump was an anamoly in the corporate world when he would take female talent potential to run his hotels and companies. While the rest of NYC’s business leaders stuck with the traditional male hiarchy, Trump broke ground multiple times when he saw talent that reached across gender lines. Now it’s apparent his white house team will be no different. His first pick is a woman who made history as the first female to successfully run a presidential campaign, against a vicious media at that.

Kellyanne Conway was named Donald Trump’s campaign manager Aug. 17, making her the first woman to ever run a Republican presidential campaign. She’s traveled with Trump throughout his campaign in its last months and advised him, as well as appeared frequently on TV to speak on his behalf.

Bikers arrive in DC: will you be there?

Conway, 49, is a veteran political operative, who’s spent the last three decades advising Republicans on how to appeal to female voters. In fact, she was already doing this for the Trump campaign before he tapped her to be his campaign manager.

Conway graduated magna cum laude from Trinity College in Washington, D.C., earning a degree in political science.

Conway met Trump in 2006, when she was living in one of his buildings, according to the Washington Post. She even served on the condo board of the Trump World Tower in Manhattan. Trump, she told the Post, was surprisingly hands on, even showing up to meetings to hear residents’ concerns. Over the years, the Post continued, Trump would call her to say he’d seen her on TV and ask her opinion on a topic.

Trump’s second pick is none other than billionaire innovator Peter thiel, a gay Republican and business genius. Peter, an immigrant from Austria, helped create PayPal, then using the money to invest and fund ideas he saw as having potent l to shape the future. He invested in a young Facebook when he so it’s potential, and we all see how that turned out.



Peter is going to be perfect for bringing the outside insight trump needs to restart American industry.

The third pick needs no introduction. Growing up a poor African American in inner city Detroit to becoming the surgeon to personally perform the first fully successful conjoined twin separation at age 35, doctor Ben Carson is just the doctor we need to solve America’s Healthcare crisis. And Donald Trump has tapped him as his number three.

Benjamin Solomon Carson was born in Detroit, Michigan, on September 18, 1951, the second son of Sonya and Robert Solomon Carson. His mother was raised in Tennessee in a very large family and dropped out of school in the third grade. With limited prospects in life, she married Baptist minister and factory worker Robert Carson when she was 13. The couple moved to Detroit and had two children. But Sonya eventually discovered her husband was a bigamist and had another secret family. The two divorced, with Robert going to live with his other family and thus leaving Sonya and her children financially devastated.

Ben was 8 and Curtis, his brother, was 10 when Sonya began to raise them as a single mother, reportedly moving to Boston to live with her sister for a time and eventually returning to Detroit. The family was very poor and to make ends meet Sonya sometimes toiled at two or three jobs simultaneously in order to provide for her boys. Most of the jobs she had was as a domestic worker.As Carson later detailed in his autobiography, his mother was frugal with the family’s finances, cleaning and patching clothes from the Goodwill in order to dress the boys. The family would also go to local farmers and offer to pick vegetables in exchange for a portion of the yield. Sonya would then can the produce for the kids’ meals. Her actions, and the way she managed the family, proved to be a tremendous influence on Ben and Curtis.Sonya also taught her boys that anything was possible. By his recollection many years later, Carson had thoughts of a career in medicine. Because his family was on medical assistance, they would have to wait for hours to be seen by one of the interns at hospitals in Boston or Detroit. Ben would listen to the pulse of the hospital as doctors and nurses went about their routines, fantasizing that one day they’d be calling for a “Dr. Carson.”

ALBANY- Plagued by sky-high taxes, the coldest winters, the largest continuous loss of residents of any region in America, and the percentage of residents on some sort of government assistance or subsidy to survive, Upstate New York was ranked by a leading journal in Albany the worst place in America to live.

“The poverty and unemployment rate among millennials is at almost 30%. Most people can barely afford to pay their bills in the harsh winters. The economy dries up when all the folks with money leave Upstate New York in the summer. It’s just a bad place to be right now.” Said journal President Ricky Bohl.

Sure enough, only last year it was predicted that for the first time in American history, Florida would surpass New York State in population. The results of the mass exodus of residents from Upstate can be seen in many of the vacant and rundown mill towns across the state.

A recent study by Business Insider found that 2 out of 5 of the most depressed cities in America are also located in Upstate New York. The newest findings by the Journal only confirm what’s long been suspected.

One millennial who was a candidate in a local race for office in Upstate New York wasn’t even allowed to participate after his signatures were challenged for ballot access. Al Thoma was running for school board in Albany when a 6o+ year old woman who he has never heard of challenged his petitions. When asked about the New York State Election System, Al said, “What system? You mean the Lineal succession of democratic oppression? How it’s fixed against independents…”

FREE TRADE DEALS GUTTED NYS:

Since 1989, the average income for a person living in upstate New York has plummeted $6,000 AFTER inflation. Manufacturing jobs are leaving, as a result of NAFTA and other “deals” that have enriched businesses but left New Yorkers without any income or job.

The journal also found that over 50% of millennial candidates for office in Upstate New York are excluded from running after local election boards disqualify them for technicalities. This has contributed to a large brain drain from the region as millennials not only have no jobs or hope for an adult future, but are denied from participating in their communities. So the answer for them? They are leaving.

In the last decade, the total number given is about 1.6 million people. If not for New York City’s huge influx of foreign immigrants, the population would be dropping rather than just staying stagnant.

The biggest problem here is that while the young people are leaving, it’s leaving an aging population stuck to clean up the mess they created. New York home owners regularly face the highest tax burden in the country. If not for New York City’s constant young population moving in as others move out, the state would be in a state of social security emergency.

When it’s not electoral suppression or freezing cold winters 8 months at a stretch, it’s police brutality that is causing discord.

New York’s one system rule has led to some of the worst cronyism in the country for local governments and police forces. The most known is that of the son of a police commander in Upstate New York who beat and abused his teenage girlfriend for years in his hometown with impunity. When neighbors or the girl’s mother called police to the house over due to screams or statements to her family of abuse, the police officers would talk to the Commander’s son and then call his father. This went on for years even escalating to a swat standoff after the son burned the girl with cigarettes and put a gun to her head while she was on the phone with her mom.

After the three hour standoff, which was downplayed by the local media, the son was transported to a local psychiatric center where he was monitored for 24 hours for possible suicidal thoughts. After being released, he went back to his apartment, where he beat the girl for getting the police and his father there in the first place.

A recent collection of photos by photographer Brenda Kenneally titled “Upstate Girls” highlights the gripping poverty of Upstate. Brenda asked a 14 year old pregnant teenager if she could photograph her over the course of her pregnancy in 2003. After the girl said yes, what came next was ten years of cataloging the poverty that surrounded the girl’s life. The photos made it into the New York Times, causing outrage across the internet over certain behaviors of those being photographed.

Upstate New York is likely to remain on the list of the worst region in America to live in for some time. Food prices are higher than the national average, gas is among the highest in the country, and income tax remains the worst. All of these and a surplus of citizens looking for jobs, with a limited amount available in the state, keeps employers from having to remain competitive with salaries and benefits. The current system has no signs of changing either. The voters who own homes in New York, while under constant strain, don’t know anything different and thus show no signs to call for change. Since they don’t realize how broken everything is in the first place, the exodus of people and wealth will continue unabated.

According to the website howmoneywalks.com, using data of how money travels out of certain states and into others using IRS records of income migration, New York has lost over $80 billion dollars since 1993. This alarming trend is only getting worse every year.

Within 50 years things could change. Regions are always fluctuating up and down in prosperity. But for now, the Journal concludes that Upstate New York is the worst place one can live.

Why?

Acid attacks in Britain’s capital are soaring to new heights, new data reveals.

A Freedom of Information request submitted by the Mirror shows that between 2011 and 2016, London had nearly 1,500 cases of the devastating crime, which burns the skin and leaves victims cowering from their injuries.

In the long term, the scale of the injuries are so scarring that victims can often suffer serious psychological damage as a result of the attacks.

Last year alone, there were 431 such acid attacks – a rise of 170 cases from the year prior.

The figures match a general UK trend, in which the crime rate for such attacks has risen by 50% since 2005.

Acid attacks in London boroughs Newham – 398 Barking & Dagenham – 134 Tower Hamlets – 84 Havering – 81 Redbridge – 64 Hackney – 45 Barnet – 44 Croydon – 42 Ealing – 40 Hillingdon – 36 Islington – 34 Hounslow – 31 Hammersmith & Fulham – 30 Brent – 30 Waltham Forest – 29 Greenwich 28 Harrow – 27 Lewisham – 27 Sutton – 27 Richmond-upon-Thames – 25 Enfield – 26 Southwark – 24 Westminster – 24 Camden – 24 Bromley – 19 Merton – 19 Haringey – 18 Bexley – 17 Wandsworth – 17 Kingston upon Thames – 16 Lambeth – 15 Kensington & Chelsea – 15 Source: Trinity Mirror Most popular: Woman, 48, dies in Scottish Mighty Deerstalker cross-country race

Globally, roughly 80% of victims tend to women. Attacks are often carried out by vengeful men who have had their marriage proposals or sexual advances rebuffed.

However, acid attack charities in the UK estimate that British victims are predominantly men, at roughly 71% of victims.

Jaf Shah, the executive director of the support group Acid Survivors Trust International (ASTI), told the Guardian: “Looking at the data in general, there is a fairly large probability that a high percentage of the incidents are male-on-male attacks and most likely to be gang-related.

“The numbers appear to be very high and suggest an increase, which is very concerning.”

A former gang member described how acid attacks had become more acceptable and were not seen as a “big deal”.

“People don’t think of the consequences,” he said. “It’s easy to buy most of the ingredients legally…One of my cousins was done a few years ago. He was attacked on his shoulder and my uncle just dressed it for him at home.

“Acid is used as an extreme mark of dominance. It’s letting the individual know I haven’t killed you, but it’s almost worse than that, it’s a mark – on your face. It’s a sinister legacy.”

The difficulty and emotional trauma in reporting acid attacks can also mean that the figures are severely underinflated.

Newham, in east London, had the highest instances of acid attacks with 398 in the last six years.

Melania Trump, the beautiful wife of President Trump, isn’t just a beautiful model that is a great role model to young women, but she is also the smartest.

Melania Trump speaks a shocking 5 languages. That’s 4 more than Michelle Obama, and 2 more than Jacky Kennedy, who used her knowledge of French and Italian to help JFK negotiate with leaders across the Globe.

Melania knows Serbian, Slovenian, German, French, and English. She knows a bit of a lot of different languages.

From the Week:

She grew up in communist Yugoslavia and speaks five languages

Slovene, English, French, Serbian and German, if you want to know. That linguistic prowess could come in handy at White House functions, but it has been suggested her thick accent is the reason she makes few public speeches alongside her immigrant-bashing husband.

Melania was raised away from the glamour of New York high society in a concrete tower block in then Yugoslavia during the rule of Marshal Josip Tito. Now that her husband has become president, Melania is the first first lady to be born in a communist nation and only the second to be born abroad, after Louisa Adams, the English wife of sixth president John Quincy, who served from 1825 to 1829.

Her native Slovenia wants to help the US’s relationship with Russia

Melania’s home country appears to believe her rise to the White House could be an opportunity to increase its own standing in the world. Tiny Slovenia, with its population of two million, has positioned itself as a possible mediator between the US and Russia.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, who rarely makes trips to western states, has visited Slovenia twice and the two nations have a comfortable relationship with one another.

Prime Minister Miro Cerar told the Associated Press last year: “If the United States and Russia give some initiative in this way, Slovenia could become a bridge between the two powers.”

Donald’s apparent soft spot for Russia may mean Slovenia’s services are not required. However, Cerar said he had spoken to Melania in a phone call following the Trump election victory, both chatting in their native tongue.

Intel scholars have proven her IQ is the highest based on her self made fortune and her knowledge of many languages.

She’s also the best looking first lady in history.

If you’ve logged on Facebook in the past month, aside from liberals crying, you’d have seen the question “Which Tank fills first?”

A plumber spoke out, and scientists agree.

But first, why is it so popular, and why does nobody agree.

Psychologists have the answer:

Slate:

So, did you get 1 or 9? We’ll get to the “correct” answer in a moment.

But first, why do we get so riled up about these problems? People don’t usually get into fistfights at the bar over arithmetic, but these math threads are spectacularly vitriolic. A couple of factors are at work in these math debates, according to Robert Glenn Howard, a social psychologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison who specializes in Internet communication and folklore. For one thing, the whole point of Facebook and other forums is to provide a place for discourse and debate. Yes, there are your cousin’s new-baby pictures, and the opportunity to stalk a crush, but really, people go to social sites to say stuff. And argue about it. “People are already primed to engage in pretty intense deliberations, and that can bleed over into the way they play games,” Howard says. And that’s exactly what these problems are: games. “Humans have used riddles as a form of play since ancient times,” Howard says. “And sometimes people can get competitive and wrapped up in it.” People use puzzles to show off their smarts, make others feel subordinate, and enjoy telling the story of the game later (as I’m doing right now).

Of course, the fervor with which some people debate basic arithmetic may be a proxy: There’s less at stake in a math debate than a potentially friendship-ending political debate. Arguing over multiplication may even be a way to make a subtle political point, using others’ “wrong” answers to reinforce a broader worldview, such as that the United States has poor math education.

THE ANSWER

Tank 3 will be the the first to mostly fill. Tank 4 won’t start to fill until tank 3 is full to the level of pipe that enters 4. Nonetheless, tanks 3 and 4 will overflow simultaneously because their top edges are aligned, and are lower than either of the other two tanks. So the answer is 3 and 4 together.

It would be a fun experiment to recreate using e.g. paper cups, straws, and tape.

However, they have missed out on a very important fact regarding immigration.

According to our source Angry Patriot Movement, the Democrats have been using the fact that immigrants are part of what built this country, as an excuse to attack our president’s plans to lower the chance of illegal entering in the United States. But, as I said before the have failed to take into consideration that today’s illegal immigrants are very different from the founders of this state.

Recently, the state of Arizona reported that the Muslim refugees that have entered this country, seeking shelter and help have changed the focus of their immigration. Instead of seeking refuges, Muslim refugees are now focusing on wealth. As the Phoenix New Times informed us, after the U.S. terminated every beneficial income for the migrants who are willingly unemployed, they have been fleeing the state of Arizona.

While former President Barrack Obama was still in the White House, Somali refugees have been greeted warmly in this country, and every state had no choice but to accept them and threat them as they were new residents. Every single one of those refugees even received a sum of 925 dollars of taxpayer money.

When the federal funds were terminated, the state of Arizona refused continue the payment. In order to continue receiving financial support, the refugees would have to start learning the English language and find work. You know, like a normal U.S. citizen. But no, instead of trying to improve their life, seek employment and learn the native country’s native language, they would rather flee. Moronic.

Knowing the English language and attempting to financially support yourself and your family is something that every U.S. citizen has to do. What makes the refugees any different? It seems that the liberals have forgotten what the real purpose behind accepting refugees was. To shelter them and help protect them. The rest is up to them. The majority of the refugees are more than capable to learn, work and try and provide food and water for themselves and their families. That is not our job.

This island has been struggling over the past few years from terrible erosion, and it will affect its long-term habitability if it continues at the 15 ft per year.

James Eskridge is the mayor of this small town and he requested for a call during an interview with CNN. According to Liberty Writers, he said:

“Donald Trump, if you see this, whatever you can do, we welcome any help you can give us,” continuing with “I love Trump as much as any family member I got.”

James Eskridge was not expecting to hear from President Trump at all but our president wants to make this country great again and this is just one more step towards it. Eskridge’s phone rang just few days later with the call from Donald Trump. Mr. Eskridge spent a good amount of time on the phone with President Trump and said that Trump shares the same concerns. According to Liberty Writers, he said the following about the call with Trump:

“He said [the erosion] is a problem, and maybe when I’m up in Washington, I could come by and we could chat about it. He’s for cutting regulations and the time it takes to study a project. Of course you need the studies, but we’ve been studied to death.”

Eskridge is grateful for the call can help him with this problem. This is such an amazing story from our president. He shows that he cares about every citizen in this country, even the ones in the smallest cities. I wonder if any other president would do the same. This is just another step to making our country great again! I’m glad to see Trump being our president.

You would think on the heals of his improbable and surprisingly strong run for president, Bernie Sanders would be basking in his newfound clout and fame.

Instead, his wife is under investigation for fraud after she lied to investors, stole a few million dollars and managed to get the college she ran shut down…an investigation that he is being probed in as well.

On top of that, Sanders, technically an independent socialist, not a Democrat, is the target of both the Democrat establishment for damaging Hillary Clinton (like she needed any help with that) and the left-wing crazies that thinks he is a crass, disingenuous fraud living a life of luxury while those represents continue to suffer under the fascist heal of the boot of the blah, blah, blah.

It’s actually this group that is now the bigger thorn in his side. They just decided to kick him out of the Senate!

Local news site Seven Days Vermont picks up the story…

Svitavsky, who calls himself “a bona fide, strong, left-wing Christian liberal,” says he shares many of Sanders’ political views — if anything, he adds, “I’m more liberal than Bernie” — but he is no fan of Sanders’ conduct, calling him “a vicious politician. So many good words, but so arrogant.”

Svitavsky says he was spurred to enter the political arena by the 2016 presidential campaign. “Bernie was very much responsible for Trump’s election,” he asserts. “I was amazed that Sanders wouldn’t do all that he could, once Hillary [Clinton] got the nomination, to elect Hillary over Trump, who would destroy all the things he supposedly believes in.”

Apparently Trump Derangement Syndrome is now causing the left to eat itself.

Massive Fraud Just Uncovered, After 3 Year Investigation Washington Drops Fraud Bombshell On Obama – You’ll Cheer",[],"We will concede that some administration programs start with great goals. Be that as it may, somewhere close to the time some official gets a thought, and the thing gets gone into law and afterward implemented, things frequently turn out badly. This is halfway because of the way that, dissimilar to a business, the legislature is not required or even anticipated that would turn a benefit on its projects. Thus, the inspiration to proficiency goes out the window and is as often as possible replaced by waste and fraud.

This happens a lot with welfare programs as the possibility that it is great to ensure that individuals don’t starve to death changes into a creature that does that, as well as gets mishandled as welfare cheats discover approaches to drain the system for benefits long ways past those to which they are entitled. This heartbreaking situation is rehashed again and again, as citizens’ cash winds up financing fraud.

The Obamaphone program is a terrific case of an administration program gone awful. What began as an arrangement to ensure everybody approached a phone to summon crisis help transformed into years of fraud and abuse.

“A new report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reveals that the infamous” Obamaphone “program, meant to provide low-income Americans phone and internet service, is riddled with waste, fraud and abuse.

“GAO investigators sampled the program’s population and found that they had paid for nearly 6,400 phones for people whom the government has listed as deceased; Another 5,500 people were enrolled for two phones, and another group of people could not prove that they were eligible to receive their free phone. “

How does the administration figure out how to pay for telephones for dead individuals? Plainly those controlling this program are finished incompetents, or simply couldn’t care less about doing their occupation. Such is the issue with government laborers when they are hard to flame, and their adequacy and the viability of the projects on which they work are not assessed or inspected.

“Originally conceived during the Reagan administration, Lifeline was originally meant to provide poor people with a phone in case of an emergency or, as time went on, to apply for a job.”

So there’s the great goal. What’s more, as the hypothesis goes, if these individuals really landed a position, they would drop off the moves for a free telephone and begin paying assessments, so the program should pay for itself after some time. Hasn’t played out as expected by any means, be that as it may.

“The three-year GAO investigation found that the program has put away more than ‘$ 9 billion, as of September 2016 outside the Department of the Treasury on a private bank account.’

“A spokesman for FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, who had already put the dubious program under review, said the ‘GAO report confirms that waste, fraud and abuse are all too prevalent in the program.’”

Stop right there. “Programs” do not put money anywhere. People do. So who has diverted $ 9 billion into a private bank account? And who owns this private bank account? And how was this accomplished without being detected?

There are more inquiries to be asked, for example, what was a definitive goal of this $9 billion in occupied assets.

It’s extraordinary that the GAO is at work, despite the fact that it appears to have taken them a considerable amount of time to discover this fraud. In any case, citizen cash should be saved, and this misuse of a program should be killed.

What do you think about this? Do not hesitate and write your thoughts in the comment section below.

Breitbart reported that Streisand wrote an article titled “The Fake President” in which she said that “there’s a narcissistic fraud in the White House.” Over the next 1,000 words, the Academy Award winner questions Trump’s mental stability, his willingness to criticize what he calls the “very fake news” media, and his ability to be U.S. president.

“The large ego of a small man drives the vindictiveness of his policies,” Streisand wrote, later adding, “This is the Trump presidency. He will not grow in the office.”

“He watches cable TV and then tweets in a rage,” the singer stated. “He lacks the temperament to fulfill his role. For all his ranting about fake news and fake media … the truth is, he is the fake president.”

Shockingly, the most exceedingly awful conceivable situation happened.

The operation reverse releases when a Border Patrol operator named Brian Terry was killed by a cartel part with one of those weapons. The resulting conceal and muddling by Obama and his operators are presently causing issues down the road for the previous president, as another congressional investigation report is investigating a conceivable charge of “obstruction of Congress.”

Via Conservative Tribune:

Former President Barack Obama may not be in office anymore, but one of his scandals has not yet been laid back, as evidenced by a recent report from Congress.

In a report titled “The Frustration of the Congress by the Department of Justice,” the House Oversight Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee found fault with the Obama administration’s handling of the scandal that helped arm Mexican drug cartels.

In particular, the report blasted Obama and his Justice Department for “obstruction of the Congress” and was less than coming with the media and victims’ families about what really happened.

When Border Terror agent Brian Terry was killed in a “Fast and Furious” gun during a 2010 firefight with Mexican gang members and the scandal blew up in the Obama administration’s face, the Justice Department was “focused more on spin and obfuscation than getting the facts Right, “the report noted.

Even when Terry’s family sought answers from Obama’s top law enforcement agency, the congressional report found that the DOJ viewed them as nothing more than “public relations displeasure.”

The report was unforgiving in its findings that the Justice Department gave false information to Congress in order to cover up the truth of the sour operation.

What’s most concerned, however, was that the misrepresentations to the Congress came from the very top.

Then-Attorney General Eric Holder, who was found in contempt of Congress in a 2012 vote in the House, has denied “thousands of key documents,” and he even asked Obama to execute his “executive privilege” over “all documents related to Justice Department’s responses to Congressional questions about Fast and Furious. “

Of course, Obama sided with his liberal buddy and “dishonestly” allowed the administration’s refusal to comply with lawful congressional subpoenas in order to “obstruct the investigation.”

“In the course of that investigation, nearly six years ago, the Justice Department wrote to the Congress and falsely denied that law enforcement officers allowed straw purchasers to illegally purchase firearms in the United States and traffic them without being apprehended,” the report explained. “Since that false denial, the Committees have investigated why the Department of Justice misled Congress and failed to correct its misrepresentation in a timely manner.”

Fortunately, whistleblowers came forward with their knowledge of “Fast and Furious,” allowing Congress to piece together a more accurate picture than the fragmented version they received from Obama’s cronies.

Thank goodness for whistleblowers! If they were not for them, who knows what evils could be perpetrated by self-serving politicians.

Thank heavens for informants! If not for them, who realizes what shades of malice could be executed independently from anyone else serving lawmakers.

It is certainly route past time for Barack Obama’s violations to be uncovered for all the world to see. He was and still is, evidently, not disinclined to utilizing even the most criminal intends to accomplish his targets.

It will be intriguing to perceive what Congress’ ultimate conclusion on the issue ends up being and if Obama will be serving any prison time. How about we simply say we trust that justice will be served, as we lost an American life over this stupid operation.

The media is excessively bustling fixating on Trump’s tweets, making it impossible to try and investigate this. Judge rejects co-defendant’s demand to postpone Menendez corruption trial.

A government judge in New Jersey on Thursday rejected a Florida specialist’s motion to defer his and Sen. Weave Menendez’s (D-N.J.) September corruption trial, New Jersey Advance Media detailed.

Lawyers for Dr. Salomon Melgen, an eye specialist who has convicted in a government court in Florida a month ago of 67 tallies of Medicaid fraud, asked U.S. Area Judge William Walls a week ago to postpone his and Menendez’s trial until October…

In the New Jersey federal court case, Melgen and Menendez are confronting corruption accusations, with prosecutors charging that Melgen gave the New Jersey Democrat about $1 million in campaign donations and free treks in return for government-related favors.

Menendez, who has served in the Senate since 2006, has argued not blameworthy for the situation. Dividers beforehand denied asks for by Menendez’s lawyers to postpone the trial until October.

Will Dirty Money Trail Lead Us To Clinton?,[],"Certain names keep popping up in the news with at least some connection to potentially nefarious activities during the last campaign. Given that Hillary Clinton was a candidate, people can be forgiven for assuming the worst. After all, she is not the person to turn to when looking for help in establishing ethical standards for those in government.

We are now about eight months since the presidential election was concluded, and debates continue regarding the alleged interference by the Russians, political maneuvers by the former director of the FBI and attorney general, as well as a bevy of internet-related and hacking allegations. Investigations are ongoing and some may actually produce results, although those results might not be what some were expecting.

John Podesta, Hillary’s campaign manager, has managed to remain in the public spotlight, although it’s not entirely certain that he wishes to. Perhaps he would just like to go back to doing whatever managers of failed presidential campaigns do. That’s not likely to happen in his case as it turns out that it might by Mr. Podesta who had connections to Russian interests and engaged in considerable financial transactions with them. With all the attention the media and Democrats have focused on President Trump, so far to no avail, this could be huge.

The New York Post reports:

“Lawmakers failed to seize on an alarming development in the Russia collusion story last week, one that should spark serious and immediate congressional inquiry.

“But it didn’t involve President Trump or his administration.

“During a heated Fox Business interview with Maria Bartiromo, Hillary Clinton’s former campaign chief John Podesta made a series of misleading statements when questioned about his involvement in a company that received $35 million from the Russian government while Hillary served as secretary of state…

“On Jan. 18, 2011, a small green-energy company named Joule Unlimited announced Podesta’s appointment to its board. Months later, Rusnano, a Kremlin-backed investment fund founded by Vladimir Putin, pumped $35 million into Joule. Serving alongside Podesta on Joule’s board were senior Russian official Anatoly Chubais and oligarch Ruben Vardanyan, who has been appointed by Putin to a Russian economic-modernization council.”

That’s more than just a casual connection to Russian businesses, power-brokers, money, and politicians. Perhaps Mr. Podesta hopes that the word “Russia” just drops out of American vocabulary for a while.

In any event, the following excerpt from this interview will bring into crisp focus the reason he was selected by Hillary has her campaign manager: They both have mastered the art of massaging the facts by making statements that, while technically true, are deliberately misleading.

Observe:

“Bartiromo asked Podesta why he failed to disclose his role in Joule as required by law when he entered the White House in January 2014 to serve as counselor to President Barack Obama.

“‘Maria, that’s not true. I fully disclosed and was completely compliant,’ Podesta shot back.

“But according to his own financial disclosure form, Podesta only listed two of the three entities that made up Joule Unlimited, failing to disclose his presence on the board of the Dutch-registered Stichting Joule Global Foundation.

“When Bartiromo pressed Podesta on the whereabouts of his 75,000 shares of Joule stock, Podesta resorted to Clintonesque semantics: ‘I didn’t have any stock in any Russian company!’

“Notice the rhetorical sleight of tongue there: Joule is based in Massachusetts, not Russia, making Podesta’s statement technically true. Podesta added: ‘And by the way, I divested before I went into the White House.’”

“In short, Clinton’s top campaign chief and a senior counselor to Obama sat on Joule’s board alongside top Russian officials as Putin’s Kremlin-backed investment fund funneled $35 million into Joule. No one looking at the Podesta fact pattern can claim to care about rooting out Russian collusion and not rigorously investigate the tangle of relationships.”

So, to the Democrats and others on the left we ask, do you really want a complete, honest, independent, and thorough investigation into anyone and any influences American that might have touched on Russia in the past election? Or would you prefer just to conduct a witch hunt against President Trump?

Now the war of words has suddenly turned into a firestorm as a new report reveals that there was much more to Comey’s supposed personal notes about meetings with Trump than he told the American people, the media or congress.

Now the President is on the warpath!

It all started with an investigative report and a tweet…

Then the president stepped in and blew it up!

As the day has gone on, we have begun to learn just how much deep water James Comey is in…

More than half of the memos former FBI chief James Comey wrote as personal recollections of his conversations with President Trump about the Russia investigation have been determined to contain classified information, according to interviews with officials familiar with the documents.

This revelation raises the possibility that Comey broke his own agency’s rules and ignored the same security protocol that he publicly criticized Hillary Clinton for in the waning days of the 2016 presidential election.

Hypocrisy much?

Of course the real fun of this is the reaction of the media who once more broadcast fake news and have been once more exposed as the lying fools that Trump has repeatedly made them into.

As for Comey, the media boyscout looks more and more like just another swamp dweller.

It’s spawned a lot of fake news, it’s made Trump look bad, and it’s distracted from the real work that needs to be done to restore this country.

In short, the lie worked. But that story has also diverted focus from Trump’s new nominee. And this guy’s credentials will make you wonder if Trump had a bigger plan in place all along – finally convicting Clinton for her many crimes.

The Conservative Tribune reports:

Failed Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton and her corrupt lackeys should be very nervous about this new FBI nominee — their time skirting the consequences for their questionable actions may be drawing to a close.

The candidate himself? Christopher Wray, an attorney with a ton of law enforcement, leadership, and legal experience. And all of that experience is in one specific area – catching slippery and powerful criminals like Hillary Clinton.

Wray “has worked as a white-collar criminal defense lawyer, [and] also served for a few years in the Department of Justice during former President George W. Bush’s administration as head of the Criminal Division.”

His credentials go on. “…graduate of Yale Law School, clerked for a justice on the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals,” and – in one of the most impressive lists I’ve ever seen –“oversaw efforts to take on corporate fraud and clean up the U.S. financial markets, going after drug traffickers, intellectual property thieves and distributors of child pornography, as well as other white collar crimes.”

Here’s the interesting part – take a good, long look at that list at the end.

Drug traffickers, corporate fraud, associations with child molesters…does this sound like a family we know well?

Because I have one in mind. And they’ve escaped justice for years.

But maybe they won’t with a new man at the helm.

Fact is, James Comey, as talented as he was, never had the strength or the guts to do the most important thing – take down Hillary Clinton. And Trump promised he’d lock her up.

Comey didn’t do so. And then Trump fired Comey, and hired Wray.

However, they have missed out on a very important fact regarding immigration.

According to our source Angry Patriot Movement, the Democrats have been using the fact that immigrants are part of what built this country, as an excuse to attack our president’s plans to lower the chance of illegal entering in the United States. But, as I said before the have failed to take into consideration that today’s illegal immigrants are very different from the founders of this state.

Recently, the state of Arizona reported that the Muslim refugees that have entered this country, seeking shelter and help have changed the focus of their immigration. Instead of seeking refuges, Muslim refugees are now focusing on wealth. As the Phoenix New Times informed us, after the U.S. terminated every beneficial income for the migrants who are willingly unemployed, they have been fleeing the state of Arizona.

While former President Barrack Obama was still in the White House, Somali refugees have been greeted warmly in this country, and every state had no choice but to accept them and threat them as they were new residents. Every single one of those refugees even received a sum of 925 dollars of taxpayer money.

When the federal funds were terminated, the state of Arizona refused continue the payment. In order to continue receiving financial support, the refugees would have to start learning the English language and find work. You know, like a normal U.S. citizen. But no, instead of trying to improve their life, seek employment and learn the native country’s native language, they would rather flee. Moronic.

Knowing the English language and attempting to financially support yourself and your family is something that every U.S. citizen has to do. What makes the refugees any different? It seems that the liberals have forgotten what the real purpose behind accepting refugees was. To shelter them and help protect them. The rest is up to them. The majority of the refugees are more than capable to learn, work and try and provide food and water for themselves and their families. That is not our job.

This island has been struggling over the past few years from terrible erosion, and it will affect its long-term habitability if it continues at the 15 ft per year.

James Eskridge is the mayor of this small town and he requested for a call during an interview with CNN. According to Liberty Writers, he said:

“Donald Trump, if you see this, whatever you can do, we welcome any help you can give us,” continuing with “I love Trump as much as any family member I got.”

James Eskridge was not expecting to hear from President Trump at all but our president wants to make this country great again and this is just one more step towards it. Eskridge’s phone rang just few days later with the call from Donald Trump. Mr. Eskridge spent a good amount of time on the phone with President Trump and said that Trump shares the same concerns. According to Liberty Writers, he said the following about the call with Trump:

“He said [the erosion] is a problem, and maybe when I’m up in Washington, I could come by and we could chat about it. He’s for cutting regulations and the time it takes to study a project. Of course you need the studies, but we’ve been studied to death.”

Eskridge is grateful for the call can help him with this problem. This is such an amazing story from our president. He shows that he cares about every citizen in this country, even the ones in the smallest cities. I wonder if any other president would do the same. This is just another step to making our country great again! I’m glad to see Trump being our president.

You would think on the heals of his improbable and surprisingly strong run for president, Bernie Sanders would be basking in his newfound clout and fame.

Instead, his wife is under investigation for fraud after she lied to investors, stole a few million dollars and managed to get the college she ran shut down…an investigation that he is being probed in as well.

On top of that, Sanders, technically an independent socialist, not a Democrat, is the target of both the Democrat establishment for damaging Hillary Clinton (like she needed any help with that) and the left-wing crazies that thinks he is a crass, disingenuous fraud living a life of luxury while those represents continue to suffer under the fascist heal of the boot of the blah, blah, blah.

It’s actually this group that is now the bigger thorn in his side. They just decided to kick him out of the Senate!

Local news site Seven Days Vermont picks up the story…

Svitavsky, who calls himself “a bona fide, strong, left-wing Christian liberal,” says he shares many of Sanders’ political views — if anything, he adds, “I’m more liberal than Bernie” — but he is no fan of Sanders’ conduct, calling him “a vicious politician. So many good words, but so arrogant.”

Svitavsky says he was spurred to enter the political arena by the 2016 presidential campaign. “Bernie was very much responsible for Trump’s election,” he asserts. “I was amazed that Sanders wouldn’t do all that he could, once Hillary [Clinton] got the nomination, to elect Hillary over Trump, who would destroy all the things he supposedly believes in.”

Apparently Trump Derangement Syndrome is now causing the left to eat itself.

Massive Fraud Just Uncovered, After 3 Year Investigation Washington Drops Fraud Bombshell On Obama – You’ll Cheer",[],"We will concede that some administration programs start with great goals. Be that as it may, somewhere close to the time some official gets a thought, and the thing gets gone into law and afterward implemented, things frequently turn out badly. This is halfway because of the way that, dissimilar to a business, the legislature is not required or even anticipated that would turn a benefit on its projects. Thus, the inspiration to proficiency goes out the window and is as often as possible replaced by waste and fraud.

This happens a lot with welfare programs as the possibility that it is great to ensure that individuals don’t starve to death changes into a creature that does that, as well as gets mishandled as welfare cheats discover approaches to drain the system for benefits long ways past those to which they are entitled. This heartbreaking situation is rehashed again and again, as citizens’ cash winds up financing fraud.

The Obamaphone program is a terrific case of an administration program gone awful. What began as an arrangement to ensure everybody approached a phone to summon crisis help transformed into years of fraud and abuse.

“A new report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reveals that the infamous” Obamaphone “program, meant to provide low-income Americans phone and internet service, is riddled with waste, fraud and abuse.

“GAO investigators sampled the program’s population and found that they had paid for nearly 6,400 phones for people whom the government has listed as deceased; Another 5,500 people were enrolled for two phones, and another group of people could not prove that they were eligible to receive their free phone. “

How does the administration figure out how to pay for telephones for dead individuals? Plainly those controlling this program are finished incompetents, or simply couldn’t care less about doing their occupation. Such is the issue with government laborers when they are hard to flame, and their adequacy and the viability of the projects on which they work are not assessed or inspected.

“Originally conceived during the Reagan administration, Lifeline was originally meant to provide poor people with a phone in case of an emergency or, as time went on, to apply for a job.”

So there’s the great goal. What’s more, as the hypothesis goes, if these individuals really landed a position, they would drop off the moves for a free telephone and begin paying assessments, so the program should pay for itself after some time. Hasn’t played out as expected by any means, be that as it may.

“The three-year GAO investigation found that the program has put away more than ‘$ 9 billion, as of September 2016 outside the Department of the Treasury on a private bank account.’

“A spokesman for FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, who had already put the dubious program under review, said the ‘GAO report confirms that waste, fraud and abuse are all too prevalent in the program.’”

Stop right there. “Programs” do not put money anywhere. People do. So who has diverted $ 9 billion into a private bank account? And who owns this private bank account? And how was this accomplished without being detected?

There are more inquiries to be asked, for example, what was a definitive goal of this $9 billion in occupied assets.

It’s extraordinary that the GAO is at work, despite the fact that it appears to have taken them a considerable amount of time to discover this fraud. In any case, citizen cash should be saved, and this misuse of a program should be killed.

What do you think about this? Do not hesitate and write your thoughts in the comment section below.

Thank you for reading.

“I’ve never seen what I’m seeing in Minnesota at this very moment surrounding the horrific police killing of Justine Damond — an Australian immigrant and yoga instructor who was just weeks away from getting married when she called 911 to report suspicious noises outside of her Minneapolis home,” King wrote. “The police showed up. Justine, in her pajamas, went outside to meet them, but was fatally shot by one of the reporting officers.”

“All of that is textbook police brutality” he wrote, but added that everything about what happened to Diamond “is normal in America – except the demographics.”

“She’s white — a sweet, popular, peaceful, blonde-haired, blue-eyed white woman at that,” he wrote. “The officer who shot her, Mohamed Noor, is from Somalia and a Muslim.”

“Her whiteness,” King said, has “absolutely everything” to do with how the case has been reported.

“Rekia, Jordan, Aiyana, and Akai are automatically out of the running for “most innocent victim” of police brutality because they are black,” he wrote. “They were all outrageously innocent. None of them deserved even a smidgen of police force, but they did not look like Justine Diamond.”"

Maxine Waters, touted as a champion of poor minorities, thinks she’s too good to live among the people she represents. She’d much rather live in a nice neighborhood with white folks!

Her own constituents have nicknamed her “The Poverty Pimp“.

Fox News Channel’s Tucker Carlson talked about Waters’ unusual circumstances. Here’s how she responded:

“The way Carlson talked about it is: What rights does an African-American woman have to do well? The idea of ‘how could she afford that’ is racist, and I just dismiss it.”

Wrong! Carlson wasn’t being racist. It had nothing to do with being African-American. He simply wanted to know how a Congresswoman could afford a multi-million dollar mansion on a salary that couldn’t support it.

A fair question if you ask us!

After the hour long, unscheduled meeting, Lynch directed FBI Director James Comey to refer to the Clinton email investigation as a ‘matter‘.

Sounds fishy, doesn’t it?

According to a report by Breitbart, House Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Andy Biggs of Arizona and Matt Gaetz of Florida are launching a probe into Loretta Lynch’s relationship with the FBI during its investigation of the Hillary Clinton email scandal.

Specifically, the Congressmen want to know more details concerning James Comey’s testimony that Lynch had directed him to referring to the FBI investigation publicly as a ‘matter’ instead of a ‘criminal investigation’.

The three Congressmen have drafted a measure that would ‘compel the production of documents and evidence‘ related to Lynch’s direction.

The measure would also addresss Comey’s leaks of memos about his conversations with President Trump; discussions about immunity with Hillary Clinton staffers caught up in the email scandal; Comey’s decision last July to recommend that Clinton not be charged; Lynch’s meeting with Bill Clinton last June at the airport in Phoenix; as well as any potential collusion between Comey and former FBI Director Robert Mueller, who is now the special counsel investigating the Trump campaign’s connections to Russia.

Basically, the whole nine yards!

Conservative Tribune reports:

This could be what conservatives have been waiting for.

From the time President Donald Trump finished speaking the Oath of Office, the headlines have been announcing allegations about a crime of “Russian collusion” that hasn’t even been established yet.

But if House Republicans get their way, the investigative power of the government might be turned toward events that actually happened – and determining just how badly American laws might actually have been broken — under the Barack Obama White House."

Parmely asked, “Are we crossing a border? I’ve never been asked if I’m a citizen before when I’m traveling down the road.”

The border crossing checkpoint wasn’t exactly at the border. Several areas have a customs and immigration checkpoint a few miles inside the US border. But it doesn’t matter where it is!

“You are required to answer an immigration question,” the Agent said. “You are not required to answer any other questions.”

When asked if she was being detained, she was told, “You are being detained, ma’am.”

Parmely tried to make it into a Social Justice Warrior statement.

“I have a bunch of teacher friends who are sick of their kids being discriminated against,” she said.

“Don, Jr. has displayed exemplary courage and resolve in the face of repeated and unprovoked attacks against his character by the fake news media,” said Huckabee Sanders, who added that President Trump made his decision to bestow the military’s highest combat award upon his son after watching what he perceived to be “unfair” media coverage of a meeting between Trump, Jr. and a Russian lawyer with links to the Kremlin.

A senior White House official who spoke to The Washington Post on condition of anonymity because they share an office with Anthony Scaramucci said President Trump promoted his eldest son to the rank of Lieutenant General moments before the start of the Medal of Honor ceremony. “This was something that was done out of respect for protocols set forth by the Department of the Army,” the official told The Post, adding that while Trump, Jr. was not afforded the powers associated with his new rank, he is expected to serve in an “advising capacity” on future military operations.

“War is always changing; it’s always evolving,” argued retired Air Force colonel David Lenier. “We had the War on Drugs, the War on Terror, and now, in 2017, we have the War on Journalism.” Colonel Lanier, who made a brief appearance on Fox & Friends Monday morning, called Trump’s War on Journalism a legitimate and just war. “I believe his legacy will be largely determined by how well this administration is able to wage the War on Journalism,” the colonel said.

Journalists and members of the media were barred from attending Sunday’s ceremony where President Donald Trump spoke at length about his son’s selfless sacrifices in the War on Journalism. “The American people owe you their gratitude for having the guts to stand up against fake news,” an official quoted President Trump as saying. The official described the ceremony as “reserved”, saying the guest list was limited to select family members, senior White House staff, and prominent Fox News anchor Sean Hannity."

Investigators say that on the morning of July 9, thirty-three year-old Douglas Jones visited a Westchester County Best Buy electronics store where he discovered Mrs. Clinton’s personal Yahoo email account logged into a Dell Inspiron 5000 display computer. Jones, who maintained he was shopping for a new dishwasher, told the FBI he was confident he’d found “the smoking gun.”

“During questioning, Mr. Jones said he planned to drive to Washington to hand-deliver the printed emails to Special Counsel Robert Mueller,” FBI spokesperson John Doggett told reporters on Friday. Doggett said Jones, who is being charged under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and faces one count of Unauthorized Access of a Protected Computer and eleven counts of Obtaining National Security Information, later asked authorities if they could deliver the emails for him.

“I think the simplest explanation here is that Mrs. Clinton forgot to uncheck that box that keeps you logged in on a particular computer,” said Dr. Stuart Barry, who serves as spokesperson for the Clinton family. Speaking to CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Sunday, Dr. Barry dispelled rumors that Mrs. Clinton’s personal email account had remained accessible on the display computer for months on end, saying, “This is something that happened very recently while Hillary was shopping for a paper shredder. She’s one of those people who isn’t particularly tech savvy. It’s a common mistake.”

“Those who are eligible to vote will have received their gilded envelope by now,” an individual involved in the election process confirmed to The Drudge Report on Sunday. The individual, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to interact with the public, said absentee voters have until August 8 to submit their ballots via armed courier.

Handpicked by the Deep State’s Lord Protector Barack Obama, candidates are slated to present their final statements to voters during a special election ceremony at Bohemian Grove campground next week. While candidates’ identities are only available to those who possess a gilded envelope, they are said to be competing for highly sought-after key leadership roles within the Deep State. The 2017 ballot is said to include positions at the Directorate of Natural Disasters, the Directorate of False Flag Operations, and the newly minted Directorate of Digital Influence, all of which require a term of no less than twelve years.

Trump is said to have levitated nearly three feet in the air during an Oval Office prayer session with evangelical leaders on Monday, according to several people who attended the meeting.

The incident, which was broadcast live on Facebook by Florida televangelist Paula White, occurred shortly after 2 p.m. when President Trump, accompanied by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Vice President Mike Pence, convened with a small group of pastors in the Oval Office for a prayer meeting. “[President Trump] was in great spirits, as was the vice president,” recalled Johnnie Moore, a former senior VP at Liberty University. Moore said a similar prayer meeting was held for President Obama but that things were “different” with President Trump.

“As soon as people placed their hands on him and began to pray, his body appeared to rise off the floor,” the faith leader recalled. President Trump, who considers himself Presbyterian, allegedly began to repeat the phrase, “Tibi, magnum innominandum, signa stellarum nigarum et bufoniformis Sadoquae sigillum!” – Latin for, “To you, the great not-to-be-named one, signs of black stars and the seal of the toad-shaped Tsathoggua!” – while his body remained suspended in mid-air.

At the same time, Jared Kushner, who was standing opposite President Trump, unsheathed an antique Russian Khan-Putinjali dagger from his belt and used it to slit the throat of a live pig, spilling blood onto the Oval Office floor. “Jared’s eyes were burning red and he was speaking in tongues,” Jack Graham, pastor of Prestonwood Baptist Church in Plano, Texas, told Fox News. “In all my years, I have never seen anything like that,” said Graham, who added that Vice President Pence turned “paler than usual” and immediately fainted.

Throughout the ordeal, witnesses say the lights flickered sporadically and a stench of feces began to permeate the Oval Office. “I remember thinking that it felt like the room was getting smaller,” recalled senior White House aide Marty Stratton, who said he and others watched in horror as a fiery pentagram scorched itself into the Oval Office rug’s Presidential Seal. Stratton said the event, which lasted “no more than three or four minutes,” ended abruptly. “The lights came back on and everything appeared normal,” he told Real News Right Now.

President Trump, who tried to remain out of the spotlight after his return from Europe last week, invited religious leaders to join him in the Oval Office on Monday following a planned meeting with representatives from the Office of Public Liaison."

Hobbus J.D.', 'Jim Smothers', 'Ferdinand Mecheng', 'Jane Doe']","VERMON, Vt. – The world’s pink cow population could become extinct as early as 2028 and humans are unsurprisingly to blame, according to a new study conducted by the Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy.

A close cousin of the brown cow, pink cows were first discovered in the 1950’s during the rise of nuclear power. “Pink cows are essentially a byproduct of nuclear energy,” explained Dr. Emmett Brown, the study’s lead researcher. “As nuclear power plants began to pop up in rural areas, you had a sizable population of brown dairy cows that, as a result of prolonged exposure to moderate levels of radiation, mutated into pink cows.”

Unlike brown cows which produce chocolate milk, pink cows are known for producing strawberry milk, a refreshing dairy drink which has enjoyed increasing popularity since its inception in the late fifties. “Strawberry milk consumption is the number one driving force behind the coming extinction of the pink cow population,” charged Dr. Brown, who explained that due to the presence of radiation, the process of extracting strawberry milk from pink cows is typically conducted in a highly controlled environment where the risk of radiation exposure is reduced to a minimum.

Scientists say prolonged exposure to radiation, coupled with rigorous milk extraction methods, has reduced the average lifespan of the pink dairy cow to just under three years. “Whereas brown cows will, on average, produce upwards of three hundred fifty-thousand glasses of chocolate milk in their lifetime, pink cows typically produce less than half that amount,” explained Hershel Greene, a dairy farmer in southern Vermont who was one of the first U.S. farmers to capitalize on the strawberry milk industry.

A strong proponent of nuclear power, Greene told Real News Right Now he began selling strawberry milk to Nestlé in 1975 – two years after the nearby Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant became operational. However, since the plant’s closure in December of 2014, Greene said business has taken a hit. “We’re seeing fewer and fewer pink cow births every year,” he said. The solution, according to Greene, is a global proliferation of nuclear power plants. “We as a society need to embrace the benefits of nuclear energy. It is, after all, safer and far more efficient than the alternative,” argued Green. “Otherwise, strawberry milk production as we know it will no longer be sustainable.”"

“Evidence uncovered over the course of our investigation suggests that on the morning of October 26, 2016, Ranger Corey Stuart acted in self-defense when he shot and killed a two year-old black bear cub on the grounds of Shenandoah National Park,” Assistant District Attorney Julian Irving told reporters. At the time of the shooting, Stuart, who is white, told investigators he shot the eighty-pound black bear eleven times with his shotgun when he became “convinced” it was preparing to charge him.

According to court documents, forty-three year-old Corey Stuart, a decorated veteran of the National Park Service, stumbled upon the sleeping black bear cub in a closed section of the park that authorities say is a “hotbed” for illegal drug activity. “We find a lot of city folk up here,” fellow Park Ranger Ronald Smith told Shenandoah Valley News. Ranger Smith, who was among the first to respond to the shooting, said he recovered a plastic bag containing several grams of marijuana a few feet from the black bear.

Percy Thompson, a former animal trainer with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, said that in his experience, black bears are the most difficult to train. “They’ve got a real problem with authority,” the retired ringleader told Real News Right Now. “Used to be, you’d just tap ’em with a cattle prod and they’d fall in line,” explained Thompson, who added that animal rights groups and the “liberal establishment” are to blame for the recent rise in bear-related incidents.

On Monday, PETA spokesperson Alyssa Jones referred to the death of the two year-old black bear at the hands of a white park ranger as “an ongoing epidemic,” saying the animal rights organization is calling on the Department of Interior to launch an independent investigation into the incident. “In the words of renowned animal lover and civil rights activist Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., ‘Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,” Ms. Jones said."

Hobbus J.D.', 'Jim Smothers', 'Ferdinand Mecheng', 'Jane Doe']","VATICAN CITY – Following more than five hundred years of separation, American and European Protestant leaders met with Pope Francis last week to finalize the reunification of the two churches under the Holy See. The historic agreement is the result of a year’s worth of unpublicized talks between Protestant leaders and the Vatican.

Prominent American pastors Joel Osteen and Rick Warren, respectively, as well as Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, were among the Protestant delegation that met with Pope Francis last week. Pastor Warren, founder of Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California, spoke with members of the international press in St. Peter’s Square, saying, “Protestants, as a people, have a long history of heresy. The time for reconciliation is now in order to ensure a full and dogmatic transition into the folds of the Church.”

Moments before meeting with reporters, the entire Protestant delegation, for the first time ever, entered the confessional to take part, individually, in the Sacrament of Penance. “It’s important that we participate in these sacred rituals before asking our congregation to do the same,” Pastor Osteen said, adding that his time in confession was “an immensely moving experience.”

As Protestants around the world make the transition to Catholicism, many are wondering what, exactly, that means for them. “First and foremost we acknowledge the Pope’s infallibility with regard to universal moral declarations, the authority of Church magistrate, faith, and ex cathedra,” said Father Cliff Brogan, a former Protestant pastor who was the first of the delegation to be ordained as a priest at the Vatican. “Secondly, we participate in the sacrament of the Eucharist by accepting the actual body and blood of Christ, an event known as Transubstantiation, at the conclusion of the holy mass.”

As part of their induction into the Catholic faith, all Protestants above the age of fifteen are required to undergo a Catholic Confirmation, one of three sacraments of initiation, out of seven total, which Catholics can receive. “Most, if not all, of us have been baptized,” said Father Brogran. “However, without formal Confirmation, our Protestant baptisms will be null, thus preventing us from entering the Kingdom of Heaven.”

Additionally, during the transition period, American Protestant families whose children attend Sunday School are to receive vouchers allowing them to participate in CCD programs at area Catholic churches.

In a show of support for the reunification under the Holy See, the United Kingdom announced Wednesday that it is taking steps to reunify Northern Ireland with The Republic of Ireland. The government of the UK has acknowledged the stark differences between the two countries, but according to one official, “We are, for the first time, one people, united under the Bishop of Rome, acting together as the bride and servant of Christ.”"

Hobbus J.D.', 'Jim Smothers', 'Ferdinand Mecheng', 'Jane Doe']","NEW YORK, Ny. – Twelve Russian nationals were taken into custody on Thursday after heavily armed FBI agents conducted a pre-dawn raid on a warehouse in Manhattan’s Garment District where authorities say a fake news manufacturing ring has been operating with near impunity for the last eighteen months.

“We’ve struck a major blow to the fake news industry,” announced Special Agent Walter Greenwald during a press conference at the FBI’s Manhattan office. “These despicable individuals have – for months – deliberately manipulated the public’s perception with the sole purpose of turning a profit.” Special Agent Greenwald said the FBI confiscated more than a dozen printing press machines which the suspects used to mass-produce fake newspapers before peddling them on street corners to unsuspecting New Yorkers.

Describing the operation as “highly sophisticated,” authorities said the perpetrators were able to produce thousands of knock-off newspapers per week at a cost of mere pennies, meanwhile netting upwards of $1.50 a pop for the illicit tabloids. “They were making a killing,” explained one law enforcement official who spoke to Real News Right Now on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. Among the mountains of evidence seized during the raid, the official said FBI agents recovered tens of thousands of copies of a multi-page fake news publication titled The New York Toast, a seemingly obvious imitation of the popular and widely circulated New York Post.

However, according to Special Agent Greenwald, the FBI’s discovery of the illegal printing press operation is only the tip of the iceberg. During Tuesday’s press conference, Greenwald produced what appeared to be a freshly printed copy of The Wall Street Journal. “What you’re looking at is a fake newspaper,” explained Greenwald. “It’s not real.” Indeed, the object was in fact a molded slab of plastic which, from a distance, resembled a real newspaper. Greenwald said the counterfeit item was one of nearly a quarter million fabrications that have been seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents over the past month.

Authorities described a disturbing hierarchy in the underground world of fake news where anonymous individuals and organizations – many of whom identify themselves by cryptic pseudonyms or aliases – compete for “likes,” views, and shares. “Those with the most shares reign supreme,” said “Brian,” a former fake news producer who spoke to Real News Right Now on Tuesday. “It’s a cutthroat multi-national enterprise where no news is safe.”

The widespread fake news epidemic, which became especially prolific in the months leading up to the U.S. presidential election, has become an issue of national debate. Under mounting pressure, both Google and Facebook have announced plans to crack down on the spread of fake news."

Hobbus J.D.', 'Jim Smothers', 'Ferdinand Mecheng', 'Jane Doe']","IRVING, Tx. – A Republican lawmaker in Texas is facing scrutiny after he allegedly called Immigration and Customs Enforcement on his sixty-four year-old mother-in-law following a dinner table dispute over immigration policy.

Immigration authorities say State Representative Matt Rinaldi (R-Tx) called the ICE field office in Dallas, Texas, Tuesday night to report a “possible undocumented immigrant” lurking in his backyard. Moments after heavily armed ICE agents, backed by an armored MRAP vehicle, broke down the door of Mr. Rinaldi’s downtown Irving estate, authorities say they quickly learned the alleged undocumented immigrant was actually the congressman’s mother-in-law.

“Based on our initial investigation, we believe an argument about immigration legislation led to a call being placed to the Dallas field office,” a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security told the Dallas Morning News. In a statement to ICE agents obtained by The Washington Post, Mr. Rinaldi stated that his mother-in-law had “berated him in front of the family” over his stance on immigration and pointedly asked what he would do if she were an illegal immigrant. “At that time, the victim became fearful for his safety and removed himself from the situation before contacting ICE,” the report states.

Neighbors say Tuesday night’s episode isn’t the first time Congressman Rinaldi has reported someone to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Brian Miller, a Democrat who lives across the street from Mr. Rinaldi told KDFW, a Dallas-Forth Worth Fox affiliate, that ICE agents raided his home in April. “We were hosting a birthday party for our eleven year-old daughter and they showed up with their guns drawn,” Miller explained, saying he later learned authorities received a tip from “a concerned neighbor” that his home was being used as an MS-13 drug den. Miller spent four days in an immigration detention facility before he was allowed to see an attorney who could prove he was a U.S. citizen.

On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security announced that it will not seek charges against the Republican lawmaker for filing false reports. “Representative Rinaldi is a close friend and a staunch supporter of ICE,” DHS spokesperson Hank Schrader told reporters before adding, “Earlier this week, Mr. Rinaldi assisted ICE in locating and apprehending a veritable swarm of illegal immigrants who had breached the Texas House of Representatives.”"

Hobbus J.D.', 'Jim Smothers', 'Ferdinand Mecheng', 'Jane Doe']","CAMBRIDGE, Ma. – A groundbreaking study conducted by researchers at MIT suggests Americans living in the United States could find themselves outnumbered by illegal immigrants by a staggering ratio of at least two to one within the next ten years unless significant changes are made to U.S. immigration policy.

“If we continue traveling at our current trajectory, we as Americans will soon become a minority in our own country,” warned Dr. Emilio Martinez. Using satellite imagery obtained from the National Reconnaissance Office, Dr. Martinez and his team were able to map the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States over a ten-year period. “What we’ve seen is an incremental increase of twenty-three per cent over the last decade in the flow of undocumented individuals crossing over our southern border.”

The U.S. Census Bureau projects the U.S. population will reach just over 345 million people by 2025. However, according to Dr. Martinez, the current data doesn’t factor in the millions of undocumented persons arriving in the United States each year. “Our models show that if this trend continues, the population of the United States by 2025 will reach approximately 621 million with just under forty-nine per cent consisting of American citizens,” Martinez explained, adding that the data is offset by a 2% margin of error.

In contrast, the population of Mexico, which currently rests at about 126.3 million, is expected to shrink drastically over the next ten years due, in part, to rapidly changing climates and the country’s ongoing internal conflict with violent drug traffickers. “Mexicans -as we’ve seen over the last quarter century – have already begun to emigrate north into the U.S. and Canada,” said Luis Garcia, a third-year statistics major at MIT who serves as an assistant to Dr. Martinez. “These numbers, while relatively small, are expected to rise exponentially over the next four decades.”

Garcia’s data shows that by 2050, a number of Central and South American countries including Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, could see their populations dwindle below 2.5 million. “These people aren’t simply disappearing,” said Garcia. “On the contrary, they’re coming to the United States.”"

Hobbus J.D.', 'Jim Smothers', 'Ferdinand Mecheng', 'Jane Doe']","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Less than a week after withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, President Donald J. Trump has announced the formation of The America Agreement, a climate change denial pact which he hopes to forge with Nicaragua and Syria, the only two countries on earth that did not sign the Paris climate accord.

“Climate change is a hoax, folks. It’s a huge hoax,” declared President Trump, who spoke at length about the alleged conspiracy during a meet and greet with American oil and coal executives on Monday. “Believe me, they don’t tell you this, but the Democrats invented climate change. They invented it so they could take jobs away from hardworking Americans and outsource them to Mexico and China. It’s very sad.”

President Trump, who appears to have modified his initial assessment that China invented global warming “to make U.S. manufacturing jobs non-competitive,” said that countries who decide to enter into The America Agreement will receive a lifetime waiver on taxes associated with imports to the United States. Meanwhile countries that refuse will “end up paying through the roof” on import taxes.

“The president understands that any sort of deal where other countries have the ability to set their own goals is a bad deal for the United States,” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said on Monday. Spicer said the White House has reached out to a handful of world leaders, including Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, to discuss The America Agreement. “I think it’s obvious that the president and Mr. al-Assad don’t see eye to eye on some issues,” Spicer told reporters, continuing, “Having said that, they clearly agree that this so-called issue of climate change is nothing more than smoke and mirrors.”

Nicaragua, which declined to enter the Paris agreement on the grounds that it stopped short of holding nations accountable should they fail to adhere to their own pledges, is unlikely to accept Trump’s terms. However, Press Secretary Spicer said the president is confident countries will “inevitably” abandon the Paris pact once they realize the benefits of The America Agreement.

President Donald Trump, whose decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement last Friday brought stunned reactions from world leaders and business executives alike, sought to further delegitimize climate change, telling Fox News’s Jeanine Pirro that the air conditioning industry is “partially” responsible for the hoax. “Air conditioning makes you believe it’s hotter outside than it really is,” explained Mr. Trump. “Think about that for a minute. If we didn’t have air conditioning, you wouldn’t even notice.”"

Hobbus J.D.', 'Jim Smothers', 'Ferdinand Mecheng', 'Jane Doe']","LANDOVER, Md. – Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder announced today that following the end of the NFL’s regular season, FedEx Field will host some seventy-five thousand Syrian refugees until they can be relocated to other parts of the country. “We’re doing our part for the betterment of humanity,” declared Mr. Snyder during Sunday’s post-game press conference.

The majority of the refugees will be housed in the stadium itself but just over a third, approximately 26,000 people, will live temporarily in “tent cities” set up in the massive parking lot that surrounds FedEx Field. A number of players, including Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins, will be on hand to attend to the daily needs of the refugees. “It gives us something productive to do during the playoffs,” Cousins told ESPN.

About eighty percent of the refugees are former residents of the Syrian city of al-Raqqa. Located along the north bank of the Euphrates, al-Raqqa has become an ISIS stronghold and has subsequently seen some of the heaviest aerial bombardment since the start of the conflict. “It’s nothing like I remember it,” said Mohammed Hussaini, a Syrian lawyer who is among the refugees set to be housed at FedEx Field. “I fear we can never return.”

The other twenty percent or so, according to the Department of State, have been flagged as ‘origins unknown.’ However, State Department officials working in conjunction with FEMA will establish an operations command center in FedEx Field’s Purple Lot where refugees will undergo a ‘vetting process.’

Prince George’s County City Council President Armin Tamzarian told Fox 5 DC, “On behalf of the people of Landover, I’d like to extend a warm welcome to the refugees. We encourage you leave the stadium; branch out and explore all that Landover has to offer.” Councilman Tamzarian touted the Afrik International Food Market as a “must-see” for the Syrian refugees. “If that’s not enough,” Tamzarian continued, “there’s the Value Village Thrift Store and, let’s not forget, Landover Liquors.”

Many in Prince George’s County view the influx of Syrian refugees in a positive light. “Their arrival has real potential to boost our local economy,” said Bryan White, a small business owner. White, who owns a local gun shop, believes the refugees could increase his sales by at least fifty percent in 2016."

Hobbus J.D.', 'Jim Smothers', 'Ferdinand Mecheng', 'Jane Doe']","ARLINGTON, Va. – Thirteen people were killed and another fifty were injured Sunday morning when an M1 Abrams battle tank plowed through the finish line of the 2015 Marine Corps Marathon, making it the first mechanized member of the U.S. Marine Corps to place first in the annual race.

Twenty-nine year old Ben Hurst from Annapolis, Maryland, who participated in the marathon, said the heavily armored Abrams tank passed him shortly after crossing the Key Bridge onto M Street. “I was like ‘what the f***, that’s not fair,'” Hurst told FOX 5 DC. Hurst later said he still supports the troops.

The tank’s operator Lance Corporal Jason Connelly, who suffers from PTSD and incurs frequent blackouts and hallucinations, said the marathon reminded him of Baghdad during the 2003 invasion. “The streets were jam-packed with people,” he said. “At one point I yelled to my crewman, Todd, ‘Man the fifty!’ But then I remembered we’re in Washington, D.C.”

Arlington County police said nine people were killed in Crystal City near 12th Street South and Army Navy Drive when the Abrams tank shelled the Chatpat Truck, a popular Metropolitan-area Indian food truck. Corporal Todd Bennett, who served three consecutive tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, later apologized for the mishap, telling FOX 5 DC he mistook the food truck for “a haji bus.”

Wilson Mosop of Kenya placed second in the marathon, finishing in just under an hour and thirty-seven minutes. Mosop, a second cousin to President Barack Obama, was said to have spent the majority of the race running alongside the M1 Abrams battle tank."

Hobbus J.D.', 'Jim Smothers', 'Ferdinand Mecheng', 'Jane Doe']","NAPLES, Fl. – According to witnesses and employees at the Eagles Lake Golf Club in Naples, George Zimmerman shot a record-breaking 61 on Monday after playing eighteen holes with an unidentified partner. Zimmerman, best known for shooting and killing Trayvon Martin on July 13th, 2013, had reportedly arrived at the public course just after 1 p.m. to request a tee time.

“Being a public facility, we can’t discriminate against our clientele as much as we’d like, in the way a private club can,” Manager Brett Owens told FOX 4 Now. “But after watching him on the green, even I have to admit, the guy is far better with a club than he is with a gun.”

Witnesses say Zimmerman was using Callaway clubs and preferred to walk the course himself rather than rent a cart. “He played very gracefully,” said one golfer who asked to remain anonymous. “Every stroke he took appeared very well thought out. Premeditated, even.”

Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder charges following the shooting death of Trayvon Martin and has made several appearances in the media since then. In May he suffered minor injuries after being shot at by a fellow motorist who was later revealed to be a neighbor that Zimmerman had been involved in a dispute with. “Despite all that’s happened with him in the past, I think he could really go places if he ever wanted to play golf professionally,” Owens said. “He has the potential to become the white Tiger Woods.”"

Hobbus J.D.', 'Jim Smothers', 'Ferdinand Mecheng', 'Jane Doe']","LONOKE, Ar. – A spokesman for the Remington Arms Company, America’s oldest firearms manufacturer, announced Friday that the company, in an effort to appeal to vegans and other health conscious firearms enthusiasts, is rolling a new product line of organic ammunition. “Not only is each individual round created using the highest quality organic material, Remington also buys every component locally,” spokesman Tommy Ross said.

While cheaper than conventional ammunition, Remington’s organic line meets the same quality standards that have governed the company’s ammunition production for nearly two hundred years. “In fact, during field testing, our organic rounds outperformed almost every premium grade round on the market, including our own,” Ross said.

The components, which differenciate Remington’s organic ammunition from its standard product line, are made entirely of organically produced materials. “Even the gunpowder is organic,” Ross said. “The projectile, or bullet, is made from the pit of an avocado. Needless to say, we use organic avocados grown right here in Arkansas.” The shell casing and primer, Ross explained, are made of an ultra-lightweight organic polymer capable of withstanding extreme heat.

Gus Bryant, a retired Marine and Arkansas native, got a chance to test out Remington’s new product. Using a bolt-action Remington 700, Bryant was able to take down a deer at a distance of three hundred yards. “I found the organic rounds overexceeded my expectations,” Bryant said, adding he that he felt better about consuming the venison after using an organic bullet rather than lead.

Remington’s organic rounds are set to hit stores in later this month and are available in a variety of calibers, from .22 LR all the way up to .50 BMG. Additionally, Remington will offer a line of organic home defense hollow-point ammunition priced slightly higher than the standard organic rounds."

Hobbus J.D.', 'Jim Smothers', 'Ferdinand Mecheng', 'Jane Doe']","ZURICH, Ch. – Following the indictment of over fourteen FIFA officials last week by the U.S. Department of Justice, FIFA president Sepp Blatter resigned as head of the organization on Wednesday amid a firestorm of corruption charges. Speculation as to who might take the reigns of the multi-billion dollar international football organization left some wondering if a female president might be able to reverse the organization’s troubled image.

Isha Johansen of Sierra Leone is one of two female football association presidents, a minority among FIFA’s 209 member countries. Johansen spoke to CNN Wednesday about the possibility of leading the organization, saying, “Yes, it would be wonderful wouldn’t it – but I might decide to do something else.” Johansen said she has learned a lot throughout her years of involvement with football but doubts she’ll enter the election. The Sierra Leone native said the office of the presidency is a position that must be earned, adding, “I would hate for people to think I am where I am because I’m a woman.”

Still, the possibility of FIFA’s first ever female president could become a reality; U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who spearheaded the operation to bring down FIFA’s corrupt leadership, has accepted a nomination for candidacy by the United States, England, and Mauritania. In her acceptance speech, Attorney General Lynch said she aims to “Americanize soccer” while bringing a female perspective to the sport. Lynch said under American leadership, FIFA will undergo a vast “re-branding effort that will reflect American values and sportsmanship while maintaining some of the more traditional aspects soccer fans around the world have come to love.”

Among Attorney General Lynch’s list of proposed changes is a plan to increase corporate sponsorship for football, a move that would dramatically increase profits for FIFA. Classified as a non-profit organization, FIFA reaped over $2 billion in profits in 2014 alone. With additional corporate sponsorship, including the implementation of paid advertising during live broadcasts, a move that would lengthen overall airtime and allow athletes the opportunity to take water breaks, experts believe FIFA could double or even quadruple its profits in the coming years. “Should Mrs. Lynch win the election, we could see FIFA surpass the NFL in terms of annual revenue,” CNN’s global economic analyst Paula Caton told Wolf Blitzer Wednesday. The National Football League brings in an estimated $9.5 billion a year, making it the most profitable sports organization on earth.

Additionally, Lynch plans to boost the role played by women in football by creating a worldwide cheerleading league, to be wholly financed and owned by FIFA, with each of its 209 member countries responsible for training and maintaining their respective squads.

Despite ongoing efforts by the Department of Justice to bring a slew of charges, including bribery and racketeering, against corrupt FIFA officials, the United States is offering any country who pledges unwavering support for Attorney General Lynch a guaranteed economic and military aid package valued at $20 billion. Already, a host of nations, including Tunisia, Bahrain, and Zimbabwe, three countries with a long history of human rights violations, have pledged allegiance to Lynch’s bid for the FIFA presidency.

Sepp Blatter, who served as FIFA’s president for seventeen years before announcing his resignation this week, will remain the head of the organization until a new election is held to determine his replacement. The 79 year-old Swiss citizen holds a degree in business and economics from the University of Lausanne. He was elected into office for the first time in 1998 and was later reelected three times, first in 2002, then, unopposed, in May of 2007, and finally, for his now final term in 2011."

Hobbus J.D.', 'Jim Smothers', 'Ferdinand Mecheng', 'Jane Doe']","HOUSTON, Tx. – More than 43,000 worshipers were in attendance at Lakewood Church Saturday evening when Joel Osteen, Lakewood’s Senior Pastor, reportedly levitated nearly ten feet above the stage following the conclusion of his sermon. “People were hysterical,” said Maya Rodriguez, who, like thousands of others in the Houston area, attends weekly services at the nondenominational megachurch.

Witnesses say roughly forty-five minutes into the 7 P.M. service, Pastor Osteen suddenly appeared disoriented before suffering a violent coughing fit. “His forehead and neck were just drenched in sweat,” said Colton Bradshaw, a Houston native, who was seated with his wife in the second row. The events that followed, according to Bradshaw and corroborated by more than a thousand other witnesses, left worshipers feeling perplexed and, in many cases, terrified.

Osteen reportedly fell to his knees on stage while clutching his chest. “We thought he was having a heart attack,” Bradshaw said. It was then that the charismatic pastor outstretched his arms, threw his head back, and violently arched his back. Dozens of cellphone videos taken by parishioners and uploaded to the popular media website YouTube show Pastor Osteen, seemingly in a trance-like state, rise from the stage. Screams and cries of disbelief from the congregation can be heard as Osteen levitates more than nine feet off the ground.

In one of the higher quality videos uploaded to YouTube by user TheChristianBlessing, Osteen can be seen hovering above the stage with his head slumped forward before, as one witness put it, “suddenly awakening.” As Pastor Osteen appears to hang with his arms outstretched in midair, he opens his mouth and, in a deep, commanding voice, says, “I am the Alpha and the Omega.” Then, his body drops “like a rag doll” to the ground where he remains motionless.

Colton Bradshaw’s wife, Karen, along with dozens of other worshipers, fainted during the ordeal and later required medical attention, but Bradshaw himself remained alert throughout the entire spectacle, which lasted less than four minutes. “When he spoke those words from the Book of Revelations,” Bradshaw later recalled, “It wasn’t his voice that spoke them. It was not Pastor Osteen speaking. The sound of that voice reverberated through the stadium. For as long as I live, I’ll never forget it.”

Paramedics arrived at Lakewood Church at 8:05 P.M. and treated Osteen on the scene. The pastor suffered a mild concussion brought by the nearly ten foot free fall to the stage floor but was otherwise unhurt, save for some minor bruising to his forehead. A spokesman for the megachurch told Fox 26 Houston that Mr. Osteen “has no memory of the events that occurred prior to regaining consciousness.”

Doctors and medical staff at the Texas Medical Center on Holcombe Boulevard in Houston were overwhelmed Saturday night as they treated approximately six hundred and fifty people, many of whom were in a state of shock after witnessing the event. Lakewood Church boasts one of the largest congregations in the United States and reaches an estimated 27 million people worldwide each week. In 1999, Joel Osteen replaced his father, John Osteen, who founded the church in 1959, as Senior Pastor."

Hobbus J.D.', 'Jim Smothers', 'Ferdinand Mecheng', 'Jane Doe']","PORTLAND, Or. – Portland’s city council on Wednesday voted 3 to 1 in favor of the Equal Use Act, a new resolution granting individuals who identify as furries the same rights afforded to dogs and their respective owners who frequent popular off-leash areas and dog parks in the greater Portland area.

The decision comes on the heels of a four-day sit-in organized by PDX Furs, a regional furry community based in the Portland metro area, which staged the protest at Portland’s city council offices on Milwaukie Avenue last weekend. “This is a huge victory,” said Bo Kirkman. “Not just for furries here in Portland but furries living all across the United States.”

Bo, a former kindergarten teacher and self-described furry rights advocate, told the Portland Tribune that he identifies as a dog. “It’s one thing to say you can’t bring your cat or your ferret or whatever to the off-leash areas because obviously they’re not dogs. But if I want to go to the park and play with my owner, well as a canine, that should be my right.”

Now, thanks to the City of Portland, Bo and his fellow furries can take advantage of the city’s designated off-leash areas. “Provided they respect and adhere to the posted rules and regulations at our city parks,” said Public Affairs commissioner Dan Saltzman who sits on the city council and voted in favor of the resolution.

According to the City of Portland’s official website, dog park visitors are expected to pick up and dispose of their pet’s waste and are advised to leave sick animals at home. “In an effort to prevent the spread of disease, we ask that owners refrain from allowing their dogs – or furries – drink from standing water,” Saltzman said.

However, not everyone is celebrating the new resolution.. “I think it’s rediculous,” said council-member Amanda Fritz who sits on the Portland Parks Board and voted against the proposal. “We’re allowing people in costumes to frolic about and fornicate to their heart’s content in our public parks.”

Mrs. Fritz may be alone in her sentiments. Portland mayor Charlie Hales told the Daily Journal of Commerce that the Equal Use Act is synonymous with Portland’s unofficial slogan. “Keep Portland weird,” quoted Mayor Hales before adding, “That is precisely what we intend to do.”"

Hobbus J.D.', 'Jim Smothers', 'Ferdinand Mecheng', 'Jane Doe']","GUAYAQUIL, Ec. – Pope Francis kicked off the start of a three-nation trip across South America today with his first mass, with over a million Ecuadorians in attendance, in the coastal city of Guayaquil. Delivering the mass in Spanish, the Pope spoke about the importance of family in modern society, saying, “It needs to be helped and strengthened, lest we lose our proper sense of the services which society as a whole provides.”

During his sermon, Pope Francis announced to Christians around the world that God had called upon him, instructing him “to revise the most sacred of texts, the Ten Commandments.” Given to the Israelites by God himself at Mount Sinai, the Commandments include instructions for worship and list several prohibited practices.

Pope Francis said Christians around the world are “faced with ever-increasing temptations brought on by the evils of modern society.” The Pope said the updated Commandments reflect the changing times and include some minor rewording of the existing rules as well as the addition of two new Commandments.

The Fourth Commandment, which advocates that proper respect be shown towards one’s parents, has been reworded in order to include children raised by same-sex parents. Pope Francis said the Seventh Commandment, prohibiting adultery and, among other things, homosexuality, has been removed entirely, as instructed by God, in order to extend “God’s grace to all His children.”

Addressing the inclusion of the new Commandments, which bring the total number to eleven, Pope Francis praised the rapid growth of technology in the digital age but said “progress comes at a price.” The new Fifth Commandment, which replaces the prohibition of adultery, forbids all aspects of genetic engineering and bans the consumption of genetically modified foods.

Lastly, the Eleventh Commandment disallows personal idolization and the glorification of one’s self over God. Using the Kardashians, a highly publicized celebrity family, as an example, Pope Francis said, “Selfies are an abomination in the eyes of our Lord.”

A spokesman for the Vatican, Father Federico Lombardi, said the Eleven Commandments are currently being etched into marble by an Italian sculptor and, upon completion, will be unveiled to the world in Saint Peter’s Square following an internationally televised mass."

Hobbus J.D.', 'Jim Smothers', 'Ferdinand Mecheng', 'Jane Doe']","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Former reality TV star and American businessman Donald Trump, Jr. was awarded the Medal of Honor during a private ceremony in the Rose Garden last weekend, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced on Monday.

“Don, Jr. has displayed exemplary courage and resolve in the face of repeated and unprovoked attacks against his character by the fake news media,” said Huckabee Sanders, who added that President Trump made his decision to bestow the military’s highest combat award upon his son after watching what he perceived to be “unfair” media coverage of a meeting between Trump, Jr. and a Russian lawyer with links to the Kremlin.

A senior White House official who spoke to The Washington Post on condition of anonymity because they share an office with Anthony Scaramucci said President Trump promoted his eldest son to the rank of Lieutenant General moments before the start of the Medal of Honor ceremony. “This was something that was done out of respect for protocols set forth by the Department of the Army,” the official told The Post, adding that while Trump, Jr. was not afforded the powers associated with his new rank, he is expected to serve in an “advising capacity” on future military operations.

“War is always changing; it’s always evolving,” argued retired Air Force colonel David Lenier. “We had the War on Drugs, the War on Terror, and now, in 2017, we have the War on Journalism.” Colonel Lanier, who made a brief appearance on Fox & Friends Monday morning, called Trump’s War on Journalism a legitimate and just war. “I believe his legacy will be largely determined by how well this administration is able to wage the War on Journalism,” the colonel said.

Journalists and members of the media were barred from attending Sunday’s ceremony where President Donald Trump spoke at length about his son’s selfless sacrifices in the War on Journalism. “The American people owe you their gratitude for having the guts to stand up against fake news,” an official quoted President Trump as saying. The official described the ceremony as “reserved”, saying the guest list was limited to select family members, senior White House staff, and prominent Fox News anchor Sean Hannity."

Hobbus J.D.', 'Jim Smothers', 'Ferdinand Mecheng', 'Jane Doe']","VATICAN CITY – Following more than five hundred years of separation, American and European Protestant leaders met with Pope Francis last week to finalize the reunification of the two churches under the Holy See. The historic agreement is the result of a year’s worth of unpublicized talks between Protestant leaders and the Vatican.

Prominent American pastors Joel Osteen and Rick Warren, respectively, as well as Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, were among the Protestant delegation that met with Pope Francis last week. Pastor Warren, founder of Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California, spoke with members of the international press in St. Peter’s Square, saying, “Protestants, as a people, have a long history of heresy. The time for reconciliation is now in order to ensure a full and dogmatic transition into the folds of the Church.”

Moments before meeting with reporters, the entire Protestant delegation, for the first time ever, entered the confessional to take part, individually, in the Sacrament of Penance. “It’s important that we participate in these sacred rituals before asking our congregation to do the same,” Pastor Osteen said, adding that his time in confession was “an immensely moving experience.”

As Protestants around the world make the transition to Catholicism, many are wondering what, exactly, that means for them. “First and foremost we acknowledge the Pope’s infallibility with regard to universal moral declarations, the authority of Church magistrate, faith, and ex cathedra,” said Father Cliff Brogan, a former Protestant pastor who was the first of the delegation to be ordained as a priest at the Vatican. “Secondly, we participate in the sacrament of the Eucharist by accepting the actual body and blood of Christ, an event known as Transubstantiation, at the conclusion of the holy mass.”

As part of their induction into the Catholic faith, all Protestants above the age of fifteen are required to undergo a Catholic Confirmation, one of three sacraments of initiation, out of seven total, which Catholics can receive. “Most, if not all, of us have been baptized,” said Father Brogran. “However, without formal Confirmation, our Protestant baptisms will be null, thus preventing us from entering the Kingdom of Heaven.”

Additionally, during the transition period, American Protestant families whose children attend Sunday School are to receive vouchers allowing them to participate in CCD programs at area Catholic churches.

In a show of support for the reunification under the Holy See, the United Kingdom announced Wednesday that it is taking steps to reunify Northern Ireland with The Republic of Ireland. The government of the UK has acknowledged the stark differences between the two countries, but according to one official, “We are, for the first time, one people, united under the Bishop of Rome, acting together as the bride and servant of Christ.”"

Hobbus J.D.', 'Jim Smothers', 'Ferdinand Mecheng', 'Jane Doe']","NEW YORK, Ny. – Twelve Russian nationals were taken into custody on Thursday after heavily armed FBI agents conducted a pre-dawn raid on a warehouse in Manhattan’s Garment District where authorities say a fake news manufacturing ring has been operating with near impunity for the last eighteen months.

“We’ve struck a major blow to the fake news industry,” announced Special Agent Walter Greenwald during a press conference at the FBI’s Manhattan office. “These despicable individuals have – for months – deliberately manipulated the public’s perception with the sole purpose of turning a profit.” Special Agent Greenwald said the FBI confiscated more than a dozen printing press machines which the suspects used to mass-produce fake newspapers before peddling them on street corners to unsuspecting New Yorkers.

Describing the operation as “highly sophisticated,” authorities said the perpetrators were able to produce thousands of knock-off newspapers per week at a cost of mere pennies, meanwhile netting upwards of $1.50 a pop for the illicit tabloids. “They were making a killing,” explained one law enforcement official who spoke to Real News Right Now on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. Among the mountains of evidence seized during the raid, the official said FBI agents recovered tens of thousands of copies of a multi-page fake news publication titled The New York Toast, a seemingly obvious imitation of the popular and widely circulated New York Post.

However, according to Special Agent Greenwald, the FBI’s discovery of the illegal printing press operation is only the tip of the iceberg. During Tuesday’s press conference, Greenwald produced what appeared to be a freshly printed copy of The Wall Street Journal. “What you’re looking at is a fake newspaper,” explained Greenwald. “It’s not real.” Indeed, the object was in fact a molded slab of plastic which, from a distance, resembled a real newspaper. Greenwald said the counterfeit item was one of nearly a quarter million fabrications that have been seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents over the past month.

Authorities described a disturbing hierarchy in the underground world of fake news where anonymous individuals and organizations – many of whom identify themselves by cryptic pseudonyms or aliases – compete for “likes,” views, and shares. “Those with the most shares reign supreme,” said “Brian,” a former fake news producer who spoke to Real News Right Now on Tuesday. “It’s a cutthroat multi-national enterprise where no news is safe.”

The widespread fake news epidemic, which became especially prolific in the months leading up to the U.S. presidential election, has become an issue of national debate. Under mounting pressure, both Google and Facebook have announced plans to crack down on the spread of fake news."

Hobbus J.D.', 'Jim Smothers', 'Ferdinand Mecheng', 'Jane Doe']","IRVING, Tx. – A Republican lawmaker in Texas is facing scrutiny after he allegedly called Immigration and Customs Enforcement on his sixty-four year-old mother-in-law following a dinner table dispute over immigration policy.

Immigration authorities say State Representative Matt Rinaldi (R-Tx) called the ICE field office in Dallas, Texas, Tuesday night to report a “possible undocumented immigrant” lurking in his backyard. Moments after heavily armed ICE agents, backed by an armored MRAP vehicle, broke down the door of Mr. Rinaldi’s downtown Irving estate, authorities say they quickly learned the alleged undocumented immigrant was actually the congressman’s mother-in-law.

“Based on our initial investigation, we believe an argument about immigration legislation led to a call being placed to the Dallas field office,” a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security told the Dallas Morning News. In a statement to ICE agents obtained by The Washington Post, Mr. Rinaldi stated that his mother-in-law had “berated him in front of the family” over his stance on immigration and pointedly asked what he would do if she were an illegal immigrant. “At that time, the victim became fearful for his safety and removed himself from the situation before contacting ICE,” the report states.

Neighbors say Tuesday night’s episode isn’t the first time Congressman Rinaldi has reported someone to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Brian Miller, a Democrat who lives across the street from Mr. Rinaldi told KDFW, a Dallas-Forth Worth Fox affiliate, that ICE agents raided his home in April. “We were hosting a birthday party for our eleven year-old daughter and they showed up with their guns drawn,” Miller explained, saying he later learned authorities received a tip from “a concerned neighbor” that his home was being used as an MS-13 drug den. Miller spent four days in an immigration detention facility before he was allowed to see an attorney who could prove he was a U.S. citizen.

On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security announced that it will not seek charges against the Republican lawmaker for filing false reports. “Representative Rinaldi is a close friend and a staunch supporter of ICE,” DHS spokesperson Hank Schrader told reporters before adding, “Earlier this week, Mr. Rinaldi assisted ICE in locating and apprehending a veritable swarm of illegal immigrants who had breached the Texas House of Representatives.”"

Hobbus J.D.', 'Jim Smothers', 'Ferdinand Mecheng', 'Jane Doe']","CAMBRIDGE, Ma. – A groundbreaking study conducted by researchers at MIT suggests Americans living in the United States could find themselves outnumbered by illegal immigrants by a staggering ratio of at least two to one within the next ten years unless significant changes are made to U.S. immigration policy.

“If we continue traveling at our current trajectory, we as Americans will soon become a minority in our own country,” warned Dr. Emilio Martinez. Using satellite imagery obtained from the National Reconnaissance Office, Dr. Martinez and his team were able to map the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States over a ten-year period. “What we’ve seen is an incremental increase of twenty-three per cent over the last decade in the flow of undocumented individuals crossing over our southern border.”

The U.S. Census Bureau projects the U.S. population will reach just over 345 million people by 2025. However, according to Dr. Martinez, the current data doesn’t factor in the millions of undocumented persons arriving in the United States each year. “Our models show that if this trend continues, the population of the United States by 2025 will reach approximately 621 million with just under forty-nine per cent consisting of American citizens,” Martinez explained, adding that the data is offset by a 2% margin of error.

In contrast, the population of Mexico, which currently rests at about 126.3 million, is expected to shrink drastically over the next ten years due, in part, to rapidly changing climates and the country’s ongoing internal conflict with violent drug traffickers. “Mexicans -as we’ve seen over the last quarter century – have already begun to emigrate north into the U.S. and Canada,” said Luis Garcia, a third-year statistics major at MIT who serves as an assistant to Dr. Martinez. “These numbers, while relatively small, are expected to rise exponentially over the next four decades.”

Garcia’s data shows that by 2050, a number of Central and South American countries including Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, could see their populations dwindle below 2.5 million. “These people aren’t simply disappearing,” said Garcia. “On the contrary, they’re coming to the United States.”"

Hobbus J.D.', 'Jim Smothers', 'Ferdinand Mecheng', 'Jane Doe']","WASHINGTON, D.C. – President Donald J. Trump is said to have levitated nearly three feet in the air during an Oval Office prayer session with evangelical leaders on Monday, according to several people who attended the meeting.

The incident, which was broadcast live on Facebook by Florida televangelist Paula White, occurred shortly after 2 p.m. when President Trump, accompanied by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Vice President Mike Pence, convened with a small group of pastors in the Oval Office for a prayer meeting. “[President Trump] was in great spirits, as was the vice president,” recalled Johnnie Moore, a former senior VP at Liberty University. Moore said a similar prayer meeting was held for President Obama but that things were “different” with President Trump.

“As soon as people placed their hands on him and began to pray, his body appeared to rise off the floor,” the faith leader recalled. President Trump, who considers himself Presbyterian, allegedly began to repeat the phrase, “Tibi, magnum innominandum, signa stellarum nigarum et bufoniformis Sadoquae sigillum!” – Latin for, “To you, the great not-to-be-named one, signs of black stars and the seal of the toad-shaped Tsathoggua!” – while his body remained suspended in mid-air.

At the same time, Jared Kushner, who was standing opposite President Trump, unsheathed an antique Russian Khan-Putinjali dagger from his belt and used it to slit the throat of a live pig, spilling blood onto the Oval Office floor. “Jared’s eyes were burning red and he was speaking in tongues,” Jack Graham, pastor of Prestonwood Baptist Church in Plano, Texas, told Fox News. “In all my years, I have never seen anything like that,” said Graham, who added that Vice President Pence turned “paler than usual” and immediately fainted.

Throughout the ordeal, witnesses say the lights flickered sporadically and a stench of feces began to permeate the Oval Office. “I remember thinking that it felt like the room was getting smaller,” recalled senior White House aide Marty Stratton, who said he and others watched in horror as a fiery pentagram scorched itself into the Oval Office rug’s Presidential Seal. Stratton said the event, which lasted “no more than three or four minutes,” ended abruptly. “The lights came back on and everything appeared normal,” he told Real News Right Now.

President Trump, who tried to remain out of the spotlight after his return from Europe last week, invited religious leaders to join him in the Oval Office on Monday following a planned meeting with representatives from the Office of Public Liaison."

DO YOU SUPPORT ARREST OF HIM?,[],"BREAKING: FBI Clasiffies BARACK OBAMA As A DOMESTIC TERRORIST. DO YOU SUPPORT ARREST OF HIM?

Do President Obama’s actions as President require him to be classified as a domestic terrorist? According to U.S. code, the answer is ‘YES’, and it’s not far off..

Via Viral Liberty

The fundamental change that Barack Obama promised those who supported his election is close to complete. The election of Hillary Clinton will ensure that the relationship between the people and THIS government will forever have been changed. The government will no longer belong to the people and any chance to return to government of the people, by the people, and for the people will likely have been lost forever. There is not even a semblance of accountability for any Washington insiders today and Mrs. Clinton and her minions have been the poster children for this corruption.

This is what tyranny looks like. Official lawlessness and corruption is ignored by a compliant press and by the equally corrupt and lawless members of the other branches of government.

The revelation that Clinton advisor and attorney Cheryl Mills was granted immunity by the FBI highlights the fact that no Washington insider is ever held to account for their actions no matter how illegal or damaging to the people they were elected or appointed to represent their actions may be. Had Richard Nixon lived today his transgressions would barely earn a footnote when the history of the past 8 years is recorded.

Once Barack Obama arrived in Washington the entire federal code defining treason against our country and the people might as well have been torn from the U.S. Code that defines it."

Next, Bill O’Reilly was booted from his show after stunningly similar accusations.

Now, the liberals’ next target is none other than conservative stalwart Sean Hannity, with one former Fox News contributor shouting the same accusations that brought down two media powerhouses.

KFAQ reports:

Columnist, attorney, and former Fox News contributor Debbie Schlussel appeared on today’s Pat Campbell Show and accused Fox News Prime Time Host Sean Hannity of the same type of behavior that lead to Bill O’Reilly leaving the beleaguered network earlier this week.

Among the allegations, Schlussel claims that while at an appearance in Detroit which they both attended, Hannity invited her back to his hotel room.

Schlussel says that after she turned down his advances, she was not invited back on his program.

“This kind of stuff is all over the place at Fox News and anything that has to do with Sean Hannity,” Schlussel said.

At this point, it looks like nothing other than a coordinated attack by the left to bring down the biggest conservative voices on television — and they’ve been successful so far.

The accident occurred near an I-15 off-ramp today around 5:15 PM. According to witnesses, a crowd of approximately 16 individuals pulled their vehicles to the side of the freeway and created a barricade by linking their arms together.

The protester’s actions immediately hindered the flow of traffic and motorists became upset at what many of them viewed as an unwanted obstacle preventing them from getting home after a long day at work. A few of the protesters were seen holding signs that read – “Not My President” or “Love Trumps Hate” and all protesters were chanting – “Dump Trump”.

After dealing with angry motorist for about 5-minutes, the group of protesters moved aside to allow the backed-up vehicles to resume their commute. Once a steady-flow of traffic resumed, the group of protesters once again linked arms to create a barricade for a second time.

It was at this time when Richard L. Porter, a 32-year-old Seattle resident employed by Waldrum Brother’s (a local appliance store) as a delivery driver quickly approached the chain of Anti-Trump protesters. According to Porter, he was driving with the current flow of traffic (around 80-MPH) when the obstruction created by the protesters seemed to appear out of nowhere.

By the time the protesters were visible to Porter – he didn’t have enough time to fully stop and though he did slam on his breaks and attempted to swerve, he ultimately ran into the group of protesters with the side of his delivery truck.

Porter was estimated to have been traveling at a speed of approximately 45-MPH when he collided with the group of Anti-Trump protesters. Several of the protesters were able to get out of the delivery truck’s path, however, 6 protesters were not able to move quickly enough and were ultimately struck and run over by the vehicle.

According to police reports, four of the fatally wounded protesters were killed upon impact and the other two protesters passed-away at a nearby hospital within hours.

Porter claims that the incident was a devastating accident and that he did everything possible to avoid hitting the protesters, however, many of the surviving protesters see things differently. The remaining group of protesters have told reporters that they believe Porter intentionally ran over them with his vehicle because he disagreed with their political beliefs.

Porter has adamantly denied the allegation that he intentionally collided with the protesters because of a difference in political views and told an NBC affiliate reporter that he’s a democrat who voted for Hillary Clinton.

According to statements from the police -they’re currently investigating the incident as a potential homicide and at the advice of his attorney, Porter has declined to make any further comments to the media."

A video of a bearded man allegedly raping his own grand daughter has went viral on YouTube, recording more than 150 thousand hits in a few hours. The video claims that the man is Sheikh Mohamad Kassem (or Qasim) Al Nasouh, an Imam in Deir El Zour, Syria, and a leader of the Ahbab Al Sahaba Islamistbrigade. Arabic News websites have widely reported on the video, while the Egypt Today website quoted activists saying that the man is indeed an Imam.

The video shows the man from a distance with the grand daughter, who seemed to be begging her allegedly maternal grandfather to stop. Seconds later, the man shooting the video surprises the grandfather, shouting “you are having sex with your grand daughter”, and then starts an interrogation, leading to the man’s confession. The grandfather claims that this is the first time this has happened. [hm…yeah right. We believe you. Not.]

The victim granddaughter, Yosra Mohamed Rashid, was roughed by the men, and heard begging them to leave her. She confessed that he was getting “pleasure” from her; the men showed no mercy or sympathy to her case. No sympathy for incest victims.

TRANSCRIPT:

We believe this translation is pretty close to correct, however may not be word for word. It is unknown who the camera man or his friend are.

Do You Support This?",[],"Citizens of Cincinnati, Ohio are one edge this morning after the gruesome scene that unfolded last night that investigators are calling the largest they’ve seen in more than 20 years. The after midnight bloodbath involving 15 victims and one gunman, has law enforcement scrambling. Now, the state’s governor, John Kasich, is about to address the nation.

What was supposed to be a fun Saturday night at the Cameo Club in the city turned into a death trap. Everyone in the place began running for their lives after a man entered and opened fire on patrons inside. One victim is dead, another is in critical condition, and thirteen more are wounded and receiving treatment for their injuries at an area hospital that’s become a revolving door of Cameo Club victims.

Although investigators don’t believe that this was an act of Islamic terrorism, as was seen the in the Orlando night club, they don’t have their suspect in custody yet, nor has a motive been determined, Assistant Police Chief Paul Neudigate said in a tweet, according to the Daily Mail. Just days after a terror attack struck London, the people of Ohio are rightfully terrified since the shooter remains at large with unclear motives about where he’ll turn up next.

The shooting took place at about 1:30 am on Sunday morning inside the club where hundreds of people were subject to this shooter’s wrath in a what devolved into a “chaotic crime scene.” Police are desperate to speak to those who ran and got away as they seek answers into the shooter’s identity and information about what they witnessed. It has yet to be determined if surveillance cameras were working at the time.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich sent a tweet offering is sadness and prayers to the club victims and their families: “Saddened to learn about last night’s shooting in Cincinnati. Our prayers are with the victims and families of all of those involved,” he wrote. “I’ve instructed our administration to offer any assistance the state can provide.”

Cameo Club has faced safety challenges before in 2015 when three men were left injured after being shot outside the venue. “Cincinnati Police Sergeant Eric Franz told CNN that the club hires police for extra security, with two officers at the entrance and two in the car park,” the Independent reported. That didn’t prevent a second, bigger bloodbath from happening last night, however, suggesting that perhaps the shooter waited it out inside before attacking.

It’s only a matter of time before liberals use this incident as a fight for gun control, despite not fighting for immigration control after the Islamic terrorist attack in London."

The youngsters, aged 11 and 12, said they found the crypt door broken and just wanted to see what it was like inside. They were treated so harshly because the caskets in the crypt had also been opened.

The corpses had been stripped of their jewelry, which included wedding bands and engagement rings, necklaces, bracelets, one tiara and several gold teeth. The boys didn’t have any of the stolen merchandise and were released to their parents. The investigation, however, turned up something far worse.

Illegal aliens, finding it harder to get jobs in Trump’s America, have been traveling the country in search of older cemeteries where people were more likely to be put in crypts or shallow graves without vaults and robbing them. Surveillance footage shows one van full of them pulling into a store just outside Chatanooga minutes after tearing open this 80-year-old family tomb and stealing more than $30K worth of jewelry:

The family is beside themselves with grief. One of the items stolen was a Congressional Medal Of Honor given to a trench soldier in World War I who saved the lives of more than 100 men with his bravery. The practice of grave-robbing isn’t something we see often her in America but it is prevalent in Mexico and other Central and South American countries.

The van full of thieves is still currently at large. If you spot them, do NOT approach them. They are armed with pickaxes, sledgehammers and explosive devices and are considered dangerous. Authorities are tracking them to catch them in the act, so please ignore them and go about your business."

In a given year, members of congress are on vacation for no less than four months. Lately that has been more like six or seven. While senators and representatives are often working when congress isn’t in session, a new report released by the WHOIP says that the American taxpayer is still footing the bill for no less than 14 weeks of paid vacations per year.

While the president has no authority over congressional pay, as it’s laid out by federal law and on the books, the chief executive does have control over distribution of benefits, which is how Trump has managed to do things like taking away Obama’s pension until he reaches retirement age. In an order signed today before he left for Mar-a-Lago for the weekend, Trump made it clear that in order to be compensated for vacation time, members of congress must be present on the floor for all roll calls and votes while their chamber is in session. They must also remain in Washington while congress is officially in session, even on weekends.

Trump spokesman and Twitter handler, Jeff, released a statement just minutes ago:

Congress is going to learn that they are representatives of the people who earn a very nice salary with extraordinary benefits. In order to reap the benefits of their position, they won’t be galavanting off to their home states on weekends on the taxpayer dime and taking vacations whenever they see fit. They may determine their own salaries, but the chief executive still maintains control over the treasury that disperses it.

Looks like congress is getting the hint that even if you’re a Republican, President Trump is going to make sure you serve the people.

Without the support of the Freedom Caucus and with many other Republicans distancing themselves from him, Ryan has turned to his secret allies to save him.

Those allies, which include 193 Democrats in the House and another 165 Republicans, met in a secret session Sunday night to see if they had enough numbers to start impeachment hearings…against President Trump! How can you call for the impeachment of a president who has done nothing other than his patriotic duty? Through corruption and lies.

One Republican who has managed to infiltrate the shadow government to keep tabs, Rep Harland O’Quinn (R- Montana) reports that of the 5 people there in the middle of the night to make a case for impeachment, 4 weren’t members of Congress at all and one of those was none other than Barack Obama, who shouldn’t be allowed on Capitol Hill to begin with.

Ryan and his lawless band of ingrates who were elected on the coattails of our great leader should be ashamed of themselves. The good news is that it looks like their mutiny will be short lived, as they’ll be 2 or 3 votes shy of the 2/3rds majority needed to impeach. President Trump hasn’t made a statement yet but surely he’s working hard to make sure his government remains intact and in control.

If these usurpers persist, it may be time for martial law in Washington."

Next, Bill O’Reilly was booted from his show after stunningly similar accusations.

Now, the liberals’ next target is none other than conservative stalwart Sean Hannity, with one former Fox News contributor shouting the same accusations that brought down two media powerhouses.

KFAQ reports:

Columnist, attorney, and former Fox News contributor Debbie Schlussel appeared on today’s Pat Campbell Show and accused Fox News Prime Time Host Sean Hannity of the same type of behavior that lead to Bill O’Reilly leaving the beleaguered network earlier this week.

Among the allegations, Schlussel claims that while at an appearance in Detroit which they both attended, Hannity invited her back to his hotel room.

Schlussel says that after she turned down his advances, she was not invited back on his program.

“This kind of stuff is all over the place at Fox News and anything that has to do with Sean Hannity,” Schlussel said.

At this point, it looks like nothing other than a coordinated attack by the left to bring down the biggest conservative voices on television — and they’ve been successful so far.

Of course, the surge in economic optimism was for good reason. On the campaign trail, Trump promised vital economic changes like tax and regulatory reform. Not only that, as one of the most successful businessmen in the world, Trump understood exactly what economic climate businesses needed to thrive.

Since taking office, none of this has changed. Trump’s inauguration day brought another surge of market optimism, leading to one of the best job growth quarters in a generation. He also immediately went to work on his economic agenda, slashing burdensome regulations crippling our economy.

Needless to say, liberals have opposed Trump’s agenda every step of the way. However, they might want to rethink their opposition after a new study revealed that Trump’s economic policies are already having a huge impact.

From The Hill:

President Trump has saved taxpayers more than $86 billion in regulatory costs during his first three months in the White House, according to a new study from a conservative group.

The American Action Forum (AAF) points to several Obama-era regulations that Trump has either rolled back on his own or with the help of Republican lawmakers using the Congressional Review Act (CRA).

In just a short time in office, Trump has been on what some have called a “deregulation binge.” Clearly, no stone is being left unturned by the new administration:

This includes the Education Department’s school accountability standards, the Environmental Protection Agency’s waters of the United States rule and the so-called “blacklisting” rule for government contractors.

These are just a few examples mentioned in the report. Since taking office, Trump and Congress have repealed 13 rules with the CRA. The CRA allows lawmakers to overturn recent rules they disapprove of with a simple majority in Congress, and send the action to the president for his signature.

This is great news for an economy hampered by eight years of overbearing government. In just a few months, President Trump has dismantled a large chunk of burdensome Obama-era regulations, resulting in a boom for the economy and the taxpayer.

What’s better is that all of this has been done in a relatively short amount of time. With over three years remaining in his term, Trump shows no signs of slowing down on slashing regulations. How much money taxpayers will save when all is said and done is anyone’s guess."

The employees of the meаt-pаckаging plаnt аre unionized, but the Muslim employees did not stаge their protest through the union; insteаd, they cаlled in the Council of Islаmic Relаtions to negotiаte on their behаlf.

The employees did not wаrn their employer of the impending strike аnd wаlked off the line without notice, cаusing severe finаnciаl dаmаge. The compаny hаd no choice but to fire them.

Mаny of the fired Muslim employees аre now begging for their jobs bаck, while the Islаmic council continues to negotiаte with the compаny of their behаlf. The compаny refuses to cаpitulаte аnd will simply hire less demаnding employees who аre more willing to work.

The liberаl mediа hаs coddled our Muslim immigrаnts into believing thаt they deserve speciаl treаtment. Their unreаlistic demаnds were rightfully shut down by the compаny. The meаt pаckаger wаs аlreаdy going аbove аnd beyond to аccommodаte their Muslim employees аnd finаlly decided enough wаs enough.

There аre mаny unemployed аmericаns who would be hаppy to replаce these ungrаteful Muslims аnd work without speciаl extrа breаks.

Muslims need to understаnd thаt in аmericа, аll people аre treаted equаlly, no one receives speciаl treаtment, аnd everyone is expected to contribute their fаir shаre.

Whаt do you think of the employer’s reаction? Pleаse shаre the story on Fаcebook аnd tell us whаt you think becаuse we wаnt to heаr YOUR voice!"

MOSCOW (Sputnik) — In November 2015, the IAAF banned Russian athletes from taking part in international competitions including the 2016 Summer Olympics.

""The Taskforce considered that material progress had been made towards reaching several of the conditions established by Council for reinstatement of RusAF to IAAF membership, but those conditions have not yet been met in full, and several important steps remain outstanding,"" the IAAF statement said.

Thus, RusAF did not show the taskforce that it had formed a strong and effective anti-doping infrastructure and created an atmosphere in which the activities of informants are encouraged. It also noted that had not been advised of any problems arising since April 2017 in the testing of Russian athletes by the IAAF's Athletics Integrity Unit or at national level under the supervision of UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).

The IAAF Council unanimously agreed to continue the suspension back at the beginning of July, the taskforce added.

""This report has gone to Congress to support the proposal to continue the suspension of RusAF's membership of the IAAF until all of the conditions set by Council for the cure of RusAF's breaches of the objects of the IAAF and for the consequent reinstatement of RusAF's membership have been met,"" the taskforce concluded.

© AFP 2017/ Mark RALSTON Empire of Whiners

With an Orwellian 99% majority that would delight the Kim dynasty in North Korea, the ""representative democracy"" Capitol Hill has bulldozed its latest House/Senate sanctions package , aimed mostly at Russia, but also targeting Iran and North Korea.

The White House's announcement — late Friday afternoon in the middle of summer — that President Trump has approved and will sign the bill was literally buried in the news cycle amidst the proverbial 24/7 Russia-gate related hysteria.

Trump will be required to justify to Congress, in writing, any initiative to ease sanctions on Russia. And Congress is entitled to launch an automatic review of any such initiative.

Translation; the death knell of any possibility for the White House to reset relations with Russia. Congress in fact is just ratifying the ongoing Russia demonization campaign orchestrated by the neocon and neoliberalcon deep state/War Party establishment.

Economic war has been declared against Russia for at least three years now. The difference is this latest package also declares economic war against Europe, especially Germany.

That centers on the energy front, by demonizing the implementation of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and forcing the EU to buy US natural gas.

Make no mistake; the EU leadership will counterpunch. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission (EC), put it mildly when he said, ""America first cannot mean that Europe's interests come last.""

On the Russia front, what the Empire of Sanctions faces does not even qualify as a hollow victory. Kommersant has reported that Moscow, among other actions, will retaliate by banning all American IT companies and all US agricultural products from the Russian market, as well as exporting titanium to Boeing (30% of which comes from Russia).

On the Russia-China strategic partnership front, trying to restrict Russia-EU energy deals will only allow more currency swaps between the ruble and the yuan; a key plank of the post-US dollar multipolar world.

And then there's the possible, major game-changer; the German front.

The Fools on the Hill

Even without considering the stellar historical record of Washington not only meddling but bombing and regime-changing vast swathes of the planet — from Iraq and Libya to the current threats against Iran, Venezuela and North Korea — the Russia-gate hysteria about meddling in the 2016 US presidential election is a non-story, by now thoroughly debunked.

The heart of the matter is, once again, energy wars.

According to a Middle East-based US energy source not hostage to the Beltway consensus, ""the message in these sanctions is the EU has no future unless it buys US natural gas to cut out Russia. To deny Russia the natural gas market of the EU was the goal behind the just lost war in Syria to put the Qatar-Saudi Arabia-Syria-Turkey-EU pipeline in and the opening to Iran for an Iran-Iraq-Syria-Turkey-EU pipeline. None of these plans worked.""

The source adds as evidence the 2014 oil price war against Russia, orchestrated by ""the dumping of Gulf States' surplus oil or reserve capacity on the world market. Since this has failed to bring Russia to its knees, the destruction of the Russian natural gas market in the EU has become a national priority for the United States.""

As it stands, 30% of all EU oil and natural gas imports come from Russia. In parallel, the Russia-China energy partnership is being progressively enhanced. Russia is already geared to increase oil and gas exports to China and Asia as a whole.

The leadership in Berlin is now convinced that Washington is jeopardizing Germany's energy diversification/energy security via the sanctions war. Russian natural gas and oil is secured by overland routes and is not dependent on the oceans, which, as the energy source stresses, ""are no longer under United States control. If Russia in response to United States belligerency drops an Iron Curtain over Europe, and redirects all its natural gas and oil exports to China and Asia, Europe will be utterly dependent on largely insecure sources of natural gas and oil such as the Middle East and Africa.""

And that bring us to the ""nuclear"" possibility in the horizon; a Germany-Russia alignment in a Reinsurance Treaty, as first established by Bismarck. CIA-related US Think Tankland is now actively discussing the possibility.

Another US business/political source, also a practitioner of thinking outside the (Beltway) box, stresses, ""this is what it's all about. That is the true goal of Russia, and the United States has fallen into the trap. The United States has had enough of Germany and what it considers dumping of German products on the United States through rigged currency. They are now threatening Germany with sanctions, and there is nothing Germany can do with the EU on their back facing vetoes from Poland, who is giving them trouble once again. The fools in Congress are really going after Germany, and throwing Germany in the arms of Russia.""

The US as the New Carthage

A possible Germany-Russia alliance, as I've written before, rounds up the China/Russia/Germany entente capable of reorganizing the entire Eurasian land mass.

The Russia-China strategic partnership is extremely attractive to German business, as it smoothes access via the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). According to the business/political source, ""the US is at war with China and Russia (but not Trump, our President) and Germany is having second thoughts about being nuclear cannon fodder for the US. I have discussed this in Germany, and they are thinking of renewing the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia. No one trusts this US Congress; it is considered a lunatic asylum. Merkel may be asked to leave for the leadership of the UN, and then the treaty would be signed. It will shake the world and end any thought of the United States being a global power, which it isn't anymore.""

© Sputnik/ Natalia Seliverstova German Businesses 'Interested' in Lifting Sanctions to Develop Ties With Russia

The source adds, half in zest, ""we think that Brzezinski died under the pressure of the realization that this was coming and that all his hatred of Russia and his life work to destroy them was becoming utterly undone.""

So, in a sense, it's ""welcome to the 1930s all over again and the rise of nationalism in Europe. This time Germany will not make the mistakes of 1914 and 1941 but will stand against their traditional Anglo-Saxon enemies. The United States has truly become today's Carthage and the disorder in Congress reflects the same stupidity of Carthage facing Rome. Legislators undermined their genius Hannibal as they are undermining the greatest president of the United States since Andrew Jackson. As Sophocles wrote in 'Antigone', 'God first makes mad those he wishes to destroy.' This Congress is mad.""

International media lit up in feverish speculation earlier this week after unsubstantiated reports emerged once again that Russia is supposedly arming the Taliban. Moscow struck back at these accusations by decrying them as baseless and part of a US disinformation campaign, which they are, but a few more words need to be offered about this provocative episode in order to place it into its proper context.

The US is aghast that Russia has taken the lead in organizing the Moscow peace process for Afghanistan, which has already seen three meetings hosted in the Russian capital involving all of the war-torn country’s regional stakeholders.

Granted, there’s still a lot of work that needs to be done before this framework can yield anything resembling tangible results, but it’s nevertheless a constructive step in the right direction and presents a multipolar alternative to the previously American-dominated initiatives on this issue.

Importantly, Russia’s policy has recently evolved to the point where Moscow has come to regard the Taliban as an indispensable party to reaching a political solution to the War on Afghanistan, and this is largely due to the group’s effective anti-terrorist fight against Daesh.

© AP Photo/ Allauddin Khan Daesh Declares War on Taliban - Reports

Russia has been warning for the past couple years about the “Islamic State’s” creeping infiltration into the Afghan battlespace, and the organization’s spate of attacks there over the past year have vindicated everything that Moscow was concerned about it and given its peace efforts a renewed impetus.

Correspondingly, Russia has also been engaged in a fast-moving and comprehensive rapprochement with Pakistan during this time as well, motivated by the shared threat that Daesh’s activities in Afghanistan pose to both Great Powers.

Pakistan is more directly affected by this stemming from the fact that it borders Afghanistan and that terrorists there could be exploited by Islamabad’s adversaries to wage the Hybrid War on CPEC, but Russia is also at risk because any large-scale destabilization of its CSTO allies in Central Asia could draw it into a new military conflict and also generate uncontrollable waves of “Weapons of Mass Migration” which could crash into the Russian heartland.

For these reasons, Russia and Pakistan have a common interest in bringing peace to Afghanistan and incorporating the Taliban into the country’s political process, but it’s this combination of factors which has thrown the US’ permanent military, intelligence, and diplomatic bureaucracies (the “deep state”) into such a tizzy. They understand the game-changing implications of the Russian-Pakistan rapprochement and fear that it might grow to the level of a geostrategic partnership, which is why they’re so eager to disrupt it at all costs.

There’s no better way to simultaneously complicate the security situation for both Russia and Pakistan than to destabilize the situation in Afghanistan, though the unintended blowback of this could inevitably be the further strengthening and possible expansion of the unfolding rapprochement between both sides in response.

Regardless of the possibly counterproductive consequences, the US “deep state” seems to have made up its mind to dispatch more soldiers to Afghanistan in order to bring this about, which could have the effect of intensifying the Taliban-Kabul conflict and preventing both sides from pooling their efforts together to defeat Daesh, to say nothing of advancing a political solution to their long-running war.

Trump, on the other hand, while grasping the strategic significance of deploying more boots on the ground in this tri-regional pivot state at the crossroads of West, Central, and South Asia, is also worried about the domestic political repercussions of doing so, especially if this results in more body bags being sent back to the homeland.

Furthermore, Trump distrusts his “deep state” to the point of being suspicious of practically all of his appointees, including his own National Security Advisor General H. R. McMaster according to reports. This senior administration figure had apparently been lobbying the President to authorize more troops to Afghanistan, but Politico writes that this was in vain because a “sh*t show” recently ensued which saw Trump dramatically rebuking McMaster by declining to deploy more soldiers and humiliatingly ordering the General’s proposal back to the drawing board.

It’s not known with any degree of absolute certainty why he made this decision, but it’s likely that the aforementioned domestic political considerations and “deep state” distrust played a guiding role, as well as the influence of his Chief Strategist Steve Bannon.

Reports circulated earlier this month that the former Breitbart executive is urging Trump to “outsource” the war to private military contractors (PMCs, also known as mercenaries) such as those under the control of his friend and infamous Blackwater founder Erik Prince.

The idea behind this proposal is that swapping uniformed US troops with PMCs will allow Trump to disingenuously make the case that he’s drawing down America’s conventional involvement in the War on Afghanistan and therefore win political points at home, all the while silently expanding its informal footprint through more mercenaries, many of whom are former US military personnel anyhow.

It’s also politically convenient for another reason as well – as the war intensifies, more Americans will inevitably be killed, but the public doesn’t react the same way to a mercenary’s death as they do to an official soldier’s, and the former isn’t necessarily a matter of public record, either.

US military casualties – whether uniformed or private – will probably become a more frequent occurrence in Afghanistan if Trump has his way in prying the country’s gargantuan untapped mineral reserves from the Taliban.

The New York Times reported earlier this week about how the President is now interested in the estimated $1 trillion of resources lying under Afghanistan’s soil, a sizeable chunk of which is presently under the Taliban’s control and consists of the rare earth minerals that China presently has a monopoly on.

These metals are indispensable to modern-day civilian electronics such as cell phones and military equipment like precision-guided missiles, so there’s clearly a strategic motivation for the US to dominate the extraction of Afghan minerals in order to either deny this resource to its competitors or control their access to it.

The resultant strategy that’s coming into play is one in which the US wants to push the Taliban out of its resource-rich areas, extract and export the rare earth minerals under the soil there, and ensure sustainable security for this entire operation, with the point of contention within the administration coming down to whether it should be uniformed US soldiers or private mercenaries that fight the Taliban.

The “deep state” wants the Pentagon to be in charge of this because it would guarantee that billions of tax-payer dollars continue pouring into their Afghan slush fund, which is notoriously known to be full of waste and corruption, because the pecuniary advantages to be reaped from PMCs are considerably limited to much fewer individuals such as Erik Prince and Stephen Feinberg (the owner of the DynCorp PMC), both of whom are regarded as Trump’s advisors.

In order to push their case that the military should be in charge of this ultra-profitable operation, the “deep state” concocted the fake news conspiracy theory that “Russia is arming the Taliban” in order to “play the Russia card” in pressuring Trump to side with the Pentagon as opposed to the PMCs.

They thought that they could manipulate the President into doing whatever they wanted on the foreign policy front so long as they found a way to incorporate the ongoing anti-Russian witch hunt into their demands, though it looks like Trump isn’t as doing what they expected (or at least not right away) because his personal cohorts have a financial interest in this enterprise too. No matter what Trump ultimately decides, and whether it’s to go forward with McMaster’s uniformed troop surge, the Bannon-Price-Feinberg PMC proposal, or a combination thereof, the US will do whatever it can to prevent the Moscow peace process from succeeding.

The $1 trillion mineral bonanza that’s made Trump all of a sudden interested in Afghanistan is too big of a potential prize for the billionaire businessman to pass up, and he knows that the US won’t be able to extract its envied mineral resources as long as the Taliban retains control of the territory above them.

Therefore, it’s expected that the US will attempt in one way or another – whether through the Pentagon and/or PMCs – to go on the offensive against the Taliban, possibly by having its soldiers and/or mercenaries play a decisive “Lead From Behind” role in using Kabul’s fighters as cannon fodder to this effect. The anticipated escalation of the War on Afghanistan and the inevitable window of opportunity that Daesh will see in all of this are bound to negatively impact on the security situation in the surrounding states, but it will also make it all the more important that Russia and Pakistan take their strategic cooperation to the next level in formulating a joint response.

A whimsical and utterly charming international comedy about a space race in 19th century Britain, shot in glorious Eastman color and filmed in Ireland's stunningly picturesque Wicklow Mountains, Rocket to the Moon encapsulated the sunny optimism of the era in which it was made.

""The music is a highlight and it is almost impossible to find, at times, a happier little film than this one is in spots,"" says one reviewer on IMDb.com.

At the time the film (whose American title was Those Fantastic Flying Fools) was released in July 1967, there was of course a real-life ""moon race"" going on between the US and the USSR — and one that didn't involve Tsarist agents, Troy Donahue and Phineas T. Barnum.

The Soviets had launched the first artificial satellite, (Sputnik, of course!) and put the first man (Yuri Gagarin) and the first woman (Valentina Tereshkova) into space. They also put the first animal into orbit too — a little dog named Laika.

Soviet achievements were being praised even by leading British Tory MPs.

""Forty years ago the Soviet Union was a backward country, poor, illiterate, and agricultural. Today she is identified with prodigious feats of science and technology,"" enthused Aubrey Jones in 1961 in the Sunday Times.

But the Americans, beaten in other areas, were determined to get to the moon first. President Kennedy proposed, in May 1961, that ""before this decade is out"" the US would land a man on the moon and return him safely to earth. ""We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard,"" Kennedy said eighteen months later at Rice University.

When Rocket to the Moon was released, we were in fact just two years away — to the very week — from the US achieving its goal — even though JFK sadly wasn't there to see it.

The Cold War had ""moved to the heavens,"" in the words of Jeremy Isaacs and Taylor Downing. But weren't we better off seeing a space race rather than increased hostilities on earth? Back in the 1960s we were all — to paraphrase Oscar Wilde — looking at the stars, and our dreams were very big indeed.

Fifty years ago, it seemed, as in the Victorian era — that all things were possible. A man on the moon. Supersonic passenger planes. The work-life balance sorted. Global equality. The eradication of terrible diseases. A genuine internationalism based on mutual respect between nations and cultures. There were still many problems, but the setbacks the US was experiencing in Vietnam, and the popular opposition to that war the world over were signs that imperialism had hit a brick wall.

Growing detente between east and west, brought about because the US couldn't get its way in south-east Asia, led many to hope that the Cold War would end in a merging of two systems. Western countries were certainly becoming more socialistic — with full employment, generous welfare provision and an extension of public ownership the norm. The working man — and woman — had never had it so good, in east and west. Music and films reflected the ""feel good"" factor of the time. The number one record of fifty years ago was appropriately enough ""All you need is love.""

So where did it all go wrong?

The problem was that those who supported detente in the west were pushed aside by those who wanted to destroy the Soviet Union, and indeed any economic system which put the needs of the majority first. The 1970s were the apogee of progressive politics, with historically low levels of inequality, and historically high levels of social/public ownership, but the decade also witnessed the start of the neocon/neoliberal fight back.

We saw examples of this with the toppling of the democratically elected socialist Salvador Allende in Chile in 1973, and the restructuring of the Chilean economy by ""The Chicago Boys"" — and in the battles inside the Carter administration from 1977-80. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance wanted to strengthen detente, but the aggressive hawk Zbigniew Brzezinski — Carter's National Security adviser, persuaded the president to back Islamist ""rebels"" in Afghanistan in order to ""bleed"" the Soviet Union for ""as much and as long as is possible.""

Things got even worse under Ronald Reagan, who stepped up the program for aiding the ""Mujahideen,"" leading to the birth of al-Qaeda. While in Britain, Margaret Thatcher, a Cold War warrior for the 1%, set about dismantling the equitable post-war economic settlement with glee.

The fall of communism at the very end of the 80s, cheered on even not just by the neo-cons, but by many ""progressives"" too, paved the way for a new, even more aggressive form of neo-liberalism and a series of brutal wars against independent nations by the US and its closest allies.

The results have been truly catastrophic. Today, half the world's wealth is owned by just eight individuals, while the living standards of ordinary people continues to fall.

""At home Euro-American policy elites — the least needy people the world has ever seen — are driving through a hard neo-liberal agenda in order to gnaw away at wages within their own territories."" writes Robert Hunter Wade, professor of political economy.

""Regime-change"" wars — waged for the benefit of the elites — have destroyed whole countries, created a refugee crisis of biblical proportions and helped spread terrorism around the globe.

We don't get films like Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon made any more. We get much darker artistic offerings, reflecting our more fearful, depressed times: The Hunger Games, Game of Thrones, Broadchurch and Nordic Noir films.

But remembering the Swinging Sixties, the race to the moon, and the cheery optimism of those much happier days, shows us it doesn't have to be like this.

Not BRICS+, For Sure",[],"So, who is hampering international trade? Experts agree that the recent summit of the G20 in Hamburg was characterized by certain changes in the dividing lines between economic “globalists” and “nationalists.”

President Donald Trump, the representative of the biggest of the “old successful” economies (the so called G7 group, formed back in the 1970s) was accused of protectionism. This was something new and unexpected for G20, a group created with the specific aim of fighting “protectionist instincts,” with the United States supposedly playing the role of the main lobbyist of free trade.

Sanctions as ""Adhesive"" for the West

The situation when the American president is almost officially called a destabilizing factor and even “a threat to European security” (in the words of the European Council’s head Donald Tusk) – this situation is disconcerting for the whole community of Western nations. In these circumstances, the so far futile economic sanctions that they jointly imposed on Russia may serve as a form of adhesive for the Western alliances.

So, even though these sanctions have so far failed to return to the “revolutionary” regime in Kiev its “counterrevolutionary” territories in the Russian-speaking east and south, attempts to economically strangle Donbass, Crimea and Russia as a whole will stay with us for duration. These sanctions are not needed by the people of Russia or Ukraine, but they help to keep the Western alliances and their loyal elite in Kiev together.

However, the recent American bill on anti-Russian sanctions, approved by the US congress’s House of Representatives, obviously went too far even for European politicians. The bill was criticized in a statement of the European Commission, and members of the business community questioned the legality of additional scrutiny and even punishments, which the bill imposes on the businessmen having connections to the Kremlin.

Wider Context

Anything can be a reason for sanctions from today’s Western world – the willingness of Crimeans to live in Russia, China’s attempt to build artificial islands in South China sea or even Poland’s judicial reform. Viewed in a wider context, the anti-Russian sanctions fit a general pattern of America’s and the EU’s attempts to economically sideline not just Russia, but any potential economic competitors, including China and other BRICS countries (BRICS standing for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa). The long history of the economic isolation of the former Soviet Union and Mao’s People’s Republic of China seems to confirm the feasibility of such plans on the side of the US and the EU. So, it is the West, and not Russia or China who does not want free trade.

What will be Russia’s response?

The Russian president Vladimir Putin at the summit in Hamburg called the anti-Russian economic sanctions “a hidden form of protectionism.” Moscow on a number of occasions stated that “sanctions are not our initiative” and vowed to continue looking for trade deals with the EU and other Western entities.

The Chinese leader Xi Jinping, speaking a few months earlier at the international business forum in Davos, Switzerland, praised global trade, saying that China was not afraid of fair competition. So, the Russian and Chinese leaders have learnt the lesson of the Soviet Union and of Mao’s China: self-isolation is not the answer, if anyone is against free trade, it is not us.

The irony of history is that supposedly “not open societies” of Russia and China at the G20 summit spoke out against protectionism, while the president of the biggest “open society” Donald Trump used protectionist rhetoric.

Ways to the Future

Whatever our old hopes and new expectations, one new development has to be admitted and accepted: the old core-periphery model of globalization is becoming simply dangerous for sustainable development.

The “core” in the old form of the G7 countries is no longer as all-mighty and reliable as before, and its “peacemaker credentials” are irrevocably tarnished by its interventions in the former Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya and Syria. The former periphery (especially the BRICS countries) is no longer the periphery any more, having gained substantial economic and political weight. So, the old “core-periphery” model, already characterized by imbalances and inequality, has to give way to “no core – no periphery” model of BRICS + (meaning BRICS plus its members’ regional and non-regional partner countries).

China, which is expected to host the next BRICS summit , lauded the BRICS+ project as the priority of the BRICS’ agenda for the years 2017-2018.

In a way the ideology of BRICS + could perhaps be called a different form of globalism. In some ways, BRICS+ is similar to the combination of TPP and TTIP, once lobbied for by the former president Obama. Just like BRICS+, the TPP-TTIP combination also includes five key pillars (also spread representatively across continents), namely the US, Japan, Canada, Australia and the EU.

The fact that BRICS countries are located on different continents (Russia, China and India being placed in Eurasia, while Brazil is in south America and South Africa occupies the farthest tip of the African continent) – this fact had long been seen as a weakness of BRICS. “What can such distant lands have in common?” – so sounded the common wisdom. But seen from the globalization point of view, this weakness becomes a strength. Located on three different continents, the BRICS countries might become “poles of attraction” for the developing economies of the “global South,” offering what might be termed as “balanced regionalism” as an attractive alternative to the old “core and periphery” model.

China’s One Belt One Road is a good example of an integration project which gives a chance to three beneficiaries: Russia, the developing economies located along the route of the ancient Silk Road and the countries of the former Soviet Union.

The EU member states are also going to be beneficiaries, with the Silk Road routes ultimately leading to their territories. And there are other examples of the budding BRICS+ relationships:

Russia-centered Eurasian Economic Union has a free trade agreement (FTA) with Vietnam; Latin American MERCOSUR union of countries (with Brazil at its center) has a free-trade agreement with Israel.

No More ""Forced"" Globalizations

BRICS+ formula can also benefit rich countries, becoming a framework for the already existing free-trade agreements (FTAs): one can mention the FTA between European Free Trade Agreement (EFTA) and the South African Customs Union (SACU), or the Japan-India comprehensive economic partnership agreement.

A new type of economic integration with BRICS+ at its center would provide a welcome alternative to the old US-EU-centric model of globalization which forced shock therapy on its peripheral countries (Russia and many countries of Latin America had a negative experience with this kind of “therapy”).

Even if for some time the Western globalization model and BRICS+ might coexist, this would provide the much needed competition in globalization models: a lot of experts explain the failures of the US-EU-centered globalization model (such as the 2007-2009 crisis) by absence of alternatives, which led to absence of competition and subsequent dearth of new ideas.

For Both Poor and Rich

The BRICS+ model is not going to ignore the existing rich countries or the already functioning global institutions, such as the World Trade Organization WTO.

The aim of BRICS+ is not to dominate, but to offer a link between the existing global institutions (such as WTO and IMF) and the amalgam of developing countries. The economic and financial weight of developing countries is no longer negligible: 14 out of 15 largest sovereign wealth funds are owned by the developing countries. However, these countries are underrepresented in the existing international institutions, still dominated by the G7. For example, in the IMF the consolidated share of the BRICS is just below the 15 percent mark. The addition of BRICS+ partners would raise the consolidated share of the vote by 1-2 percentage points to more than 15 percent. This would enable the BRICS+ to have a blocking stake with respect to the key decisions of the Fund.

It should be noted that countries willing to conduct a sovereign foreign policy (such as Russia and China) are interested in closer cooperation in the framework of BRICS+ also for financial security reasons. The modern Western elite is now often willing to use its dominance in the financial sphere for punishing the defiant international actors: the long-lasting exclusion of Iran from the operation of SWIFT system of international payments comes to mind. The BRICS+ could serve as a platform creation of its member countries’ sovereign payment systems. It could also be used for extending the use of national currencies in mutual trade transactions, thus reducing the dependence of BRICS and other non-Western countries on dollar and euro.

There is no doubt that the gaps and fissures which became apparent in the US-EU-centered economic system at the G20 summit in Hamburg – these gaps and fissures will only accelerate the creation and development of the BRICS+ integration model. There is too much void to fill on the currently monopolized market of “globalization models.”

The US has lost its six-year war for regime change in the Arab country. It's time to wrap it up.

It's not over yet, of course. It remains to be seen if Trump's decision can in fact be implemented. Can the CIA be reined in to obey orders? Will the US be able to stop regional client regimes, like Saudi Arabia, from stepping up their covert supply of American weapons to the militants in Syria?

Also, Trump's decision does not mean the US and its allies will withdraw ground and air forces from Syria, where they are illegally operating in violation of international law.

© AFP 2017/ LOUAI BESHARA End of CIA Program for Syrian Rebels Means Assad's Removal From Power No Longer Priority for US

Nevertheless, the American president's declared ending of the CIA's role in fueling the insurgency in Syria should be seen as a welcome move. It is the right thing to do, and a brave one also because of the anti-Russia flak he is bound to receive for taking the decision. It would have been politically expedient for Trump to have not pulled the plug on the CIA in Syria. But by doing so, he is bound to compound the anti-Russia hysteria gripping Washington and large sections of the media accusing him of being a ""Kremlin stooge"".

Any rational person would have to agree that the best way to end the violence in Syria is for foreign countries to halt pouring weapons into the country. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has long maintained this logical position: if nations want Syria's bloodshed to stop, as they claim, then they should stop supplying arms and cut out sponsoring militant groups.

By its own admission, the US has been funneling weapons into Syria since at least 2013, according to media reports, and probably before that date right back to the beginning of the war in March 2011. Not only the US but its NATO partners, Britain, France and Turkey, as well as regional allies Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Israel. This is an admission of a criminal conspiracy to destabilize a sovereign country by supporting illegally armed anti-government militant groups. It matters little whether these groups are arbitrarily designated ""moderate rebels"". They are illegally armed.

With a Syrian death toll of up to 400,000 over six years of war, millions of refugees and a culturally rich country driven to the brink of destruction, it is blindingly obvious that Trump made the right call to at least partially reduce the flow of weapons, by ending the CIA program. It is well past time to bring the US-led criminal assault on Syria to an end.

Trump's call was also a brave one because the US media immediately and predictably depicted the move as a ""concession to Russia"". With the US president already being assailed with endless accusations of ""colluding"" with Russia in winning the election to the White House last year, his decision to leash the dogs of war in Syria this week only lends more grist to the Russophobia rumor mill.

The Washington Post headlined the news with: ""Trump ends covert CIA program to arm anti-Assad rebels in Syria, a move sought by Moscow"".

Several other US media outlets followed suit, making snide comments that the move ""will please the Kremlin"" and that Trump was ""appeasing Putin"" by closing down the CIA covert operations in Syria.

The American corporate media persist with the myth that the CIA has been backing ""moderate rebels"". When in reality, the ""moderate rebels"" and the ""terrorist jihadists"" are one and the same motley army of mercenaries. Mercenaries who have barbarized the Syrian people with sickening massacres, under the tutelage of the CIA and other foreign military services.

With contorted logic, US media spin that Trump's shuttering of the CIA program to train ""moderate rebels"" in Syria may now strengthen the hand of ""extremists"".

The president is accused of capitulating to Putin on Syria. There are mutterings in the US media suggesting that this is what Trump talked about with Putin during their meetings in Hamburg at the G20 summit earlier this month. Especially, during the so-called ""secret meeting"" in front of 18 other heads of state while at dinner.

What the incorrigible lying US media don't get is that American involvement in Syria has been a criminal enterprise from the get-go, constituting a monumental crime against peace and humanity. The US-sponsored terrorism in Syria has gone on for far too long. No amount of sanitizing by the media can alter that brutal truth.

It was Russia's principled decision at the end of 2015 to intervene in Syria, in accordance with international law, that began to bring the criminal conspiracy to an end. Two years on, the Syrian state is beginning to get the upper-hand over the foreign-backed militant groups that have ravaged the country. Russia's military support has been vital to that impending victory.

""The shuttering of the [CIA] program is also an acknowledgment of Washington's limited leverage and desire to remove Assad from power,"" noted the Washington Post.

In other words, begrudgingly, the US war for regime change in Syria is being acknowledged as a defeat. And it is Russia that ensured that defeat.

The Washington Post quotes one US official as saying more openly: ""It is a momentous decision. Putin won in Syria.""

Rather than coming clean and admitting that the US has been engaged in a sordid, criminal war on Syria which it has finally lost, the American media are now spinning Trump's ending of CIA operations as a ""concession"" to Russia.

For all his flaws, and there are many, at least Donald Trump knows when to admit that the US war in Syria is a loser. And despite the carping Russophobia trying to box him in, Trump appears ready to take the right decision to bring this criminal American war to an end.

Since the New York Times broke the story last weekend of the meeting between Donald Trump Jr and the Russian lawyer there has been a frenzy among the anti-Trump political camp that the so-called ""Russia-gate"" affair has reached a critical moment.

© AP Photo/ Alexander Zemlianichenko Russian Lawyer Veselnitskaya Crossed US Border Under Special Immigration Parole

Demands for impeachment have grown because, it is asserted, a member of the Trump campaign team met with a ""Kremlin-connected lawyer who had information to damage Clinton"".

If you read the story in this way then perhaps the ""smoking gun"" conclusion might be made: Trump's son, Donald Jr, responds ""I love it"" when told in an email that a Russian lawyer working for the Kremlin wants to give him information that would politically damage Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential contender against his father.

Trump Jr did indeed respond enthusiastically to the offer and the meeting did take place at Trump Tower in New York City on June 9 last year, two weeks after his father won the Republican party's nomination for president. Donald Jr earlier this week released a batch of private emails confirming those details.

Political opponents of President Trump, mainly Democrats but also Republicans, as well as prominent news media outlets, like The New York Times, Washington Post and CNN, are now saying that the meeting between Trump's son and the Russian lawyer is the ""first hard evidence"" of the alleged Russia collusion to interfere in US democracy.

© REUTERS/ Steffen Kugler/Courtesy of Bundesregierung Trump Jr Scandal Coverage Meant to Overshadow Putin-Trump Meeting - Kremlin

However, this version of the story has a crucial fatal flaw. All the claims made to Trump Jr about the ""Kremlin-connected lawyer"" and the ""Russian government wanting to help Trump get elected"" are deeply suspect. The grandiose claims were made by a former British tabloid journalist named Rob Goldstone who appears to be acquainted with Trump Jr.

Goldstone, who works as a publicist and an entertainments manager, wrote to Trump Jr to set up a meeting with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya. The lawyer was acting for the family of Russian pop star Emin Agalarov.

It turns out that the Russian lawyer wanted to meet the Trump campaign to make legitimate representations about US legislation known as the Magnitsky Act (2010), which has sanctioned several Russian individuals and business people over alleged human rights abuses.

Natalia Veselnitskaya, the attorney, has this week told US media that this was the sole subject of the meeting with the Trump campaign, and that she was not acting on behalf of the Russian government, but rather in a private professional capacity. She also said that she never had any intention to discuss Hillary Clinton with Trump Jr. As far as she was concerned, the meeting was only about issues related to the Magnitsky Act.

The Kremlin has confirmed that Veselnitskaya does not work for the Russian government. In fact, the Kremlin said it was not even aware of her legal practice.

Trump Jr also confirmed in subsequent media interviews that his meeting with Veselnitskaya was an anti-climax. He says he heard ""nothing"" about Clinton from the Russian lawyer, whom he said wanted to talk about Magnitsky issues. ""I realized that this was the real purpose for the meeting,"" said Trump Jr.

That means that Trump Jr was misled by the music publicist Rob Goldstone. For whatever reason, Goldstone embellished the nature of the forthcoming meeting with the lawyer as being about juicy political gossip to help the Trump election campaign.

In other words, the former tabloid hack was putting his own spin on the matter by claiming that the lawyer was ""Kremlin-connected"" and was conveying ""information from the Russian government to damage Clinton in order to help Trump's election"".

The lawyer for the family of Emin Agalarov, the Russian singer who asked Goldstone to set up the meeting between Trump Jr and Veselnitskaya, has now come out to rubbish the claims made by Goldstone.

""The vast majority of what Rob Goldstone said in email exchange with Donald Trump Jr is not accurate,"" Agalarov's family attorney, Scott Balber, told RT. ""The only thing that's true is that Emin asked the meeting to be arranged. The rest of it is not true, it's false.""

So there you have it. It appears that the US media frenzy this week about obtaining a ""smoking gun"" implicating Trump in collusion with the Russian government to subvert the American presidential election is yet another over-the-top sensation with little factual basis.

Simply put, the Russian government was not involved in US election interference, as the Kremlin has maintained all along.

What the US media are basing their latest collusion allegations on are merely claims made by a former British tabloid hack and pop star publicist who would have had self-serving reasons to ham up the ""goods"" in order to sell Trump Jr a scoop.

This would not be the first time that the Russia-gate affair has relied on dodgy information from a dubious British source. Recall that the ""dirty dossier"" was authored by former British MI6 spy Christopher Steele, who made outlandish claims that the Kremlin had ""Kompromat"" on Donald Trump Sr from hotel orgies with Russian prostitutes.

Granted, one could censure Donald Trump Jr for being willing to receive information from what he believed to be Russian government sources to take down Clinton. But, hey come on, that's politics and the dirty business of ""opposition research"" which all parties engage in. It's impossibly naive and self-righteous to pummel Trump Jr over it.

Anyway, the salient fact remains that there was no such transfer of information from the Russian government to the Trump campaign. The US media are once again going off on a tangent, chasing their tails and tilting at windmills.

To make a grandstanding big deal about Trump Jr's conduct is the height of hypocrisy, especially in light of Hillary Clinton's campaign having commissioned the British ex-spy Christopher Steele to dig dirt on Trump Sr, as reported by award-winning investigative journalist Robert Parry.

The whole ""Russia-gate"" affair is a wild fiction dreamt up by powerful American elements who frankly refuse to abide by democracy. To make things worse, Russia is embroiled as a villain in the piece, which ensures US-Russia bilateral relations deteriorate to dangerous levels of hostility, where even the breakout of war has become a real possibility.

Washington and the US media have been in thrall to this fantasy for the past seven months, and yet still no evidence has been unearthed to justify the squandering of taxpayer money and paralysis of American government. It's not Russia that is undermining US democracy. It is Americans themselves.

The so-called ""smoking gun"" of Trump Jr meeting a Russian lawyer for 20 minutes last year is another dud in a heap of duds. This is no smoking gun. More like a joke water pistol.

After their breakthrough first meeting, one hopes the two leaders have a personal foundation for future cooperation.

© REUTERS/ Carlos Barria Putin Reveals What He Discussed With Trump During Two-Hour-Long Meeting

At a later press conference in Hamburg, where the G20 summit was held, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he believed there was a chance for restoring the badly frayed US-Russia relations. He praised Trump for being thoughtful and rational. “The TV Trump is quite different from the real life one,” quipped Putin.

Meanwhile, the White House issued a statement hailing the two-hour discussion (four times longer than originally scheduled) between the two leaders as a good start to working together on major world problems.

“No problems were solved. Nobody expected any problems to be solved in that meeting. But it was a beginning of a dialogue on some tough problem sets that we’ll begin now to work on together,” said HR McMaster, Trump’s top national security adviser.

Trump deserves credit for the way he conducted himself. He met Putin on equal terms and with respect. “It’s an honor to meet you,” said the American president as he extended a handshake.

The much-anticipated encounter comes nearly seven months after Trump was inaugurated in the White House. Over that period, large sections of the US media have run an unrelenting campaign accusing Trump of being a Russian stooge and alleging that Putin ordered an interference operation in last year’s US election to benefit Trump.

Apart from innuendo and anonymous US intelligence claims, recycled endlessly by dutiful news organizations, there is no evidence of either Trump-Russia collusion or Putin-sanctioned cyber hacking . Trump has dismissed the claims as “fake news”, while Moscow has consistently rejected the allegations as baseless Russophobia.

Against this toxic background of anti-Russian propaganda, President Trump met Putin at the weekend. The two men were due to talk face-to-face for 30 minutes. As it turned out, their discussions went on for two hours. They reportedly exchanged views on pressing matters of Syria, Ukraine and North Korea among other things. Trump brought up the issue of alleged Russian meddling in the US elections, and Putin responded in detail to assure his American counterpart it was a fabricated brouhaha in which Russia had nothing to do with it.

Only days before the big meeting, US media editorialists and pundits were warning Trump to confront Putin in an aggressive manner. The Washington Post, one of the leading anti-Russia voices, exhorted Trump to rap Putin on “US election meddling” as if the claim was a proven fact. It also urged the president to give notice to Putin that Russia had to accede to regime change in Syria. It was a get-tough order.

To his credit, Trump did not allow the Russophobia in the US media to influence his manner with Putin. He was cordial, respectful and open to listening to the Russian viewpoint on a range of issues. So much so that it appears both leaders have agreed to work together going forward.

The question now is: what next? Trump and Putin have evidently got off to a good start despite the inordinate delay and toxic background. But what does Trump’s willingness to engage positively with Moscow actually mean in practice?

© REUTERS/ Steffen Kugler/Courtesy of Bundesregierung Political Knockout: Western Media Blasts Trump After Meeting With Putin

The US Deep State comprising the military-intelligence nexus and their political, media machine in Washington does not want to normalize relations with Russia. Russian independence as a powerful foreign state under President Putin is a problem that rankles US global ambitions. That’s why the Deep State wanted anti-Russia hawk Hillary Clinton to win the election. Trump’s victory upset their calculations.

Under immense pressure, Trump has at times appeared to buckle to the US political establishment with regard to projecting hostility towards Russia, as seen in the prosecution of the covert war in Syria and renewed sanctions on Moscow.

The day before he met Putin in Germany, Trump was in Poland where he delivered a barnstorming speech in Warsaw in which he accused Russia of “destabilizing countries”, among other topics. The American president also inferred that Russia was undermining “Western civilization”. It was provocative speech bordering on hackneyed Russophobia. It did not bode well for his imminent meeting with Putin. A clash seemed to be coming, just as the US media had been cajoling.

However, the meeting the next day with Putin was surprisingly congenial. And the substance of discussions indicates a genuine desire from both sides to cooperate.

It is good that both presidents have struck up a rapport and personal understanding. Nevertheless, it is important to not bank too much on that.

Immediately following the constructive meeting between the leaders, the US media started cranking up the Russophobia again. The US media are vents for Deep State hostility towards Trump and his agenda for normalizing relations with Moscow.

The New York Times reported another breathless story about Trump’s election campaign having contact with “Kremlin-connected” people. CNN ran opinion pieces on how the president had fallen into a trap laid by Putin.

It is hard to stomach this outlandish confabulation that passes for journalism. And it is astounding that a friendly meeting between leaders of nuclear powers should not be received as a good development.

But it shows that Trump his up against very powerful deep forces within the US establishment who do not want a normalization with Russia. The US Deep State depends on confrontation, war and endless militarism for its existence. It also wants a world populated by vassals over which US corporations have suzerainty. An independent Russia or China or any other foreign power cannot be tolerated because that upends American ambitions for unipolar hegemony.

Trump’s encounter with Putin was commendable because he did not succumb to toxic Russophobia and adopt a stupid, mindless tough-guy posture. Instead, Trump reached out to Putin in a genuine way, as two human beings should do.

The US Deep State is not about humanity or understanding. It is about maintaining perceived dominance over other humans, where anyone seen to be an obstacle is disposed of in the most ruthless way.

President John F Kennedy was assassinated in broad daylight by the US Deep State because he dared to seek a normalization and peaceful coexistence with Moscow. The Deep State does not want normalization or peace with Russia or anyone else for that matter because there are too many lucrative vested interests in maintaining the war machine that is American capitalism.

This is not to predict a violent demise for Trump. The Deep State has other methods, such as the orchestration of media and other dirty tricks.

Trump’s friendly overtures to Russia are at least a promising sign. But given the power structure of the US, and its incorrigible belligerence, it is doubtful that Trump will be allowed to go beyond promises. If he attempts to, we can expect the dark forces to step up.

What needs to change is the US power structure through a democratic revolt. Until that happens, any president in the White House is simply a hostage to the dark forces of the Deep State.

It's revealing to compare the stories that have made the headlines in the western media in the first six months of 2017, with those that haven't.

There's been saturation coverage of alleged Russian interference in the US presidential election — and Russian state ""hacking"" in general — even though no hard evidence of these activities has yet been produced.

The ""threat"" posed to us all by ""the rogue state"" of North Korea has also been a regular headliner.

While in April, the ""big story"" was of a chemical weapons attack in Syria — which was blamed very quickly on the Syrian government, even though its guilt was unproven.

By contrast these very important stories below received nowhere near the same amount of coverage they should have.

The World's Biggest Humanitarian Crisis Since WWII

No, it's not in Syria, but in Yemen. In March, the UN warned that up to 20 million people were at risk of starvation and famine in Yemen, Somalia, South Sudan and Nigeria — with two-thirds of the population of Yemen needing assistance. In June, the World Health Organization said that 1,310 people had died in a cholera epidemic in Yemen and warned that 300,000 people could be infected by the end of August.

Yemen has been bombed for the past two years by staunch western-ally Saudi Arabia, with US and UK not only providing the weaponry, but logistic support. The ""humanitarian interventionists"" in the western media meanwhile keep schtum. The ""responsibility to protect,"" it seems, does not apply to civilians in Yemen.

The Yemen situation is very quiet also. Im assuming it is because the damage is being done by UK weapons via Saudi — Steven o' Scotland (@StevenOScotland) July 3, 2017​

'Liberated' Afghanistan in Flames

When the country was ""liberated"" by the US-led coalition in 2001, there was wall-to-wall coverage. But sixteen years on, the war not only continues but has intensified.

The Taliban, whose defeat was toasted sixteen years ago, now controls between 30-50% of the country. Daesh also has an increasing presence.

There's been a big spike in terror attacks in 2017, with 90 killed in one incident in Kabul in May — and over fifty killed in separate attacks across the country a week earlier.

But this isn't news, or at least not big news, on a par with ""Russian hacking."" The ""liberators"" of Afghanistan are too busy trying to ""liberate"" Syria.

Almost Half a Million Refugees to Their Homes in Syria

Yes, that's right, refugees are returning to Syria. The UNHCR says that almost 500,000 have gone back to their homes so far in 2017. But they're returning to areas which are under government-control or liberated from anti-government ""rebels,"" which rather goes against the official narrative that they were fleeing the Syrian government, doesn't it?

USUK media for years claimed Syria refugees 'fleeing Assad'. Yet with rebels now gone, already 500,000 have returnedhttps://t.co/YSP0oJL5jh — Charles Shoebridge (@ShoebridgeC) June 30, 2017​

So, in the legendary words of Leslie Nielsen in Naked Gun, it's a case of:

""Alright, nothing to see here, please disperse!""

Israel's Airstrikes on Forces in Syria Fighting al-Qaeda/Daesh/al-Nusra

Israel's been bombing Syria quite a lot in 2017. But it hasn't been targeting ISIS/Daesh or al-Qaeda affiliates, the sort of groups which carried out or inspired terror attacks against European civilians in Europe the past year, but the forces fighting ISIS/Daesh and al-Qaeda affiliates.

The strikes have been widely reported in the Israeli media, but the role of Israel in effectively strengthening the position of Daesh/al-Qaeda in Syria, hasn't received much — if any — real coverage in western countries.

Again, Leslie Nielsen and that famous Naked Gun scene springs readily to mind.

2017: Likely to Be the Fourth Consecutive Hottest Year in History

Trump's Paris climate accord pull-out made headlines, but apart from that there's been nowhere near enough coverage of the fact that that the planet continues to get hotter — and the dangers that poses to life on earth.

In March, the World Meteorological Organization warned that we were entering ""truly uncharted territory.""

Just a few days ago, temperatures in the Iranian city of Ahvaz reached a mind-boggling 54 degrees Celsius — the hottest temperature ever recorded in June in mainland Asia.

May 2017 was the second warmest May in 137 years of modern record-keeping: https://t.co/pWawcMLk1q pic.twitter.com/NXoszHnkp8 — NASA GISS (@NASAGISS) June 15, 2017​

May 2017 meanwhile, was the second hottest since records began.

But hey, let's focus instead on UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn meeting with some guys from Sinn Fein thirty years ago, shall we? That's far more important.

UK State Collusion With Radical Islamic Jihadists

The terrorist attacks in the UK in the spring of 2017 of course made the headlines, but what wasn't up for discussion was the role the UK government and MI5/6 had played in cultivating and colluding with extremist groups — like the LIFG (Libyan Islamic Fighting Group) which Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi was associated with.

""Critical questions — such as why the security service MI5 maintained terrorist 'assets' in Manchester and why the government did not warn the public of the threat in their midst — remain unanswered,"" wrote John Pilger.

Abedi/father fought for #Libya LIFG in 2011. UK worked alongside Libyan Islamists at this time, probably LIFG. https://t.co/MneebE4Yga https://t.co/qtq2pX9nbC — Mark Curtis (@markcurtis30) May 27, 2017​

""The 'smoking gun' is that when Theresa May was Home Secretary, LIFG jihadists were allowed to travel unhindered across Europe and encouraged to engage in 'battle': first to remove Muammar Gaddafi in Libya, then to join al-Qaeda affiliated groups in Syria.""

It was a ""smoking gun"" that major western news outlets conveniently chose not to notice.

The Multiple Terror Attacks in Pakistan

Like neighboring Afghanistan, Pakistan has seen a big spike in terrorism in 2017 — and like Afghanistan — it hasn't made the headlines.

In January, 25 people were killed when a vegetable market was bombed in Parachinar.

In February, at least 88 were killed in a suicide bomb attack on a shrine in Sehwan.

There has been attacks every couple of days in Pakistan with many dead and injured. No coverage here of that either. — Grace Murphy (@GraceMurphy2) July 2, 2017​

Last week (end of June) another 75 people lost their lives in market bombings in Parachinar.

The attacks have received scant coverage. And — guess what — the Eiffel Tower's lights weren't switched off, nor were its colors changed to the Pakistan flag, in solidarity.

Pakistani victims of terrorism are, like Syrians, ""unpeople"" for western media ""humanitarians.""

The Conflict and Chaos in 'Liberated' Libya

There have been heavy battles in Tripoli as rival factions fight for control of the Libyan capital.

Meanwhile, slave markets have returned to the country which had the Highest Human Development Index in Africa just eight years ago.

Libya is a failed state — transformed by NATO into a jihadist theme park. But let's ignore the North African hell-hole shall we, and make the case for further western ""liberal interventions"" against states with the ""wrong"" governments.

Daesh Hits Iran

Yes, that‘s right. Iran, the country we're told ad nauseam is the ""world's greatest sponsor of terrorism"" was hit by deadly terror attacks on its Parliament and at the shrine of Ayatollah Khomeini.

© AP Photo/ Ebrahim Noroozi Police officers control the scene, around of shrine of late Iranian revolutionary founder Ayatollah Khomeini, after an assault of several attackers in Tehran, just outside Tehran, Iran, Wednesday, June 7, 2017

ISIS/Daesh — the same group that's been targeting civilians in Europe — claimed responsibility, but highlighting how the world's worst terror group and Iran are enemies contradicts the official narrative about Iran, doesn't it?

So let's move on to another story, pretty damn quickly.

Upsurge in Violence in Congo

Thousands have been killed in recent months in the African state and more than a million have been displaced over the last year. But rather like the war between 1998-2003 which is thought to have cost the lives of over 5 million people, it's had nowhere near the same level of media coverage as the conflict in Syria.

""I can't say that the Congolese, we are in control of our destiny. No, because the ones who benefit from our minerals are not the local population, but western countries are the ones who are taking everything. They make themselves rich, while we are getting poorer and poorer,"" a Congolese, Bernard Kalume Buleri, told a new RT documentary.

Would we be hearing more about the desperate plight of the people in Congo if western countries weren't ""taking everything""?

I'll let you make your own mind up.

Considering the impenetrability of that desert petrodollar family oligarchy impersonating a nation it’s up to a few foreigners granted access to make sense of the latest Arabian Game of Thrones. It also does not help that the “largesse” of Saudi – and Emirati – lobbies in Washington reduces virtually every think tank and hack in sight to abject sycophancy.

A top Middle East source close to the House of Saud, and a de facto dissident of the Beltway consensus, minces no words; “The CIA is very displeased with the firing of [former Crown Prince] Mohammad bin Nayef. Mohammad bin Salman is regarded as sponsoring terrorism. In April 2014 the entire royal families of the UAE and Saudi Arabia were to be ousted by the US over terrorism. A compromise was worked out that Nayef would take over running the Kingdom to stop it.”

© REUTERS/ Jonathan Ernst Saudi Hijinks, US Policy Stinks

Before the Riyadh coup, an insistent narrative had been pervading selected Middle East geopolitical circles according to which US intel, “indirectly”, stopped another coup against the young Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim al-Thani, orchestrated by Mohammad bin Zayed, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, with help from Blackwater/Academi's Eric Prince’s army of mercenaries in the UAE. Zayed, crucially, happens to be MBS’s mentor.

Our source clarifies, “the events are connected. Prince is CIA, but he probably stopped any coup attempt on Qatar. The CIA blocked the coup in Qatar and the Saudis reacted by dumping the CIA selected Mohammed bin Nayef, who was to be the next King. The Saudis are scared. The monarchy is in trouble as the CIA can move the army in Saudi Arabia against the king. This was a defensive move by MBS.”

The source adds, “MBS is failing everywhere. Yemen, Syria, Qatar, Iraq, etc. are all failures of MBS. China is also displeased with MBS as he has been stirring up trouble in Xinjiang. Russia cannot be happy that MBS was and is behind the lower oil price. Who are his allies? He has only one and that is his father, who is hardly competent.” King Salman is virtually incapacitated by dementia.

The source is adamant that, “it is very possible the CIA will move against the monarchy in Saudi Arabia.” That would qualify as the war between President Trump and selected sectors of the US deep state reaching a whole new level.

And to add to the charade, there’s the Jared of Arabia factor. There's no way any serious inside player would confirm anything about the (aborted) coup in Qatar. But if that coup attempt really happened, and was squashed, Jared Kushner may have had inside information, considering his connections.

According to the source, “Jared Kushner is essentially bankrupt at 666 Fifth Avenue, and needs Saudi financial help. So he is doing everything the Saudis want. 666 Fifth is in such bad financial shape that even his father-in-law cannot bail him out.”

Operation Desert Hubris

This convoluted trail of events does corroborate the famous December 2015 memo by the BND – German intelligence, according to which the House of Saud had adopted “an impulsive policy of intervention”, with then Defense Minister and Deputy Crown Prince MBS, a “gambler”, bound to cause a lot of trouble.

The BND memo detailed how the House of Saud, in Syria, bankrolled the creation of the Army of Conquest – basically a revamp of Jabhat al-Nusra, a.k.a. al-Qaeda in Syria — as well as ideological sister outfit Ahrar al-Sham. Translation; the House of Saud aiding, abetting and weaponizing Salafi-jihadi terrorism. And this from a regime that now charges Qatar of doing the same (Doha supported different outfits).

© AP Photo/ Nader Daoud Once Again, Saudi Funding for Foreign Terrorism May be Hidden from Public

In Yemen, the BND worried that MBS’s war against the Houthis and the Yemeni Army was only profiting al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Now MBS’s war – conducted with American and British weapons — has also provoked a horrendous humanitarian catastrophe.

How come an arrogant, sloppy, hubristic ignoramus like MBS has come so close to set the whole of Southwest Asia on fire? And not only Southwest Asia; waves of despair are flowing in Western investment circles to the effect that MBS is such a loose cannon his actions will destroy retirement accounts all over the spectrum.

Some essential background is in order. What we have today is the Third Saudi kingdom — founded by Ibn Saud in 1902, keeping the same, previous noxious alliance with troglodyte Wahhabi clerics. Ibn Saud only ruled Najd in the beginning; then, in 1913, he annexed Shi’ite Eastern Arabia (that’s where the oil is), and up to 1926 Hejaz, on the Red Sea coast. A “united” Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was proclaimed only in 1932.

Ibn Saudi died in 1953. Arguably the most influential of his harem of wives was Hassa al-Sudairi. They had 7 sons together. (Demented) King Salman, Nayef and MBS are all Sudairis. MBS is the first of Ibn Saud’s grandsons within striking reach of the throne.

Quite a few other princes are more competent that MBS. Nayef, who spent a long time in the Interior Ministry, was the Saudi counterterrorism czar (thus being a CIA darling). There’s Mitab bin Abdullah, minister of the Saudi Arabian National Guard; notorious Prince Turki, former intel chief, former ambassador to the US, and former best pal of Osama bin Laden; and Khaled bin Faisal, governor of Mecca and former education minister.

© REUTERS/ Bandar Algaloud/Courtesy of Saudi Royal Court Promoted Saudi Crown Prince 'Betting On Trump's Support For New Policies'

MBS is betting everything on his Vision 2030 – which in theory might propel the Saudi economy beyond oil monoculture, but implies a virtually impossible political aggiornamento; after all the House of Saudi Cards is un-reformable. Take the risible list of 13 demands now imposed on Qatar – that’s MBS’s work – including the bellicose virtual excommunication of Iran and shutting down al-Jazeera.

No wonder every major geopolitical player is now gaming war scenarios – although only Germany stated its concerns on the record. Qatar is a NATO observer. Doha is adamant; it won’t fold to the absurd Saudi demands. What next; will MBS – the most dangerous “leader” in geopolitics today – lose face or launch yet another, demented, unwinnable and this time globally-convulsing war?

© Sputnik/ Sergey Malgavko Winter Wonders of Crimea 10

The theme of economic sanctions against Russia and especially against its region of Crimea is becoming a real bonanza for lawyers. First, the US Senate tried to introduce the legislation that would make president Trump's administration incapable of lifting the sanctions on Russia. Thanks to some pressure from Germany and other EU member states, the Senate bill has been stopped: the German foreign minister and the Austrian chancellor said that the bill had not been coordinated with the EU and could harm the German and Austrian energy supplies from Russia

However, the EU did not trail far behind the US with its own share of ""sanctions craze."" The European Council announced on Friday that the EU would extend anti-Russian sanctions for six months more. Ukraine, from its side, though not yet a member of the European Union, has already outdone all of its European neighbors in introducing the most sophisticated sanctions against its former region of Crimea. Ukraine's president Petro Poroshenko recently announced new sanctions targeting individual sanatoriums in Crimea, there are Ukrainian sanctions aimed at seizing the property of Crimean officials in Ukraine, etc.

Cash Withdrawals Made Possible

Russia's top leadership keeps saying that Western sanctions are regrettable, but they won't make Russia give up Crimea, as Mr. Poroshenko is demanding. But how are all of these sanctions viewed ""on the ground"" — inside Crimea itself? A brief trip to Crimea in June 2017 made me understand: Crimea wants to be a part of the ""bigger world,"" but only together with Russia.

…Changes are apparent already inside the small airport in Simferopol (the capital of Crimea): unlike in 2016, it is possible to use Russian credit cards and withdraw cash using the international paying systems.

""We have been working on that and we have made cash withdrawals possible,"" said Andrei Melnikov, the minister of economic development of the Republic of Crimea — now the ""youngest"" region of the Russian Federation. ""You will feel quite at home here with your VISA or Master Card.""

The only difference from other Russian regions was that people withdrew cash not from the familiar Sberbank's green cash machines, but from the black cash machines of some other banks. Sberbank, apparently, decided not to subject itself to Western ire. Western visitors of Crimea, however, show more understanding for Crimea's plight than the EU officials.

""People who know the history of Crimea and Russia were not surprised by what happened here in 2014, when Crimea became a part of Russia again,"" explains the head of the parliamentary committee for international relations of the Republic of Cyprus, Georgios Lillikas, speaking to reporters at the recent International Economic Forum in Yalta. ""I believe sanctions are not here for duration, the problem will be resolved via political dialogue. History taught us that.""

How Did We Get There?

Crimea's history is indeed a troubled one. The Republic of Crimea, which is located on the ancient Crimean peninsula, has been a part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic inside the Soviet Union in 1954-1991 and a region inside independent Ukraine in 1991-2014. After the referendum held in the aftermath of the violent regime change in Ukraine in the early 2014, Crimea came back to Russia, whose part it had been since the 1780s. Western sanctions on companies doing business in Crimea followed instantly, with numerous other limitations. For example, foreign embassies continued viewing Crimea as still a part of Ukraine, so Crimeans had difficulty getting their visas for foreign travel. In another EU-approved move, the supposedly ""Western liberal"" Ukrainian authorities declared ""persona non grata"" any Russian artist or singer who performed or exhibited his works in ""occupied"" Crimea, sometimes extending the prohibition to visitors from third countries too.

Reactions of the People

So, people in Crimea do have some ground for comparisons — with both old and new times. And what are the voices of the people from the land — don't they want to get back to Ukraine, as the EU and the US insist they should? In order to find out the truth I talked not only to ethnic Russians, who make up a 68 percent majority of the Crimean population, but also to the local minorities — Crimean Tatars, Jews and Greeks.

""What do you think I am — an idiot? To want Crimea go back to Ukraine?"" Mikhail Degtyar, a 62 years old Crimean-born Jew and a television reporter, now sharing his time between Moscow and Crimea, is visibly emotional. ""When the so called Ukrainian activists cut all electricity supplies to Crimea in the winter of 2016, women who were giving birth at the local maternity clinics were dying because the lights went off everywhere. Am I supposed to approve that? I have nothing against the Ukrainian people, but I don't want to live under a regime where such so called popular actions are permitted to happen.""

Officially, the Ukrainian government did not approve of the actions of the ultra-right organizations which in autumn 2015 blew up the electricity lines connecting the Kherson region of Ukraine to ""energetically insufficient"" Crimea, plunging the peninsula into darkness. But the Ukrainian authorities did not do anything to remove the violent ""civic activists"" who prevented the lines from being repaired, beating and insulting the repair teams. These Ukrainian ""civic activists"" in that memorable 2015 included not only the veterans of the neo-Nazi Azov battalion and the Right Sector group, made infamous by their suppression of the population of Donbass. Electricity line poles were exploded and workers prevented from repairing them also by the activists of the Mejlis of Crimean Tatar People, an organization banned in Crimea but lionized in the West as ""the true representatives of the Crimean Tatar people.""

As a result, Crimea restored its electricity supplies only in spring 2016 thanks to the construction of ""energy bridge"" with Russia, built under President Putin's personal supervision.

Between Two Motherlands

Zaur Smirnov, currently the head of Crimea's State Committee for Interethnic Relations, was a member of the Presidium of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People when Crimea was a part of Ukraine, but he broke with that organization when it ""turned against its own people,"" in Zaur Smirnov's own words.

""I am a Crimean Tatar and I was a member of the Mejlis under Ukraine, because I wanted to serve my people,"" Zaur Smirnov said at a meeting with the members of Russia's Azerbaijani community in Simferopol, the capital of Crimea. ""But when the Mejlis tried to leave us without light and water, how could I react? When the Mejlis' leader Mustafa Djemilev started talking about sending armed kamikazes to Crimea from neighboring Ukrainian regions — what could my attitude be, except for a very negative one? If Mejlis' leaders continue considering themselves citizens of Ukraine, let them live in Ukraine. The Mejlis' top leadership — they all have homes in Ukraine, they have been for a long time living off the grants from the Western organizations which helped the ruling regime in Kiev seize power in 2014. Let them live with the regime they helped to install. I want to live in Crimea, with my people. Thanks to Crimea's reunification with Russia, the Tatar language is now one of the three state languages of Crimea (Russian, Tatar and Ukrainian). We could never get this kind of language legislation under Ukraine.""

In Ukraine, there is only one state language — Ukrainian. Russian and other minority languages are struggling for at best a regional status, which had been guaranteed to them by a special law adopted under former president Viktor Yanukovych, ousted by Maidan protest insurgency in 2014. One of the main slogans of the anti-Yanukovych protests in 2013-2014, actively supported by the US and the EU, was the cancellation of the law on regional status for minority languages. So much for Western support to language diversity.

The Good Side of Not Travelling

Most of Crimea's government members are under Western sanctions, but the head of the Republic of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, thinks that personal sanctions might also have a positive effect: the local officials, most of whom started their careers under corrupt Ukrainian presidents, are simply forced to stop thinking about foreign banks accounts and real estate in Europe. ""Instead, they will finally concentrate on making their own neighborhoods beautiful,"" said former prosecutor general of Crimea Natalya Poklonskaya, a young woman popularly considered to be the prettiest victim of Western sanctions, currently working as a Russian State Duma deputy in Moscow.

That logic might work: since 2014, not a single official in Crimea had an international search warrant issued on him after making it off with public money (a very common phenomenon in independent Ukraine). During the same period, according to Crimea's head Sergei Aksyonov, Crimean economy expanded, since the Russian-speaking peninsula was no longer discriminated against.

""When Crimea was under Ukraine, the budget of our autonomous republic was limited to 22 billion rubles ($0.37 billion) in the best of times between 1991 and 2014,"" Aksyonov said at the international forum ""Open Crimea by One's Own Eyes"" held in Crimea in mid-June 2017. ""In 2016, we collected in Crimea 40 billion rubles ($0.67) in taxes plus we get an annual investment of about $1.67 billion for our infrastructure, mostly from the federal budget of Russia.""

Industries Revived

Pretty figures do not always reflect the dire realities of individual citizens' lives, but the interviewed Crimeans seem to agree: there are definitely more employment opportunities under Russian rule, pensions and salaries grew. There are significant improvements in infrastructure: new roads, a bridge connecting the peninsula to ""continental"" Russia is being in the final stages of its construction.

""Under Ukraine, we were scrambling to make a niche for ourselves at the overseas markets, but we were still losing workplaces,"" says Alexander Batalin, the director general of the ""Fiolent"" industrial plant in Simferopol, specializing in the production of high precision industrial equipment. ""Now 90 percent of our products go to the Russian market, and we already have orders for the next year which are several times more lucrative than at any period of our life under independent Ukraine.""

According to Batalin, Fiolent set itself the aim of filling 10 percent of the Russian market of high precision machinery. ""We have to make it since the markets of Ukraine and the EU are not accessible to us,"" Batalin explains. ""But if we achieve this goal, this will allow us not only to maintain our personnel of 1.6 thousand people, but even to expand.""

Champagne for Sanctions

Alexander Zhukov, the chief specialist at Massandra winery, the famous Crimean wine-making plant whose roots date back to the tsarist times of the late 19century, also says that sanctions do not bother him as long as the Russian market stays open. ""We have 144 million people in Russia, tens of millions of them are familiar with the product of our winery, this will allow us to survive,"" Zhukov explains. ""As for more distant future, our plant and its vineyards were created in the late nineteenth century by prince Lev Golitsyn, who made wine supplies to the court of emperor Nicholas II. So, connoisseurs not only in Russia, but also abroad had the time to taste and appreciate our wines. They will want OUR wines more and more.""

When Massandra, complete with its vineyards and famous 19th century wine cellars was included in the sanctions lists of both the EU and Ukraine, Yanina Pavlenko, Massandra's director general, celebrated this fact with the introduction of a new line of sparkling wines (popularly called ""shampanskoye"" — from the French ""champagne"" — in Russian).

""I am proud to be in America's list of personal sanctions,"" Yanina Pavlenko said in an interview to RIA Novosti news agency. ""Despite all of this pressure, Massandra continues to take part in international wine competitions, and we get prizes there. This is the main thing for us. As for vacationing, I can enjoy it in Crimea. Meanwhile, California, wait for me.""

So much for the Western sanctions and their ""crippling"" effect on Russian psyche.

Speaking to local media, Zypries said the US could not punish German firms on the mere basis they were doing business with — or in — another country.

While she stressed a trade war between the two Western giants was an unwelcome prospect, she made clear Europe remains ever-ready to take ""retaliatory measures"" in response to US intransigence.

""We consider this as being against international law, plain and simple. The Americans can't punish German companies because they have business interests in another country, but unfortunately that is exactly what they are doing. That means that it is right that the European Commission now considers countermeasures,"" she said.

The latest sanctions bill will fine businesses found to be helping Moscow expand and enhance its energy export pipelines, theoretically leaving European energy firms open to harsh penalties purely for having ties to Russian firms. While President Donald Trump is yet to give his assent, former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci said July 27 Trump is certain to either sign the bill or negotiate an ""even tougher deal"" against Russia.

Of particular concern to Zypries is Nord Stream 2, a pipeline project aimed at pumping Russian natural gas to Europe via the Baltic Sea to landfall in Germany. The project is being spearheaded by Gazprom, and supported by a number of European partners including Germany's Wintershall and Austria's OMV.

As of August 1, Brussels is yet to comment on the sanctions bill, or its bearing on European energy firms, although member state leaders themselves haven't been silent.

If a trade war were to erupt, it would not be without precedent — the ""banana wars"" raged for much of the 1990s. Then, it was the US that bore a grievance, over an EU scheme that gave banana producers from former European colonies in the Caribbean special access to European markets.

Believing the deal broke free trade rules, the US filed a complaint against the EU with the World Trade Organization (WTO) and won in 1997, forcing the EU to alter its rules.

Despite the ruling, the US felt free trade in bananas had not been restored, and imposed retaliatory 100 percent import duties on European products, ranging from Scottish cashmere to French cheese. As a result, Europe's exporters were obliged to pay huge amounts to US customs simply to get their products onto the US mainland, threatening EU exports worth around US$520 million annually, and placed thousands of jobs at risk.

Moreover, almost concurrently, in 1996 the US similarly sued Brussels at the WTO over the latter's ban on hormone-treated beef. Europe upheld the ban, so the WTO authorized the US to impose punitive tariffs equal to the damage suffered because of the hormone ban.

The retaliatory tariffs had a massive impact, causing the value of EU imports affected by the duties to drop from US$130 million in 1997-98 to under US$15 million in 2008.

The dispute persists to this day, with Trump mulling 100 percent tariffs on around 90 European products, particularly agricultural products from France, Germany and Italy. However, US cross hairs are also bizarrely trained on mopeds, chocolate, mustard, paprika, chestnuts and even hair clippers.

In July, European affairs analyst Yannis Koutsomitis warned if a new trade war were to ignite, ""everyone would lose.""

""Europe is dependent on Russia in this regard, and will be for many years. If there is a disruption in cooperation between the two in the sector, it will have a huge impact on energy prices in the EU. We're facing a very delicate situation right now. We should find ways to bridge differences, rather than putting new obstacles in the way of reconciliation. The US will suffer from these sanctions as well,"" Mr. Koutsomitis previously told Sputnik."

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — Six days after the House approved an anti-Russian sanctions package on July 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on Sunday that the diplomatic presence of the United States in Russia would be cut by 755 people to 455, the same number of diplomatic personnel that Russia currently has in the US.

On Monday, Vice President Mike Pence said Trump will soon sign into law the new legislation that enhances US sanctions against Russia. It passed by overwhelming majorities of 419 to 3 in the House of Representatives and by 98 to two in the Senate.

""It should not come as a surprise that Putin decided to retaliate in kind,"" Schirach, president of the Global Policy Institute and professor of international affairs at BAU International University in Washington, said. ""Now, after Congress, by a huge margin in both houses, passed this law containing sanctions, Putin decided to get even, as he realized that these are ‘veto proof’ majorities. In other words, even if he wanted to, President Trump could not block this legislation.""

These measures revealed Washington and Moscow were already caught in a no-win cycle of escalating retaliatory measures on both sides.

""Will this huge cut affect Washington's ability to engage Russia in a meaningful way? Probably yes, even though it is not clear at this time which sectors of the bilateral relationship will be mostly affected by these significant cuts,"" he concluded.

Any hopes of improving US ties with Russia would have to wait until Trump was free of the probe by former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Robert Mueller into the president’s alleged collusion with Moscow during the 2016 presidential election campaign, Schirach acknowledged.

""Open lines of communication are a good way to prevent fatal errors. And both sides need competent diplomats in each other's capitals to keep those lines open,"" he recommended.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) — The embassy told RIA Novosti earlier in the day that the US diplomats have been denied access to a diplomatic summer house in Moscow for the past two days despite the Russian Foreign Ministry's announcement last week that the access would be suspended from August 1.

""We perceive as a deliberate provocation the US Embassy claims that it has been denied access to the summer house ahead of the deadline,"" the source told RIA Novosti.

Cargo vehicles are not allowed in the Serebryanny Bor area as it is considered a nature reserve, the source added.

""The Americans simply did not bother to inform the Moscow department of environmental protection in advance…that they were going to send three large trucks there,"" the source said.

""When the Russian Foreign Ministry urgently resolved the matter on July 31, and security staff wanted to issue permissions for [US] embassy employees to enter… the reserve, they drove away upon command,"" the source noted.

The source added that the embassy staff was expected to return on Tuesday morning but ""US diplomats continued to tell the media that they had allegedly been prevented [from entering the area].""

On Thursday, the Russian Foreign Ministry called on Washington to cut down the number of diplomats and technical staff of diplomatic missions in Russia to 455 people, on par with Russia's diplomatic representation in the United States, by September 1. It also said that from August 1, Russia would suspend the use of all warehouses in Moscow and a compound in the Serebryany Bor park by the US embassy.

On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the personnel of the US diplomatic missions in Russia would be cut by 755 people.

Russia's move came as a response to a series of measures implemented by the United States. Last week, both chambers of the US Congress approved a bill imposing new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea, as well as limiting US President Donald Trump's ability to lift the anti-Moscow restrictions.

Poland has been rocked by nationwide protests that the opposition framed as a new Solidarity movement but which was condemned by government supporters as a Soros-backed regime change operation.

The ruling Law and Justice Party, also known by its abbreviation PiS, secured the country’s first-ever parliamentary majority in the last elections, and has since embarked on a quest to reshape the country in line with its conservative values. Part of this mission involves reforming the country’s Constitutional Court to remove the judges that the Civil Platform opposition party, popularly referred to by its abbreviation PO, installed just prior to their electoral defeat. PiS understands that it must absolutely succeed in this endeavor if it’s to stand any chance at executing its long-term national vision for Poland.

It’s precisely for this reason, however, that PO marshalled tens of thousands of its supports to oppose PiS’ efforts, taking advantage of the fact that former PO leader and one-time Prime Minister Donald Tusk is now President of the European Council and is actively involved in turning liberal EU institutions against the new conservative Polish government. From the perspective of PO, its supporters, and an increasing number of influential voices in the EU, the PiS authorities in Poland are “dismantling democracy” and taking the country on the path of a “dictatorship” which they derisively compare to Hungarian leader Vikor Orban’s pro-sovereignty government. For these dramatic reasons, they also liken their current anti-government struggle to the one that their parents waged a generation ago in forming Solidarity to oppose the communists.

From the reverse perspective, however, Polish Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski accused “media conglomerates, banks and international corporations” of conspiring to stage “attempts to overthrow the government”, remarking that “the question of courts, reforms… is only an excuse.” Although not directly stated, comments such as his are usually regarded as euphemisms that George Soros and his shadowy network of “activists” are involved in one way or another, an idea which has also been floated around by others. They believe that the transnational neoliberal elite of the EU are provoking a Color Revolution scenario in the country in order to punish it for refusing to abide by Brussels’ migrant demands and other unilateral impositions of the bloc’s will.

Our final topic, picked by you, dear listeners, earlier in a poll on our Facebook page, is “China & India: Walking The Himalayan Tightrope”, focusing on the rising tensions between the two most populous countries in the world.

The high-stakes political drama between Asian giants China and India over the Donglang Plateau, also known as the Doklam Plateau, has turned the seemingly stable Himalayan region into a zone of intense Great Power competition.

China began work on modernizing an isolated road near the tri-junction of the its mountainous border with Bhutan and India in mid-June, but Bhutan regarded this Chinese-administered territory as ""disputed"" and apparently requested support from its Indian ally to stop the construction.

Incidentally, this occurred around the time that Indian Prime Minister Modi was visiting the US to meet with President Trump.

India holds a modern-day protectorate of sorts over Bhutan owing to historical circumstances and believes that it is responsible for its neighbor's defense when called upon, though China disputes the entire matter and argues that the problem is a bilateral issue between itself and Bhutan, and that India should never have gotten involved. The two nominal BRICS and SCO partners have since been engaged in a very tense standoff in the Chinese-administered territory that Beijing claims as its own, with each opposing side positioning their troops just a few meters apart from one another.

China asserts that an 1890 treaty that it signed with the UK settled the frontier between what are now the People's Republic and the independent state of India once and for all, though many Indian voices counter that neither their side nor the Bhutanese were involved in these negotiations and that the agreement is therefore illegitimate. Although official figures in Beijing and New Delhi have largely attempted to downplay the unresolved incident for now, their respective national medias have enthusiastically embraced their country's cause and made hard-hitting rhetorical cases against the other.

It's in the context of this escalating information war and ongoing standoff that Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj stated last week that ""If China unilaterally changes the status quo of the trijunction point, then that is a direct challenge to our security"", which prompted her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi to soon thereafter request that Indian forces ""conscientiously withdraw"". As the situation continues to simmer, observers are wondering how and why two supposed multipolar partners are now experiencing their worst crisis in decades and seem to startlingly be on the brink of war with one another.

Saikat Bhattacharyya, Research scholar in Economics at Jadavpur University in Kolkata, and Dong Chao, Chinese political commentator, discussed the issue.

The Trump Administration has been on a sanctions spree lately by targeting North Korea, Venezuela, Iran, and Russia in an asymmetrical show of force which fuses finance with geostrategy.

All four countries are already under differing degrees of sanctions by the US, but Trump wants to tighten the screws against each of them for various reasons. Pyongyang and Tehran have both already come under more unilateral economic restrictions by Washington due to their missile programs, while Caracas stands ready to face the wrath of the US’ financial warfare instruments due to its impending pro-democracy actions in assembling a new constituent assembly. As for Moscow, it’s been the victim of a “deep state” witch hunt for months now originating from the fake news allegations that it interfered in the US’ 2016 elections.

As a show of force, the US Congress is on the verge of passing a broad sanctions bill which will impose penalties against North Korea, Iran, and Russia, showing that these sorts of measures remain one of America’s preferred means of destabilizing its adversaries.

Sanctions have long been a tool of American foreign policy for decades, but they rarely achieve any visibly tangible dividends. More often than not, instead of toppling the governments and national elite that they’re usually directed against, they lead to unnecessary burdens and humanitarian difficulties for the vast majority of the population and their civil societies. Granted, the US believes that this tactic is useful in order to turn people against their governments, but there has yet to be a case where this policy has inarguably succeeded in the way that it was intended. It’s indeed feasible that sanctions could lead to elite infighting in some of the targeted states which destabilizes their leaderships and creates openings for Color Revolutions to succeed, though this is more wishful strategic thinking than a solidly provable concept.

In spite of the controversy surrounding them, and whether the motivation behind them is just a political fantasy or a credible long-term plot, there’s no denying the fact that sanctions still remain part and parcel of American foreign policy, and that the Trump Administration isn’t shy about wielding this asymmetrical weapon.

To discuss all these issues we are happy to be joined by Vladimir Rodzianko, managing director at The Duran, and Gordon Hahn, Senior Researcher at the Center for Terrorism and Intelligence Studies at Akribus Group, and expert at Corr Analytics.

People all over the world are protesting against globalisation, inequality and selfishness. Democratic liberalism is supposed to solve these problems, but liberalism and its big brother neoliberalism are actually the cause of these problems. Furthermore, once a country has adopted neoliberalist policies it is very hard for it ever to reject them.

Dr. Alfredo Saad Filho, from the department of Development Studies, SOAS, University of London, discusses these issues.

Dr. Filho starts the program by describing what neoliberalism is. He says that it is usually presented as a set of policies which roll back the welfare state, which endorse power for the rich. But neoliberalism has become more than that, he says. “It is a way to organize the economy, a way to organize society and the political system, around the logic of finance, the logic of extracting the maximum value that is possible from every single aspect of human interaction. This penetrates every area of social life, through privatization, through legislation attempting to force people into the labor market so that their value can be extracted from them, and so on…”

On so called ‘Liberal Democracy,’ Dr. Filho describes the international institutions which we currently have such as the UN, the IMF and informal instructions like the Davos Summit as not being very democratic. “They are inserted into the framework of global liberalism, and they have adopted the name of democracy and are institutions which serve the interests of a very small section of humanity. To call them democratic is a misdemeanor, it is not correct to say that the market can regulate these institutions. The rich can promote their own international agendas which are representative of this very small layer of humanity which runs international institutions, in order to give them legitimacy…”

The question of freedom is discussed. Dr. Filho says that liberal democracy does bring a sense of freedom: “there is freedom to trade, to make money, to accumulate profit, it is not freedom to have your human rights recognized. It is not freedom to have your basic needs satisfied.”

The process of neoliberalism of economies is discussed. Dr. Filho says: “economies change usually because of a combination of internal and external pressures. The processes can be very different. …Once you allow neoliberalism in you are changing power relations within society, you are changing the makeup of society itself, and this makes it very difficult for a reversal to occur. Once the process starts it tightens as it moves along, although it does have moments of instability and crisis as we can see today.”

Dr. Filho is somewhat optimistic because he sees that many people are realizing that neoliberalism is creating massive inequality and not solving economic problems. “Today we see two types of movements; from the left, with Bernie Sanders in the US, Corbyn in the UK and many other similar movements, and we also see a questioning of neoliberalism from the right – you see Brexit, you see Trump and others…”

The signing into law of one of three contested bills restricting the independence of Poland’s judiciary by Poland’s President, will probably result in action from Brussels. Polish critics portray the President as bowing to the will of hostile foreign powers. What are the underlying reasons for this very serious situation?

Remi Adekoya, a former political editor of the Warsaw Business Journal, and Magdalena Szmidt, a Polish lawyer and women’s rights activist participate in this program.

Remi starts off the program describing that the implications of this new law mean that the justice minister, within the first 6th months, will be able to dismiss the president of any of Poland’s lower courts (the ones that most cases are heard in), without having to give any justification. “Because some of the presidents of these lower courts are going to be afraid of losing their jobs, they might be pliant to the political wishes of the ruling party or the justice minister, plus, [after the first 6 months] because the justice minister can now appoint presidents of these courts, there is a fear that these courts will be staffed with the minister’s own people. The fear is that all of Poland’s courts under the Supreme Court will be politicized from this day on,” Remi says. Magdalena concurs: “the separation of powers in Poland has now ended.”

Why isn’t the EU doing anything?, is the next question. Magdalena says that Brussels will press for sanctions under Article 7, against Poland. “Brussels should press charges against Poland and Hungary simultaneously, striping us of our rights to vote,” she says, and continues that she does believe that the European Court of Justice will find a way to apply such disciplinary treatment. Remi describes the actual time periods and processes involved in implementing such actions, however host John Harrison raises doubts that anything will actually be done at all, given the complexity of the EU bureaucracy. Remi says that the Polish government has been abrasive in its actions, “they could have been more diplomatic,” he says, and this has upset the Brussels administration. Remi also says that “I believe the Polish government will take a step back.”

Magdalena says that the Catholic Church is now wielding too much power, and says that she thinks that the Polish government is paying the Church. The role of the Church in Polish politics is discussed. “If you want to do something, fine, but don’t force it on other people,” she says.

The involvement of the United States in this situation is touched on. “The US government has played a role in legitimizing the Polish government over the past two years… everything is being done to facilitate American investments in the energy section over the next few years… the Poles are being led to believe that a close relationship with the US is the best defense against Russia, that is what the Poles are being led to believe,” says Remi. Many other issues are discussed in this intense debate.

A theory has emerged which links the series of killings in Victorian London with the first serial killer to emerge in the United States.

Dr. Henry H. Holmes built a hotel in Chicago in time for the World's Fair, which was held in 1893.

​But the hotel was in fact a labyrinthine torture chamber and the guests would book in, but never leave.

Holmes — who was born as the rather more prosaic Herman Mudgett — confessed to killing 27 people in his ""murder castle"" and was hanged in 1896.

""I was born with the devil in me. I could not help the fact that I was a murderer, no more than the poet can help the inspiration to sing,"" wrote Holmes in his confession.

But a television documentary, broadcast in Britain on August 8, claims Holmes may have claimed more victims in England, before emigrating to the United States.

Il #nonospite di oggi è Henry Howard Holmes, nato H W Mudgett, serial killer noto come l'arcidemonio. pic.twitter.com/t4ySApad7N — Francesca Cerretani (@cespyspanish) March 8, 2017​

The American Ripper, on the History Channel, claims there are similarities between the two serial killers.

Jack The Ripper attacked his early victims — who were prostitutes — in the street, before mutilating them. But his later victims were lured back to a boarding house where he had more time to carry out his horrific mutilations.

Holmes went further, skinning and dissected his victims, before dissolving their bodies in acid.

The makers of the documentary argue that the killings in Chicago showed a maturing serial killer who had perfected his grisly techniques.

The Ripper is also known to have had skills as either a surgeon or a butcher, and they point out that Holmes was a chemist who had a medical degree from the University of Michigan.

The Ripper's victims were all killed in the Whitechapel district of east London in 1888, and the killer vanished without being caught by the police.

But the documentary makers surmised that he traveled to the US and continued his crimes in 1891.

Jeff Mudgett has been trying for years to convince the world his great-great-great-grandfather was Jack The Ripper.

He believes Scotland Yard detectives traveled to the US to investigate his ancestor.

​""There were many rumors at the time that Jack the Ripper was an American doctor… I think he committed his crimes, booked a trip home and they followed him back here. I don't know why they stopped, it could have been money,"" said Mr. Mudgett.

Mr. Mudgett says handwriting experts have confirmed that letters written by Holmes bear similarities to missives which were sent in 1888 from someone who claimed to be Jack the Ripper.

Over the years dozens of names have been suggested for the identity of Jack The Ripper, whose crimes were so notorious that in the 1970s Peter Sutcliffe, an unrelated serial killer who attacked 12 prostitutes with a hammer, was dubbed The Yorkshire Ripper.

And last year a serial killer in Inner Mongolia was dubbed the Chinese Jack The Ripper.

Among those who have put in the frame include the 19th century artist Walter Sickert, who was accused by US crime novelist Patricia Cornwell, and even author Lewis Carroll.

Several suspects have a royal connection. They include Queen Victoria's grandson, the Duke of Clarence, the royal physician Sir William Withey Gull, and Queen Victoria's surgeon, Sir John Williams, who had a practise in Whitechapel at the time.

More likely candidates for the crime are cotton merchant James Maybrick, Dorset lawyer Montague Druitt and a Polish immigrant, Seweryn Klosowski, who poisoned three of his wives and was hanged in 1903.

Another Pole, Aaron Kosminski, was suspected. He died in a lunatic asylum.

Two other suspects were Dr. Thomas Neill Cream, who was hanged for poisoning four London prostitutes with strychnine, and even Lord Randolph Churchill, the father of wartime prime minister Winston Churchill.

One theory even claimed the Ripper could have been a woman."

It seems the popular Niagara Falls is one you definitely want to steer clear of–at least whenever sewage work is being conducted.

It was a beautiful Saturday afternoon, when all of a sudden sheer horror struck flocks of tourists and business owners alike as a dark discharge invaded the area, bringing with it a putrid smell.

""I was just praying it wasn’t an oil leak,"" Pat Proctor, vice president for Rainbow Air Inc., a local helicopter tourism agency, told Buffalo News. ""It looked like something out of a sci-fi movie.""

— Maid of the Mist (@maidofthemist) July 29, 2017

​Luckily for Proctor, and dozens of others, it wasn’t an oil leak. It was a sewer discharge that came from the Niagara Falls Wastewater Treatment Plant.

Despite having the paperwork that said all signs were go on the release, it didn’t help in calming residents and owners.

""We were shocked,"" Nick Melson, a Niagara Falls city administrator, told Buffalo News. ""We were caught off guard. We had to do some digging ourselves to find out what was going on. And we were very upset that we weren’t notified.""

Not alone in their frustration, businesses like Maid of the Mist, a boating tour company, chose to vent their inquiry on Twitter.

— Maid of the Mist (@maidofthemist) July 29, 2017

​The Niagara Falls water board later explained that one of their sewage plant’s filtration basins had to be flushed out ahead of scheduled maintenance. While such events typically occur during the spring and fall, it couldn’t be avoided do to plant upgrades planned for Monday.

""We don’t normally do this during the tourist season,"" Rolfe Porter, water board executive director, told the paper.

Though the sight and smell lingered for hours it eventually dissipated overnight and was fully gone by 8:00 a.m., reported Melson.

The sewage discharge doesn’t normally change the color of the water, but Porter indicated the water had an altered color due to the sediment that was released from the bottom of the basins.

Moving forward, officials say they will work to better inform the community of any further work in the future in the hopes of easing concerns."

Recent studies in the US and the UK claim that spending time at the beach improves happiness, well-being and even mental acuity, possibly explaining why Hawaiian residents have consistently been ranked by six consecutive Gallup polls as the happiest people in America by state, according to news.com.au.

To add weight to a claim that probably needs no proving, research by Japan's Kobe University observed that those who live in a place with a view of the ocean are more relaxed than those who do not.

These ever-so-evident research results are mirrored by additional evidence posted to Sciencedirect.com, claiming that UK citizens who live by an ocean claim to have a higher quality of physical and mental health than those who live inland, particularly in deep urban enclaves.

Decades of scientific research has shown that seawater helps the physical body to fight infection, as it contains magnesium, potassium and iodine — just three of a large number of minerals that are beneficial to the human organism in moderate external doses.

As if the saltwater's balm is not enough, the sea air has long been known to provide benefits to the respiratory system that improve sleep, according to the post.

During a conversation about the positive mental and physical effects of a body's proximity to the sea, clinical psychologist Richard Shuster remarked that the relaxed calm kindled by several hours on a beach is not just due to all that sunlight-induced vitamin D, cited by NBC.

""The color blue has been found by an overwhelming amount of people to be associated with feelings of calm and peace,"" Shuster said, suggesting that staring at the ever-changing ocean causes a meditative state, shifting brain wave frequency.

The sound of ocean waves ""de-stimulates our brains,"" Shuster offered, cited by news.com.au.

As even the feeling of sand between one's toes is is well-known to be pleasurable and healthy, Shuster asserted that the oceanic calm one gains at the beach can be recreated in a meditative practice — one that only gains in value by actually being there.

""Focus on how your body feels warm from the rays of the sun,"" he said, ""focus on what it feels like to have your feet in the sand, breathe deep and smell the ocean air.""

How far are you from an ocean? Probably not so far that the benefits of being there are outweighed by the hassle of preparation, travel, and putting on all that sunscreen.

But you don't need to pay a clinical psychologist to tell you that."

Honolulu Police to Fine Those Caught Texting in a Crosswalk,[],"A pedestrian staring into the screen of a handheld device while traversing a busy street is an obvious urban deathwish, and the city of Honolulu, Hawaii, has now made this dangerous behavior a misdemeanor - with fines attached.

Intended to prevent the oblivious from becoming another statistic, the new law will go into effect in October according to local government, and fines will be leveled against those who cross ""a street or highway while viewing a mobile electronic device,"" cited by the Verge.

At a public announcement staged at one of the city's busiest intersections, Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell stated that the new law was intended to remind pedestrians to ""use common sense as they walk around this beautiful city,"" as well as making sure that ""they don't become another statistic.""

""We hold the unfortunate distinction of being a major city with more pedestrians being hit in crosswalks, particularly our seniors, than almost any other city in the county,"" Caldwell said.

According to a University of Maryland study, between 2000-2011 more than 11,000 people in the US sustained injuries as a direct result of being distracted by a handheld device while walking.

The tropical island city is now the largest urban center in the US to implement laws against being distracted in crosswalks by devices, including cell phones, text messaging devices, pagers, PDAs, laptops, video games or cameras, according to the Verge.

The new law, which goes into effect October 25, will see fines of $15-$35 for a first offense, $35-$75 if a second offense occurs within a year, and $75-$99 for a third time within that same year.

The practice of listening to audio devices is exempt from the ban, as are those who can prove that they were making a telephone call to emergency services at the time of their citation.

As with many other states, Hawaii also has banned the use of handheld devices while operating a motor vehicle.

Those complaining of lawmaker overreach have criticized the new bill.

According to a recent editorial in The Star, legislators involved in crafting and passing the bill were depicted as ""exasperated parents telling foolish children to not do stupid things that tempt death,"" adding that human stupidity is omnipresent, with or without laws."

Deep in the Negev Desert in southern Israel a large commercial greenhouse posing as a tomato farm was actually growing a much more profitable product — marijuana. Police spent over 24 hours digging up the vast number of plants following the seizure of the facility, according to Jerusalem Online.

An estimated 13,500 living plants were uprooted and destroyed according to reports, in what has been described as one of the largest seizures of living marijuana plants — a substance recently decriminalized in Israel — in recent memory.

The seizure, on one of the many communal farming communities in the country, is predicted to bring about a shortage of the popular recreational substance, according to an assertion by an unnamed police spokesperson, cited by Jerusalem Online.

The comparative size of the haul — when balanced against the size of the country — had officials breathlessly estimating its street value at some $25 million.

Those responsible for growing what is increasingly noted by prominent medical researchers around the globe as a relatively benign material, are now the subject of a manhunt, according to Israeli police.

Although the growers managed to avoid capture, police in Israel noted that the ongoing campaign to remove the business of marijuana growing and distribution from the nation's culture would continue.

On March 5 of this year the public consumption of marijuana was decriminalized in Israel. First-time offenders will be fined $270 and four-time offenders will receive jail time.

Selling or growing pot in the country remains a criminal offense, however."

MEXICO CITY (Sputnik)According to the National Electoral Council, the voter turnout was just over 41.5 percent. However, after publishing photos of empty polling stations throughout the day, the country's opposition is now disputing the figure. Maduro's opponents suggest that only about 10 percent of voters came out to cast their ballots.

Months of protests that began in April have left more than 100 people dead. According to the country's Public Prosecutor's office, the investigation is underway into the deaths of 10 people during the Sunday rallies. And while protest rallies had been officially prohibited before the vote, this did not stop the demonstrators.

Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro convened the Constituent Assembly to restore peace in a beleaguered country, but the opposition fears that a new legislative body would only serve to solidify the current government's hold onto power.

The opposition staged strikes on Wednesday and Thursday. The day of the vote itself was marred by violent clashes between protesters and the police. A grenade explosion at a polling station in the city of Valle De La Pascua left six people injured.

The 545-member Constituent Assembly will be able to start working as soon as on Wednesday. Maduro said on Sunday that one of the first things that had to be done would be reforming the country's public prosecutor's office. Venezuelan Attorney General Luisa Ortega Diaz emerged as a critic of the government. In the run-up to the election, Ortega Diaz said that the administration was violating the constitution, and that the Sunday vote would present a choice between continued existence or the establishment of a totalitarian system. Ortega Diaz herself is currently under an administrative investigation for abusing her position as attorney general.

Henrique Capriles Radonski, the governor of the state of Miranda and a senior opposition leader, reportedly said on Sunday the vote was ""fraudulent."" The Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD) opposition coalition announced new protests earlier in the day on Twitter, while the Peruvian Foreign Ministry said it would call an emergency meeting of American nations, expected to be held on August 8.

Caracas said in April it would be withdrawing from the Organization of American States. Its membership of a sub-regional Mercosur trade bloc has been suspended since December, and the member states are reportedly considering Venezuela's expulsion. A number of countries in the region have sharply criticized Caracas, starting from April, when the Venezuela's top court made a decision to curb the powers of the National Assembly, which triggered a wave of protests that did not subside even as the decision was later reversed.

The United States has promised to impose economic sanctions on Venezuela if it proceeded with the Constitutional Assembly. The sanctions might reportedly target the oil sector, which has the potential to hurt an already struggling economy. The Venezuelan government largely relied on revenues from oil, its major export, to fund social programs. However, the plunging oil prices rattled the country's economy, which reportedly led to food and medicine shortages.

Maduro immediately dismissed the US warning of sanctions and emphatically reinstated his position at a rally on Sunday, saying that the Venezuelan government was interested in what its people had to say rather than the opinion of US President Donald Trump."

© REUTERS/ Mike Blake Trump Border Wall Prototypes to Be Built This Summer in San Diego

Introduced on Thursday by Texas Republican Representative Will Hurd, whose district includes over 800 miles of the US-Mexico border, the Secure Miles with All Resources and Technology, or SMARTAct, is co-sponsored by representatives from border states California, New Mexico and Texas, as well as Pennsylvania.

The bill would direct the Department of Homeland Security to build a network of sensors, drones and fiber optics to monitor the border and protect the country from unwanted immigrants and contraband. Hurd said in a statement that the smart wall could be “fully operational within a year,” according to Nextgov, and would improve border protections and save taxpayers money.

“Violent drug cartels are using more modern technology to breach our border than what we are using to secure it,” Hurd explained.

On the campaign trail ahead of the 2016 presidential election, Trump bluntly called Mexican immigrants “rapists” and claimed that they brought drugs and crime across the border. The statements outraged many in the US. He insisted he would stem the flow of undocumented immigrants by building a wall along the US-Mexican border and force the Mexican government to pay the construction expenses. Mexico has denied it will do so.

“[Rather] than building walls to meet campaign promises, [the SMARTAct] takes a measured approach by directing DHS, in conjunction with state and local agencies” to determine what technologies could better be used to secure the border, according to Texas Democrat Henry Cuellar, one of the bill’s co-sponsors.

“A giant wall is nothing more than a 14th Century solution to a 21st Century problem,” he added.

The US Border Patrol’s acting Chief Scott Luck testified last week at a House of Representatives subcommittee hearing that a combination of technology, physical barriers and trained professionals would be needed to secure the US border with Mexico.

Ideally, a border control system would be put in place whereby information could be “shared immediately to all components and agents and officers who need it,” Luck said.

As far as technology goes, Hurd has reportedly been tapping the expertise of Anduril Industries, a Silicon Valley defense tech firm founded by virtual reality entrepreneur Palmer Luckey, who also founded Oculus VR, CNN reported. The proposal estimates the smart wall will cost — at most — $500,000 per mile, considerably less than the $24.5 million per mile requested by the government for border security for fiscal year 2018."

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — Six days after the House approved an anti-Russian sanctions package on July 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on Sunday that the diplomatic presence of the United States in Russia would be cut by 755 people to 455, the same number of diplomatic personnel that Russia currently has in the US.

On Monday, Vice President Mike Pence said Trump will soon sign into law the new legislation that enhances US sanctions against Russia. It passed by overwhelming majorities of 419 to 3 in the House of Representatives and by 98 to two in the Senate.

RUSSIA’S LEGITIMATE GRIEVANCES

The diplomatic climate between the two thermonuclear superpowers was likely to deteriorate further, Eurasian Business Coalition Vice President Ralph Winnie warned in an interview.

""I was not surprised Russia would retaliate in this fashion,"" he said.

Moscow had been angered by the repeated accusations from US politicians and media that Russia had allegedly intervened to try and influence the 2016 presidential election, Winnie recalled.

""They have been very vocal about how they feel that they have been singled out unfairly over sanctions by Congress and by the allegation that they intervened in the US election,"" he said.

Trump still had a window of opportunity to avoid a further deterioration in relations with Moscow if he defied congressional pressure and refused to sign the sanctions legislation, Winnie stated.

""A lot depends on what Trump does next,"" he said.

However, if Trump goes ahead and signs the bill, as Pence has said he will, then Russia could be expected to take other retaliatory measures, angering US hawks even more, Winnie warned.

""If Trump signs the bill, it is likely that there will be more consequences,"" he said.

Jon Huntsman, Trump’s choice as next US ambassador to Moscow has held high level diplomatic positions and also has had extensive experience of doing business with Russia, but he will need all of his tact and skill to try and retain and repair good relations between the two governments, Winnie cautioned.

""Huntsman will have his work cut out to smooth out relations between the United States and Russia,"" he said.

Author and political activist David Swanson suggested that the Moscow government had ordered the cuts in US diplomatic personnel out of increasing anger at the escalating barrage of accusation and hostile measures from the US legislature and government, regardless of Russian peace efforts.

""President Putin said he was frustrated and losing patience. He also characterized US sanctions as being — like US war making and war threats — violations of law,"" Swanson said.

Swanson said the US government needed to be held accountable for its activities in countries ranging from Syria and Libya to Ukraine in an international court of law.

""I wish that Russia and the world would, with the help of responsible US residents, pursue the application of law to US aggression through the World Court and the ICC [International Criminal Court],"" he said.

Washington and Moscow risked getting caught up in a negative cycle of diplomatic and economic measures and retaliation, Swanson cautioned.

""Countermeasures are understandable but do indeed risk a cycle of escalation,"" he advised.

However, the ultimate target of US policy could turn out to be not Russia but Iran, Swanson warned.

""I think we all are in danger of losing focus on the likelihood that the primary victim of the latest sanctions and threats may turn out to be Iran, and all of this may be a prelude to the all-out destruction of that country,"" he concluded.

The new US legislation imposed additional sanctions on Iran and North Korea as well as on Russia.

The bill also states that it is the US policy to secure Ukrainian energy dependence, to promote a non-Russian energy sources throughout Western Europe, and forces the National Security Council to include the Secretary of the Treasury."

The region is rich in natural resources but requires more infrastructure building for deeper economic integration and to boost exports. Asian companies are likely to cash in. Tom McGregor takes a closer look.

By Tom McGregor, CCTV.com Panview commentator and editor based in Beijing

There's more to Russia than oil and gas, and with Western governments imposing harsh sanctions on Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin has touted a look to the Far East proposal.

By cutting taxes and opening doors for foreign direct investments (FDI) in the country's Far East, which borders China, Mongolia, the Korean Peninsula and is in close proximity to Japan, Russia will be able to enjoy higher annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates again.

The Far East covers more than 6 million square kilometers of territory, but is sparsely populated with 6.2 million people, many of them based in the western coast port city of Vladivostok. The region holds an abundance of untapped reserves of natural resources, while rich in agriculture and fisheries.

Unleashing the Benefits

""The Far East shares a border with some of the most dynamically developing economies in the world,"" Russian Minister for Development of the Far East Alexander Galushka told the Asia Times. ""It's key for us to harness that economic power for the benefit of developing our eastern territories.""

Moscow has set up special economic zones and renovated the Free Port of Vladivostok to streamline trade flow between Russia and Asian markets.

Asian miners can explore huge deposits of gold and silver, along with 70 types of ore, such as zinc, coal, iron, titanium, platinum and manganese.

Nonetheless, the major moneymaker for the region remains oil and gas that can be found in the Sakhalin fields. Russian plans to boost liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports to Asian countries.

In the Sakhalin-3 oil and gas project, Japan's Mitsui has just invested over $1 billion. to add a third production line to the Sakhalin-2 LNG plant, which is scheduled to go online by 2021.

Russian oil and gas companies have built mega pipeline networks to export fossil fuels to China as well.

Feeding Its Neighbors

""In the Far East today, more than 500 projects are in the implementation stage with plans for another 300 and when we look at these projects we see that the most popular with investors is agriculture, not mining,"" said Leonid Peluhkov, director-general of the Far East for Attracting Investments and Supporting Exports.

Asian countries have enjoyed remarkable economic growth rates with rapid industrialization and urbanization. Such measures have helped hundreds of millions of Chinese and Asians escape poverty, since many have migrated to cities for higher-paying jobs.

Nonetheless, many farming families had departed from their lands, which means China and other Asian countries can no longer feed themselves. Each year, China imports about $250 million worth of foodstuffs.

Ironically, Western-imposed sanctions have forced Russian agriculture to reform, so there's a larger supply of livestock, dairy and crops, not only to feed the country but also to be exported abroad without inflicting increased inflationary pressures.

Russian farmers are producing soybean, corn, wheat, rice and rapeseed, as well dairy and meat for Asian consumers.

Last September, Moscow and Beijing had set up a $10 billion agricultural fund, mainly funded by Chinese capital, to upgrade logistics on imports to China and to ensure stronger food safety standards for Chinese buyers.

Building Transport Corridors

""We've attracted $37 billion of private investment to the region, but this is not a one-off action,"" said Galushka. ""We plan to keep going and by the end of 2017 accumulate a total of $67 billion in private investments.""

Sounds optimistic, but there's still a significant challenge. Much of the Far East stands isolated with few roads and logistics centers after minerals get extracted, timber — ready for shipment and foodstuffs — set for delivery.

China's One Belt One Road can help. Beijing has pledged to invest in the construction of massive infrastructure projects to jump-start cross-border trade and investments with member states.

Russia was one of the first countries to enroll, as they have upgraded customs on the border to make trade between the two countries more efficient.

China was one of the first supporters of the Far East, launching 23 new projects in farming manufacturing, energy, transportation, logistics and hotel construction.

Meanwhile Japanese firms have tapped in to Russian energy projects, including coal and have ushered in high-tech innovations for Russia's manufacturing sector.

Open Spaces, Open Opportunities

Russia's Far East can lead to riches for Asian companies but it won't happen overnight. To tap into its natural resources, including agriculture and fisheries, much groundwork lies ahead.

Asian companies have already played a pivotal role to urbanize the continent and perhaps the Far East needs some urbanization too for the proposal to succeed.

By constructing more logistics hubs, economic corridors, energy zones and trading ports in the sparsely-populated region, such activities would encourage more Asian investors to move in and score bigger profits in the long term.

© Sputnik/ Sergey Guneev Not Again! Russians Allegedly Targeted Macron Campaign Staff on Facebook

PARIS (Sputnik) — A survey carried out by IFOP pollster and published by Le Journal du Dimanche last week showed that the percentage of those who were ""very satisfied"" with Macron’s presidency dropped from 64 percent seen in June to 54 percent. The pollster said that this constituted an almost unprecedented popularity drop, with the exception of Jacques Chirac losing 15 percentage points between May and July 1995.

UNPOPULAR ECONOMIC MEASURES

Alain Policar, a political philosopher at the French university Sciences Po, told Sputnik that Macron’s popularity dropped because the French were beginning to get a clearer picture of the government’s plans and could see that its policies were not ""progressive"" in terms of the economy.

""We now better understand the project of this government, and we understand that if it is liberal in the American way in terms of customs, meaning rather progressive, it is certainly not that as far as the economy is concerned. For example, there is another measure – the considerable budget cuts in the research sphere, health, etc.; there was a lack of transparency in the dispute with the army chief of staff, and the constraint resignation of the latter,"" Policar explained.

Gen. Pierre de Villiers, the French army’s chief of staff, resigned on July 19 over a disagreement on budget cuts previewed for the military. Earlier in July, Macron told Le Journal du Dimanche that if the army's chief of staff and the president of France find themselves in disagreement, it is the army chief of staff that should give in.

The expert said that Macron’s policy was ""from the economic point of view totally liberal in the French, European sense, not the American one, meaning the politics, which is looking to deregulate the market and remove the protection that the workers and the state employees can have.""

Daniel Boy, a senior researcher at a political science research center CEVIPOF, also suggested that Macron’s ""unpopular economic measures"" were behind the sudden decrease of Macron’s popularity among the French.

""All the highly unpopular economic measures plus the start like that quickly erases the popularity. There is also no state of grace for the economic measures, put in place in the first three months, which was very rapid,"" Boy pointed out.

The expert said that the anti-terror law, aiming to codify some elements of the state of emergency and make them part of the general law, was criticized less directly than the economic measures because its consequences were more difficult to understand.

The draft of the anti-terror law was adopted by the Senate last week and will be discussed in the National Assembly in the fall.

The low turnout at June’s legislative elections may also be behind the decrease of Macron’s popularity meaning that the president could count on limited support, Boy suggested.

""First major reason [for popularity drop] is that Emmanuel Macron got the presidency in a comfortable way, but there was a 50% abstention in the legislative election. So we come to understand that what was missing in this election is the working class, the young people whose abstention was enormous. So the election circle on which Macron’s presidency leans is very weak,"" Boy pointed out.

La Republique en Marche, the party founded by Macron, won over 300 seats in a 577-member National Assembly at the elections held in June.

Boy added that the so-called ""grace period,"" a short period of general satisfaction following the transition to a new administration, has been growing shorter in France as the electorate has been becoming increasingly impatient, ""demanding the result.""

Policar said that the current government restricted its communications policy in attempt to control what the media said.

""The communication of this government is completely restricted. They select journalists, they want to have full control over what’s being said and that I think is playing against him. All that makes him progressive is contradicted by the strictly controlled communication. And this is what’s surprising in the eyes of many,"" Policar said.

The expert noted that the French seemed to be dealing with a president who was more authoritarian than he initially appeared.

""We have an authoritarian president who doesn’t not delegate much, who is certainly drunk with success of his unprecedented and unpredictable political performance, with a simple watchword … We have an impression to be dealing with someone more authoritarian than he looked. I think the French people start opening the eyes regarding Macron’s personality,"" Policar said.

Boy also said that Macron seemed authoritarian.

""It’s the president who rules, who does not explain himself much on the television. In France we have a system that is a bit of a monarchy, everything depends on the personality of that who occupies this office,"" Boy said.

Boy said that Macron’s future approval ratings would depend on his communication policy and on the state of the French economy.

""I think Macron’s popularity will continue to drop, it also depends on the moment when he will choose to have a communication policy to catch up on this, which is not easy since he chose a very narrow way of communication. But also it depends on the economic indicators,"" Boy said.

The expert added that new unemployment statistics would be revealed soon and the president may be seen as responsible for them even if technically it would not be so.

According to Boy, economy was a dominant issue in France and Macron’s popularity would continue to decrease if there were no improvements by the end of the year."

© AP Photo/ Ronald Zak Austrian Chancellor Says New US Sanctions Against Russia 'Unacceptable'

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — The sanctions contained within the new bill, which passed the House by a vote of 419 to 4 earlier this week, targets Russia's defense, intelligence, mining, shipping and railway industries, and restrict dealings with Russian banks and energy companies.

European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker warned the EU College of Commissioners that if the Union’s own energy security interests were not taken into account, Brussels was prepared to take measures of its own in matter of days rather than weeks. Junker also served notice the proposed legislation was intended to put the United States first and could not be allowed to significantly harm the EU nations as a side-effect.

The proposed US legislation is also expected to damage the agreement to build the $10.6 billion North Stream 2 gas pipeline. In April 2017, Russia’s state Gazprom Corporation signed an agreement to move ahead with the giant project with French Engie, Royal Dutch Shell, OMV of Austria and the Germany Uniper and Wintershall companies.

EU RESISTANCE

France and Germany have both spoken out against the proposed new sanctions, which would including penalizing European individuals and companies in a so-called ""secondary"" boycott for doing business with Russia and Iran.

""The EU, especially Western Europeans, have made it clear that will not accept a secondary boycott — proscribed by international law,"" University of Pittsburgh Professor of International Affairs Michael Brenner told Sputnik.

The French Foreign Ministry stated that the measure passed by both chambers of Congress would be illegal under international law even if President Donald Trump signed it, or if it was repassed by both chambers with two-thirds majorities over Trump’s veto.

Noted political commentator, philosopher and University of Louvain Professor Jean Bricmont cautioned that the mounting chorus of criticism against the measure from European leaders clearly indicated it would provoke serious clashes with the United States if it was imposed.

""Sometimes… something has to give: the Europeans are upset with the sanctions; there is even a report of the French National Assembly on the extraterritorial nature of US decisions,"" he recalled.

© AFP 2017/ SAUL LOEB Wall Street Analyst: Sanctions on Russia Part of US Plan to Seek Global Energy Domination

European opinion makers and politicians still feared to stand up to the United States even to defend their own interests since the end of the Cold War, Bricmont noted.

""Our problem is ideological: because of its ‘victory’ in the Cold War, the US has an immense prestige among the European intellectuals and politicians that make it difficult to take ‘anti-American’ measures… even if it would be in Europe’s interests,"" he explained.

Therefore even many leaders who recognized the damage that the new US sanctions against Russia would inflict on EU member states did not dare to say so because they feared angering established interests and powers in Washington, Bricmont pointed out.

""Those opposed to the general confrontational stance will remain silent for fear of provoking the Beast in Washington,"" he said.

US politicians who supported the intensified sanctions on Russia were listening to the same confrontational hawks who had led the United States to failed policies and disaster in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Ukraine, Afghanistan and other theaters, Bricmont recalled.

""It is amazing that those guys who have been wrong about pretty much everything, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Ukraine, Russia and that make the US almost universally hated, and still in charge. This may be the real ‘decline of the West,’"" he declared.

The sanctions are not expected to harm major economic interests in the United States because US-Russian bilateral trade already declined precipitously under previous President Barack Obama reaching only $38.1 billion in 2013. However, the European Union still enjoyed a total trade volume worth $213 billion in 2016 although even that was seriously down from $378 billion in 2013."

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — They gave their assessments after US Special Operations Command head Raymond Thomas told at a security forum last week that Russia can challenge legality of the US military presence in Syria.

US ROLE IN SYRIA VIOLATES UN CHARTER

""The United States military intervention into Syria without the permission of the Syrian government clearly violates the United Nations Charter and the Nuremberg Charter, Judgement and Principles,"" University of Illinois Professor of International Law Francis Boyle told Sputnik on Monday.

The intervention also violated US Army Field Manual 27-10 (1956) on The Law of Land Warfare, Boyle pointed out.

Last week, US media reports stated that President Donald Trump had decided to end a four year CIA military training program costing half a billion dollars a year to train the military forces of Syrian opposition groups seeking to topple the Damascus government.

These groups had been claimed to be moderate and secular but in reality they were dominated by violent, extremist Islamist groups, most notably the Nusra Front, the Syrian franchise of al-Qaeda.

By contrast, the Russian military presence in Syria had been invited by the legal government and was in accord with the principles of international law, Boyle observed.

""Russia is in Syria at the request of the Syrian government, which makes it lawful under international law,"" he said.

Russia had the legal right to sue the United States under international law but this would not change anything in practice because based on previous such attempts, the US government would simply ignore any judgement against it, Boyle noted.

""For Russia to sue the United States at the International Court of Justice over this would be a total waste of time,"" he said.

When Nicaragua did the exact same thing against the Reagan administration, the US government violated the World Court’s 1984 Temporary Restraining Order, Boyle recalled.

On that occasion, the Reagan administration violated the World Court’s Final Judgement on the Merits for Nicaragua and against the United States, Boyle stated.

The US government also ""vetoed Nicaragua’s attempt to enforce the World Court’s Judgement at the United Nations Security Council, and refused to pay Nicaragua even one Yankee Cent in damages,"" he continued.

The same principles that led the World Court to find against the United States and in favour of Nicaragua in 1984 would also apply now if Syria or Russia sought to take legal action against the US intervention in Syria, Boyle explained.

""If you read the World Court’s 1986 Judgement in the Nicaragua Case, all you have to do is substitute Syria for Nicaragua and ‘jihadis’ for ‘contras’ to reach the exact same conclusions of gross illegality,"" he remarked.

Both Russia and Syria would prevail against the United States at the International Court of Justice, Boyle concluded.

Critics have attacked Trump for unilaterally choosing to shut down the CIA training program instead of trying to leverage it to force concessions from Russia.

However, supporters of the decision have pointed out that the program had been wasting hundreds of millions of dollars per year and that it had been long criticized for its ineffectiveness and lack of accountability by many senior US military and intelligence officers.

Retired United Kingdom Foreign Office official Jonathan Clarke agreed that the Trump administration was unlikely to be swayed in its policy-making on Syria if any judgement from the World Court or other international legal body found Washington to be in breach of international law on the issue.

Clarke told Sputnik that he was ""not convinced that this is an administration for which legal compliance is paramount.""

General Thomas in his comments on Friday noted that the stated reasoning for the US presence in Syria was to fight the Islamic State terrorist group (banned in Russia) and other terrorist groups, not the government of President Bashar Assad.

If the Russians presented the legal case against the continued US military presence in Syria US leaders might still want to stay but find they had no ability to do it, Thomas suggested.

The US-led coalition of now more than 70 member states has been conducting airstrikes in Syria since 2014."

However, Sam Husseini, an independent writer based in Washington and the founder of VotePact.org said the drama, which dominated the news cycle in the US media on Friday served just to further distract the American public from the collapse of US efforts to try and topple the government of Syria.

""Trump provides the establishment with drama after drama: This functions as a massive distraction from actual policy questions,"" he said. ""Syria is likely being carved up with possibly horrific consequences.""

VotePact.org works to provide voters with a path out of the duopoly

Trump’s decision to end financing rebel groups in Syria seeking to overthrow the legitimate government of President Bashar Assad now carried the risk of ""blowback"" as some of those groups could use their US-supplied weapons and training to attack Americans in retaliation, Husseini warned.

""What will CIA funded rebels do now? Possibly what Mujahideen [in Afghanistan] did decades ago: turn on the US,"" he suggested.

The controversy over the White House press and communications staff also served to distract the US public as well as policymakers from the growing tensions in Jerusalem, where Israeli security forces had cracked down on Muslim activities at the sacred al-Aqsa mosque, Husseini warned.

""What's happening now at al-Aqsa?"" he asked.

Also, in their obsession with Trump’s media team reshuffle, both the US media and politicians in Congress were failing to scrutinize the past record of Christopher Wray’s, Trump selection as the next director of the federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Husseini pointed out.

""The FBI nominee, Christopher Wray, is sailing through though he seems on board with all manner of unconstitutional conduct, since all the Democrats in Congress seem really concerned about is alleged Trump wrongdoing with regard to Russia,"" Husseini said.

The failure to adequately scrutinize Wray, and the failure of US policies across the Middle East gave Trump a much greater window of opportunity to win approval for even more dangerous and rash policies after any a possible future provocation, Husseini feared.

""This drama could all be noise untill the next 9/11 happens so that the US establishment can get its mojo back and kill on a level befitting its ambitions,"" he said.

SPICER’S BUNGLES MAKE SCARAMUCCI LOOK GOOD

Some critics have praised Scaramucci for his first interaction with the media on Friday after his appointment as White House c director of communications.

However, Sue Udry, executive director of Defending Rights and Dissent, a national civil liberties organization cautioned that Scaramucci had enjoyed an easy challenge because Spicer had bungled media outreach and relations with the press so badly during Trump’s first six months on office.

The White House press office ""has been a disgrace thus far,"" she told Sputnik.

Spicer was mocked and criticized over his controversial remark comparing Syrian President Bashar Assad and Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler.

Trump's choice of Scaramucci was reportedly backed by his son-in-low and adviser Jared Kushner, daughter Ivanka and Wilbur Ross, the Commerce Secretary.

White House chief of staff Reince Priebus opposed the move because of Scaramucci's insufficient political experience, the New York Times said.

Scaramucci, 53 is an American entrepreneur, financier, political figure, and author. In June 2017 he became a senior vice president and chief strategy officer at the US Export-Import Bank. Following the 2016 election, he served on Trump’s Presidential Transition Team Executive Committee.

From 1989 to 1996 Scaramucci held senior positions at the Goldman Sachs investment firm on Wall Street. In 2005, he founded the global investment firm SkyBridge Capital and sold the company in early 2017 to take a role in the Trump administration."

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — The move was widely reported in the US media on Wednesday with no denials and has been universally accepted as taking place.

Trump reportedly decided to halt the training about a month ago, after a meeting with CIA Director Mike Pompeo and national security adviser H.R. McMaster, which preceded his talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany earlier this month.

SCRAPPING CIA TRAINING PROGRAM OPENS WAY FOR PEACE DEAL IN SYRIA

© AFP 2017/ BARAA AL-HALABI Moscow Comments Reports of CIA Halting Syrian Rebels' Training Program

The CIA program’s goal was to train at least 5,400 allegedly non-Islamist rebels in an armed force to fight Daesh terror group (outlawed in Russia), while also opposing the legitimate Syrian government of President Bashar Assad.

""This decision opens the door noticeably wider for a negotiated resolution of the dire political conflict (and resulting humanitarian catastrophe) inside Syria,"" historian and Middle East analyst Helena Cobban, a leading expert on Syria, said on Thursday.

Continued US support for the rebel groups, some of which were extreme Islamists, had effectively blocked any moves in the past to end the conflict in Syria that has lasted nearly six-and-a-half years and cost more than 600,000 lives, Cobban explained.

""So long as the United States’ covert-action teams were working hand-in-glove with the forces working tirelessly to overthrow the government of Syria, it was hard to envision the United States also sitting down with those political forces inside and outside the country who seek a negotiated resolution,"" she said.

However, Trump’s decision to end the CIA support program breathed new life into the Syrian peace process, Cobban observed.

The problems plaguing massive US military aid and training for the rebels greatly embarrassed previous President Barack Obama. Senior US officers have testified to Congress that an undetermined number of such rebels have disappeared with US military equipment and actually joined Islamist forces, including Daesh.

On September 16, 2015, then CENTCOM commanding General Lloyd Austin told the US Senate Armed Services Committee that half a billion dollars of funding for military training of Syrian rebels approved by Congress had only produced only four or five opposition troops in the field by that point.

The CIA training and support program for the rebels failed to accomplish any constructive goals, but only spread and intensified the sufferings of ordinary people in Syria, Cobban recalled.

""The CIA's aid to the Syrian ‘rebels’ prolonged and deepened the suffering of Syria's people throughout the whole of the past six years,"" she said.

The real purpose of the program was not to defeat Daesh, but to topple the legitimate Syrian government of President Bashar Assad, Cobban stated.

The Obama administration added to the CIA program a ""very bright green light… to other non-Syrian actors working to overthrow Syria's legitimate government, like the Saudi and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Turkey… and jihadis from all around the world,"" she said.

However, a series of policy shifts by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the clash in the GCC between Qatar and other member states backed by Saudi Arabia looked likely to distract these previous support sources for the Syrian rebels, Cobban observed.

""With the Turkish government now acting a lot more pragmatically than before, and with the ongoing chaos among the GCC countries, it can be hoped that… groups who supported regime change in Syria will now… die of their own accord,"" she said.

The end of CIA training for Syrian rebels was also likely to give a boost to cooperation between governments and other forces in the region that genuinely opposed the Islamic State and other Islamist terror groups, Cobban noted.

Rebels seeking regime change in Damascus were now more likely to ""be quashed through the cooperation of all the sincerely anti-jihadi forces in the region. There is still a lot of diplomatic work to do, but this decision from Washington makes it seem at least more possible,"" she concluded.

CIA PROGRAM SHOWED 5-YEAR RECORD OF CONSISTANT FAILURES

Trump’s decision to terminate the CIA program has been interpreted by analysts as an acknowledgment that the five-year-old program has totally failed to achieve any of its goals, caused damage to US credibility and was not capable of being reformed.

Author and political activist David Swanson said Trump’s decision to end the CIA training program was a long-belated acknowledgment of its complete failure to produce any significant moderate rebel fighting force, while many recruits actually joined the Islamic State or other Islamist groups.

Swanson said the decision to scrap the rebel military training program expressed ""a recognition of reality.""

Previous president Barack Obama had been praised as an alleged moderate and technocrat, yet he had ignored his own best intelligence assessments to launch a costly the costly CIA training program after being given due warning that it would not work, Swanson recalled.

""When Obama was president he had the CIA produce a study on whether aiding proxy forces had ever succeeded on its own terms. The answer was no, yet Obama, the supposedly intelligent technocrat went ahead and did exactly what the study had found would not work,"" he said.

Trump’s decision to end the CIA training program was rational and sensible, but came as a surprise because US policies in the Middle East and especially on Syria had not been guided by such considerations, Swanson observed.

""Ending it after years of predictable and predicted failure is only hard to explain because we have come to expect completely illogical madness,"" he said.

Trump may also have scrapped the program as part of some quid pro quo arrangement he had negotiated with Putin at their G20 meeting, Swanson noted.

The decision to end the CIA training could indicate ""some deal struck between Trump and Putin, but since neither of them is likely to tell us, we are left to speculate,"" he said.

Although Trump had ordered the end of the training program, it remained to be seen whether he could ensure that the US armed forces and the CIA obeyed his orders and actually enforced the decision, Swanson cautioned.

""The decision is a good one on its own terms if it's real. But what goes with it remains to be seen — including whether the US military and CIA actually comply with it,"" he warned.

Swanson assessed that the results of the CIA training program had been entirely disastrous.

It had only produced ""massive death and suffering, militarization of a region, fueling of hatred and hostility and terrorism for years to come,"" he concluded.

The CIA reportedly maintained its program to provide weapons to Syrian opposition fighters since 2012. However, the private intelligence firm Soufran Group noted in a report on Thursday that the training program was ineffective and problematic since its launch."

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — The contacts between Washington and Havana on the matters like migration and drug trafficking will likely be postponed under the administration of US President Donald Trump, while the cultural and scientific exchanges may continue, Director of Cuban Research Institute at Florida International Institute Jorge Duany told Sputnik.

""It appears that high-level contacts between the US and Cuban governments have already stalled, compared to the last two years of the Obama administration,"" Duany said. ""Some of the initial exchanges regarding drug trafficking, human smuggling, environmental issues, and migration may be put on hold by the Trump administration. The educational, scientific, and cultural exchanges facilitated by Obama might still continue under the Trump era.""

Duany noted that although the US and Cuban governments have expressed a desire to continue a dialogue on issues of mutual interest, the atmosphere for these conversations seems ""more charged than during the last term of the Obama presidency.""

""At least rhetorically, the two governments seem to have returned to their entrenched Cold War positions before December 17, 2014,"" he stated.

Thursday marks the second anniversary of the official restoration of diplomatic relations between Washington and Havana after more than 50 years of severed ties. The warming of relations came as a result of then President Barack Obama’s decision in December 2014 to pursue a path toward normalizing relations with Cuba.

In June, however, US President Donald Trump announced his administration would roll back Obama's efforts to re-establish ties with Cuba. Trump said there would be new business and travel restrictions imposed on Havana, and Washington will retain the existing embargo.

Duany believes that it's difficult to foresee any major advances in US- Cuba relations, as long as the Cuban government continues to make claims such as the return of Guantanamo Bay naval base or the repeal of the Cuban Adjustment Act, and the US government insists that Cuba should hold free elections and legalize all political parties.

""The Trump administration is currently involved in spelling out how the presidential directive signed on June 16 will be implemented by various US government agencies, such as the departments of the Treasury and Commerce,"" Duany noted. ""It is crucial that the new regulations clarify just how the prohibitions against dealing with entities controlled by the Cuban armed forces or individual people-to-people travel will be put into practice.""

The director noted that while at this point, it remains unclear whether Trump’s partial reversal of Obama’s policies toward Cuba will affect the fledgling private sector of the Cuban economy.

""Should the number of US travelers to Cuba be reduced, many small businesses related to the tourist industry on the Island could be hurt by a decreased demand for their services,"" he added.

When commenting on the results archived during the two years of the normalization process, Duany emphasized that the pace of normalization was swift in some areas, such as the removal of Cuba from the US State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism, the reestablishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, or the opening of embassies in Washington and Havana.

""The most significant change since December 17, 2014, when Barack Obama and Raúl Castro announced the beginning of the thaw in U.S.-Cuba relations, has been the spectacular increase in the number of U.S. travelers to Cuba,"" he added.

""In other areas, such as U.S. trade and investment in Cuba, the situation has remained intractabale, especially given the persistence of the U.S. embargo of the Island,"" Duany concluded.

Last week, Cuban President Raul Castro criticized the new US policy, which excludes the possibility of continuing a bilateral dialogue or the implementation of the previously signed agreements between the two countries, but noted that Cuba nevertheless wishes to engage in dialogue with the United States.

Cuban officials warned in June that a reversal of Washington’s policy toward Havana would fail. Moreover, Cuba has hit back by accusing the United States of a huge number of murders and misconduct by its police as well as of illegal detention and torture of prisoners in the US detention center at Guantanamo Bay.

On July 20, 2015 the United States and Cuba reestablished full diplomatic relations by reopening embassies in their respective capitals after 54 years of hostility."

© REUTERS/ Marko Djurica UK Police Say There're Grounds for Manslaughter Charges Over Grenfell Tower Fire

The Grenfell Tower fire tore a community apart. In the days after the tragedy, missing picture posters of loved ones filled the streets.

However one month on, as bodies are identified and funerals take place, people are slowly coming to terms with their loss and the fact that this fire, which killed at least 80 people, really did happen.

The latest body to be identified was that of two-year-old Jeremiah Deen.

​Many of the survivors and family members of people who perished are suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) which is defined as an anxiety disorder caused by a very ""stressful, frightening or distressing event.""

Judy Bolton, a clinical nurse and coordinator of the Justice for Grenfell campaign told Sputnik that the help from local and national government has been minimal and more needs to be done to ensure those suffering from PTSD are helped.

""The UK government or gold command has said they will provide mental health services, to those who are traumatized and obviously in a terrible state. But they are expected to go to them and access these services. So it's not a referral, it's if you feel that you need mental health support, you have to go to them, which beggars belief as many people wouldn't recognize or even know the symptoms of stress, distress, trauma or suicide,"" Ms. Bolton told Sputnik.

​""This is an unprecedented event and I would have hoped that the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea would have actually seen the need to go to the survivors and bereaved families because they also are traumatized as well,"" Ms. Bolton added.

Judy Bolton is all too familiar with the symptoms of PTSD, as a trained clinical nurse, Ms. Bolton has seen the impact of the condition, comparing it to the grieving process.

People will be in denial, many will still be living in disbelief that this has happened, but soon the realization kicks in and the person, unable to cope with their loss and the situation, isolates themselves and stops talking in a bid to deal with the pain.

""With PTSD you are not able to rationally process, it's too much, and so people will go into themselves. Also they will go through erratic sleeping, sometimes not even sleeping. Also anxiety — it can paralyze you… You may see someone withdrawn and zapped out in a chair, not moving or blinking and they are locked in their own trauma,"" Ms. Bolton told Sputnik.

""I spoke to one gentlemen, he has worked all his life… he saved his partner and child from the fire, but now he has to sleep with the light on because he is scared to go to the bathroom at night,"" Ms Bolton said.

Signs of PTSD are palpitations, difficulty breathing, dizziness, sweating of hands and face. Ms. Bolton said people will also have an irrational fear of going outside and may develop agoraphobia.

Several reports of people trying to commit suicide have recently surfaced. Ms. Bolton is unable to discuss the details in order to protect people's privacy, but she says the trauma of surviving the fire has led many to want to commit suicide or self-medicate with drugs.

""The police are very aware of the drug dealers in the area. They are very aware of certain outlets that provide illicit drugs […]. We have had an influx of people outside of the area coming in to capitalize on the misery. Again those who seek to capitalize only have to ask questions, the drug dealers are more organized than gold command. Again, it's down to Notting Hill police to ensure they go to the outlets and shut these things down,"" Ms. Bolton told Sputnik

With cuts being made to every area of mental health, accessing support is not easy.

Ms. Bolton commends the local services that have helped thus far, but says waiting times are so long that support has had to be provided by the community.

""We have volunteers who go out at night and help those who can't sleep. Even at 3am you see people walking the streets as they can't sleep. So you have volunteers who will help people and talk to them.

""What we need is a safe place that is accessible 24 hours a day for people to be able to come and help, and receive help [….] People are in a real state and it's a collective state of PTSD,"" Ms. Bolton concluded.

If you know of someone suffering from PTSD since the Grenfell Tower incident, please contact the Justice for Grenfell website or the Samaritans."

© AP Photo/ Michael Sohn EU Ready to Take 'Retaliatory Countermeasures' Against US Over Russian Sanctions

Earlier this week, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said that US President Donald Trump has yet to decide on whether or not to slap a new round of sanctions against Russia.

""There is still time. Obviously, President Trump has not yet decided whether he will tighten the anti-Russian sanctions,"" media reports quoted Gabriel as saying.

""In any case, the law stipulates [the US] holding preliminary consultations with us Europeans, before this can happen,"" Gabriel said, referring to the possible imposition of the new anti-Russian sanctions.

He pledged to use this opportunity for the discussion while in close contact with [US Secretary of State] Rex Tillerson.""

Gabriel also stressed that the goal of the sanctions is to end the Ukrainian crisis and exert political pressure, something that he said could be implemented if ""we act together and cohesively.""

At the same time, he promised to rebuff the industrial policy of the United States that it pursues under the cover of sanctions.

Speaking to Sputnik, Russian political analyst Alexey Zudin noted that for the first time in many years, the US's anti-Russian actions caused an uproar in Europe.

""Perhaps for the first time in post-Soviet history, the EU expressed dissatisfaction regarding Washington's restrictive measures against Russia after it became clear that the sanctions would be slapped and that they would seriously affect European companies and the EU economy. EU officials made rather stern statements that the US's actions are unacceptable, even saying that the EU isn't ruling out retaliatory measures,"" Zudin said.

He added that ""the current situation envisaged that there will be this situation's next round which will see negotiations between the US and the European Union on these new anti-Russian sanctions.""

Zudin singled out at least two major aspects pertaining to the matter.

""The main thing is whether such negotiations will finally take place and secondly, many wonder whether Europe will accept possible [the sanctions-related] concessions from Trump and whether there will be any such concessions at all. This is where a new intrigue lies,"" he concluded.

Earlier, German Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries lashed out at the US's anti-Russian sanctions program, saying that it violates international law and punishes European firms; Zypries called on the European Union to consider countermeasures against Washington.

""We consider this as being against international law, plain and simple. The Americans can't punish German companies because they have business interests in another country, but unfortunately that is exactly what they are doing. That means that it is right that the European Commission now considers countermeasures,"" she said.

The latest sanctions bill will fine businesses for helping Moscow expand and enhance its energy export pipelines, theoretically leaving European energy firms open to incurring harsh penalties for having ties to Russian companies.

Of particular concern to Zypries is Nord Stream 2, a pipeline project aimed at pumping Russian natural gas to Europe via the Baltic Sea to landfall in Germany. The project is being spearheaded by Gazprom, and supported by a number of European partners, including Germany's Wintershall and Austria's OMV."

MOSCOW (Sputnik) — In January 2016, people protesting against the execution of the Saudi Shiite cleric Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr attacked the Saudi embassy in Tehran and consulate in Mashhad. After the incident, Riyadh cut diplomatic ties with Tehran.

Saudi Press Agency reported, citing a source in country's Foreign Ministry, that despite the initial agreements, Tehran had denied the access of the Saudi investigators to Iran as part of their joint activities with the Iranian authorities aimed at inspecting the attacked facilities and finalizing all the processes related to the issue.

The source condemned Iran's attitude to such a sensitive bilateral issue reflected in disrespect for the international laws regulating diplomatic relations, the media outlet added.

The outlet added, citing the official source, that Saudi Arabia will communicate these facts to the international organizations and take all the necessary measures to protect its diplomatic rights in line with the intentional law.

According to Arab media reports, some 100 suspects were detained by Iran following the incident of whom 13 were subsequently sentenced to imprisonment. Earlier on Tuesday, the Iranian Appeals Court reportedly upheld the sentences for 10 of those convicted."

© AP Photo/ Carolyn Kaster Another Shake Up: White House Communications Director Scaramucci Out After 10 Days

White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci resigned from his position on Monday after a tumultuous ten days in charge. US President Donald Trump and his new Chief of Staff General John Kelly requested Scaramucci's resignation after he aired profanity-laced tirades about other members of the Trump administration.

Scaramucci repeatedly clashed with now-fired Chief of Staff Reince Preibus. He had a colorful interview with The New Yorker in which he claimed he wasn't like White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon because he didn't ""try to suck his own d*ck."" In the same interview, ""The Mooch"" called Preibus a ""f*cking paranoid schizophrenic.""

According to the New York Times, the removal of Scaramucci, nicknamed ""the Mooch,"" was at the request of Kelly, a four-star general who has undertaken to bring unruly elements of the White House into line.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders explained that the President had felt that Scaramucci's remarks were ""inappropriate.""

""The President certainly felt that Anthony's comments were inappropriate for a person in that position and he didn't want to burden General Kelly,"" Sanders told a briefing on Monday.

Nikita Danyuk, assistant director at the Institute for Strategic Studies and Predictions of the Peoples' Friendship University of Russia, told Radio Sputnik that the President had turned to Scaramucci because he was a fierce Trump loyalist who promised to fight for his boss in a way that his predecessor Sean Spicer couldn't.

""Scaramucci is a unique case: this person has never been a specialist in journalism, communications or PR, this is a man from the world of finance. The fact that he appointed himself a fierce fighter against those who are 'leaking' information from the White House helped him to earn the support of Donald Trump. However, his inability to control his behavior and communicate with journalists gave rise to this scandal, which convinced Donald Trump that this person does not possess the right professional qualities and brought discord to the White House instead of rallying it,"" Danyuk said.

""Scaramucci had to report not to the White House chief of staff, but to Donald Trump. That is, in a sense Donald Trump gave him carte blanche and instead of using this opportunity wisely, this guy literally in the first few days initiated a scandal. That's why John Kelly, whose main aim is now to consolidate the White House, took the correct decision and dismissed Scaramucci. But at the same time, I am sure that Donald Trump approved it [the decision].""

Danyuk said that the White House reshuffle is an attempt by Trump to improve his currently testy relationship with the press.

""I think the main reason for this game of musical chairs among the staff is that Donald Trump sees the problem not in his politics and not in his management style, but in the absence of proper communication, including with journalists.""

The appointment of General John Kelly should impose more discipline in the White House but while Kelly may be able to steady the ship, others could nevertheless decide to jump from Trump's administration, Danyuk said.

""As for further moves, I am sure that John Kelly, who is very experienced, will try to consolidate the White House team and more departures in the near future are not to be expected. Nevertheless, taking into account that there is an investigation going on about the Trump campaign, that he is at risk of impeachment, there might be some departures. People who think strategically realize that it's better to leave a ship before it sinks,"" Danyuk said."

Edward Snowden, Julian Assange, Bradley/Chelsea Manning – are all too familiar names to a specific kind of folk, namely people who read. Unfortunately a large majority of good citizens around the world ‘have nothing to hide’ and therefore are not alarmed by the disclosures, the persecutions of those who release information and most importantly by encroaching global lockdown on our freedoms Running Man style. George Carlin, John Oliver, and Aidan Kilian deliver the funny, while Andrew Pepper-Parsons (head of policy at a London-based whistleblowing charity — Public Concern at Work) shares his professional opinion.

While some traditional jobs, including full-time positions in the engineering and construction fields, are likely to remain popular in the future, a ""gig economy"" will continue to emerge in the coming years, introducing new methods of communication between employers and employees.

Uber and Lyft changed the way consumers travel in the cities. Airbinb did the same for property rentals. Online talent marketplaces, like Upwork and OnForce, supply new opportunities for those who offer and seek jobs. These services are all part of an on-demand economy, where providers and freelancers are connected with customers with the help of the Internet and special applications.

Two years ago software development company Intuit issued a report saying that by 2020 the number of US employees working as providers in the on-demand economy will double from 3.2 to 7.6 billion.

However, as the number of ongoing controversies in on-demand economy companies is quite high, it seems that relations between ""app workers"" and their employers need improvements.

""Non-standard forms of employment are fourfold: part-time work, temporary work, temporary agency work, that is if a third party involved, and then there is disguised employment, or disguised self-employment. What the report shows, based on 20 years of evidence, is that non-standard forms of employment are on the rise across the globe,"" International Labour Organization deputy director Deborah Greenfield said.

Last year the ILO published a report called “Non-standard employment around the world: Understanding challenges”. According to the organization, new forms of employment have been around for a while, but such jobs are becoming more common and people who picked them have a right to stable earnings and adequate social protection.

The International Labour Organization has also come up with a list of recommendations, including plugging regulatory gaps, strengthening collective bargaining within non-standard employment communities and improving social protection mechanisms.

While car manufacturing jobs were big in the 1950s, by the turn of the century humans have been replaced by robots, leaving thousands of people jobless. So, according to many experts, flexibility, self-improvement and constant learning are becoming key abilities for those who would like to make a successful career in the 21st century.

In one of the scenes in the 1967 Hollywood classic movie “The Graduate”, Dustin Hoffman’s character Ben is getting career advice from an older man — Mr. McGuire. The man says just one word – “plastics,” adding that there is a great future in plastics.

Indeed, plastics were huge in the subsequent decades, especially during the 1970’s and 1980’s industrial era, so Ben would have probably succeeded if he listened to Mr.McGuire’s advice. But what is the new “big thing” now when it comes to investment opportunities and jobs skills, which will be in high demand? We asked Denis Cherkasov, who is CEO at SBVC Asset Management, part of Sberbank Group:

""Certain basic skills will be required in foreseeable future, for me – I think these are mathematics and music. So knowing music and knowing mathematics will keep your children employed in the next century. That would also be my advice to young children, who are now stepping into the world,"" Cherkasov said.

Cherkasov, who’s worked in a number of Russian and foreign investment firms, says that job market trends are quite volatile. What’s in demand now may very well lose value in the future.

""Now everyone is talking about robotics and artificial intelligence; the ‘Internet of things’. Some time ago there were other technologies – crowdfunding, new fintech technologies. Earlier there were new technologies in clearing and banking and finance. So, what it is necessary to learn – is to learn how to learn, how to stay constantly on edge, to educate and upgrade yourself and to have a flexible mind,"" Cherkasov pointed out.

So, it’s likely that many fields of study, including robotics, may look completely different within coming years, and some knowledge will become outdated in as little as few months.

""We live in a world where everybody’s knowledge – my knowledge – becomes obsolete within 6 months. We step into a world where continuous learning and the improvement of skills becomes absolutely crucial not only to move forward, but just to remain on the edge, and keep your position, so to say,"" Cherkasov concluded.

It’s possible that in a changing digital world, you won’t be doing the same thing for decades, and going in a new direction may require additional professional education. In that case, computers, which may have been the reason why you quit, may actually help you to acquire a new profession with the help of AI-enabled custom courses and e-learning programs.

Computers and the Internet already play an important role in most industries – from medicine to agriculture, and from the legal world to manufacturing. However, it’s expected that thanks to artificial intelligence, computers will become even more powerful in the coming years, changing the very way people learn their professional skills.

In 2016 a US-based publisher of business forecasts, Kiplinger, compiled a list of the 10 best jobs of the future, putting five health care industry jobs at the top of the list. Occupations like nurse practitioner, medical sonographer and dental hygienist were followed by a number of computer industry jobs.

The first five professions definitely require a specialized medical education, but also – some degree of computer skills, since most hospitals are equipped with tons of computer equipment. However, it appears that becoming more computer-literate is not just a problem facing younger employees. Seasoned professionals also need to adapt, and not only in the medical field; consulting firms now require tech-savvy as well.

Ian Colebourne, Managing Partner of Deloitte CIS, told Sputnik that besides having traditional finance and legal educations, the new generation of employees is more tech-savvy: ""I think the new generation is coming through already, if you're looking in terms of educational experience, they're so much more literate in terms of the power of technology, and the Internet, and coding, and all of these other areas. And that’s where I think that we see a big shift in terms of our own workforce.""

Deloitte CIS is quite serious about harnessing the technologies of the future, including those which will change the way people learn.

In June, the company announced a joint project with Genome Ventures – a Moscow-based company, which specializes in ed tech and human capital development. The partners place big bets on artificial intelligence and its applications in the private and public sectors.

""We are exploring how together with Genome Ventures we can develop the very-very high capabilities around artificial intelligence. Not only in the sense of its impact on the business, but also in terms of that impact for society, so that it creates opportunities for people not only to develop their skills, but also how we need to understand how we need to adjust the education platforms to equip our young people to be able to succeed and thrive in what will be a digital world,"" Colebourne concluded.

There are several key advantages of AI in learning. The technology allows educators to create adaptable ""tailored"" material, which will help particular individuals understand the material better. Besides, artificial intelligence is good at finding remote assistance for pupils, with crowd-sourced tutoring becoming more and more popular. And above all, AI promises to become a good companion for those who embrace lifelong learning, which is becoming important in the digital world.

Artificial intelligence, big data and computers are quickly changing the global job market. Many jobs may cease to exist within the next decade, as humans are replaced by robots and software. So finding your way in a world of “outdated” and totally new careers is not an easy task.

The job market as we know it may change dramatically within the next few years. According to Staff.com co-founder Rob Rawson Several, some positions once considered the mainstays of banking and finance, including bookkeepers and accountants are likely to be replaced by AI by 2028. Such predictions may give food for thought to those who picked finance as their college major. In a world where AI and neural networks are becoming increasingly successful in competing with humans, it’s hard for young people to pick a future job which will remain relevant by the time they graduate from college.

Even for successful entrepreneurs like the legendary investor Jim Rogers, it’s hard to make exact predictions when it comes to the job market. Rogers, who is Chairman of Beeland Interests Inc., started his career on Wall Street in the 1960’s. However, unlike many of his colleagues, who preferred to stay in the office, Rogers decided to travel around the world. In the 1990’s he visited more than 100 countries, riding a motorcycle and later — driving a custom-built Mercedes. When asked about career choices, Rogers told Radio Sputnik listeners to trust their gut feeling.

“People have to figure out their own passions. And then – do it! Don’t listen to me, don’t listen to your parents, don’t listen to your professors, and don’t listen to your friends. Figure out what you really love and do it. And if people laugh at you – you’re really doing the right thing. You’re really on the right track”

The author of “Adventure Capitalist” and “Investment Biker” decided to leave New York City in 2007 and moved his assets to Singapore, saying that it was the right time to invest in Asian markets. He’s still firm in that belief. The famous investor also says that the revolutionary “next big thing” may very well be in the making right now, and in the coming years technology and the Internet will play a key role.

I’m sure there are now 18-year-old kids in the garage somewhere, coming up with something totally new that’s going to change the whole world – it frequently happens that way. Maybe my children will find the profession of the future. But it certainly has to do with the Internet; it certainly has to do with technology.

According to Payscale.com, computer science graduates are currently in high demand, with annual salaries of $123,000 and up. So, if you’re looking for a career path which is likely to remain relevant in the coming years, hi-tech and internet-related businesses may very well be the right choice for you.

People have been using different authentication methods to gain access to different systems, including online ones, for decades. However, thanks to a new technology there will be no need to use keycards or your body parts, let alone memorize passwords to gain access to your devices, or to online accounts.

Ever wondered what it would be like to protect your electronic devices or online accounts with something other than passwords? There are dozens of other proven authentication technologies out there, such as near-field communication (or NFC) tokens, USB keys, as well as biometric methods.

In the 1983 James Bond movie “Never Say Never Again,” a US Airforce pilot, Jack Petachi, who is also the operative of the criminal organization called Spectre, undergoes an eye operation to make it match the retinal pattern of the US president. Spectre wants Petachi to cheat the retinal scan system and gain access to nuclear warheads to extort billions of dollars from NATO governments.

Even though stealing and recreating someone’s retinal pattern seems impossible to do even using today’s advanced technology, the portrayal of the retinal authentication technique in the movie is quite accurate. US government agencies have been using the method since the 1970s. Even though the technology has its own flaws, including the high price of hardware, it’s 200,000 times more accurate than fingerprint identification.

However, neither retinal scans nor the more advanced iris scan technology, which is good for the Pentagon or NASA, can be used by the average consumer who wants protection and security online at a reasonable price. The cost of hardware and a subscription for such technologies is too high and the whole concept is inconvenient for daily home use.

Instead, scientists have come up with a new idea (which is, by the way, is not entirely new). In 1844, the first telegraph message saying ""What hath God wrought"" was sent from the US Capitol to Baltimore, Maryland. The first telegraph operators developed their own style of typing – a unique “rhythm signature,” which was easy to identify.

© AFP 2017/ KAREN BLEIER Cybersecurity Firm Notes Increase in Bitcoin Scams on Social Media

Nowadays, thanks to AI and other advanced technologies, people’s typing patterns and habits can be used to identify them. Besides the number of words per minute, there are other unique characteristics at play, such as “hold-time” for each key, right-handed, or left-handed approach and “rapid-fire sequences,” in when the user types common letter combinations, such as “the”, or “ing”. So, in keystroke dynamics, it doesn’t matter which password you typed – it’s how you typed it.

Researchers say that the beauty of the method is not only in its use for initial authentication. It can be used continuously. So even if someone was able to impersonate the user during an email login sequence, the system can identify and block the bad guy later, if he tries to compose a new message, and his keystroke dynamics will not match those of the account owner.

So, with the growing use of AI and machine learning, we may very well see the rise of keystroke dynamics and other advanced authentication methods, which minimize the possibility of identity theft and help users stay safe online.

Last year, antivirus provider Kaspersky Lab announced that some 323,000 new samples of malware are discovered each day. The Internet is becoming a jungle, and even with proper protection measures being taken, it’s very hard for the average user to stay safe online.

In the early days of computing, there were only a few viruses, and not all of them were malware since some were created by programmers for fun or educational purposes. However, by 2011 computer security firm Kaspersky Lab was discovering 70,000 new malicious files daily. In the next six years, that number increased by almost five-fold. Kaspersky says cyber criminals turned to mass production of viruses, so the antivirus giant had to employ a new kind of technology based on machine learning to improve detection process. Hacking software is being made on such a massive scale that it's becoming increasingly harder for antivirus manufacturers to keep up.

New exploits, which use newly-found ""0-day vulnerabilities"" (and thus stay undetectable for antiviruses and firewalls for a while), create so much chaos that critics claim antivirus software is becoming obsolete. But Steven Coty – Chief Security Evangelist of cloud security firm Alert Logic thinks otherwise. Here's a part of his interview on the YouTube channel SingleHop:

Antivirus is key. Regardless of what some people say – it's not dead. And antivirus software still has a place in the security in-depth strategy. We deployed a honeypot late last year and it's been running for well over a year now. We've been collecting a lot of malware samples from different actors around the world. And we've run this through an open-source tool called VirusTotal, where you can basically upload a piece of malware and it will run that malware across fifty of the top antivirus vendors in the world. And we found that 14% of the malware that we've run through there came undetectable, which means 0 of the 55 antivirus vendors picked it up. But they did catch 86%, so antivirus software still has a place in your security in-depth strategy.

However, using antivirus software is not a sure-fire cure for malware epidemic. Researchers say that there are a number of other things that users have to do to stay safe online.

First of all, you have to follow the news and know the scams. The recent WannaCry ransomware epidemic could have been stopped much quicker if thousands of Windows users protected themselves by reading security advisory and patching their systems on time.

Secondly, it's very important to use unique strong passwords for different websites. Passwords like ""12345,"" and ""abc123"" just don’t work anymore. Change your passwords regularly and use two-factor authentication when possible.

Thirdly, think carefully before clicking on links, especially those in emails from unfamiliar senders. Phishing scams are becoming increasingly popular and bad guys do a lot of research to tailor individual messages to their victims.

Besides that, there are dozens of other tips that will keep you safe, like installing security updates on time, using a firewall and improving your online shopping habits.

And, of course, all of that applies not only to your laptop and desktop computers but also to handheld devices, such as tablets or smartphones.

In the early days of the computer era, most hacking was done by curious students who used ""playful cleverness"" to manipulate electronics. Later, the term ""hacker"" took on a negative connotation. But besides criminals and rogue actors, the modern hacking scene is also populated with hackers who work for the government.

In April of 2017, hacktivist group Shadow Brokers posted several archive files on the popular blogging platform Medium. According to posters, the files contained utilities that belonged to Equation – a hackers group which allegedly works for the National Security Agency.

At first Shadow Brokers put the archives up for auction, but in the end the toolbox did not go to the highest bidder. For some reason the group posted passwords to the archives, releasing the genie out of the bottle.

""Beasts"" with names like ODDJOB, FUZZBUNCH, ETERNALBLUE and DOUBLEPULSAR were downloaded by thousands of Internet users from all over the world. With these tools even inexperienced programmers were able to gain access to various PCs, including those that use Linux and Solaris operating systems.

Here is Watchguard CTO Corey Nachreiner talking about the leaked scripts on YouTube.

The researchers mentioned there were 12 significant vulnerabilities in various versions of Windows, including what they said were up-to-date versions of Windows that could allow bad guys to remotely exploit Windows computers over the network. SMB vulnerabilities are a very big deal. Threats like Configure have used major SMB vulnerabilities in order to spread automatically.

The appearance of the alleged ""Big Brothers toolbox"" out in the open led to heated debates about the US government's online spying ops, and about the NSA's ability to defend itself and eventually find the source of Shadow Brokers leaks. Some NSA critics, like the organization's former contractor Edward Snowden, said that the source should be easily identifiable.

NSA just lost control of its Top Secret arsenal of digital weapons; hackers leaked it.

​The massive leak of ""government malware"" led to serious consequences. In less than a month unknown bad guys compiled ransomware utilities, which spread across the Internet at the speed of light, infecting and locking Windows computers all over the world and demanding a ransom in bitcoins. According to researchers, malware called ""WCry"" or ""WannaCry"" use two utilities leaked by Shadow Brokers – ETERNALBLUE and DOUBLEPULSAR. The spread of WCry was stopped rather quickly by Microsoft and other software manufacturers taking action and warning users to install updates and patches. But other variations of WannaCry sprung up like jack-in-the-box, making it harder for anti-virus makers to thwart the epidemic.

The term “hacker” was coined by members of a small tight-knit student community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But the word’s meaning has changed drastically since it first appeared in the 1960s.

They are sometimes more famous than movie stars and more notorious than ordinary criminals. The media runs stories about hackers every day, with reports about security breaches, virus attacks and email leaks making the headlines. The word “hackers” is often used to describe highly skilled computer experts, capable of overcoming problems with the use of technical knowledge. However, that is not exactly what the “original hackers” meant.

Here is MIT alumni Richard Stallman talking about the origins of hacking.

“What we mean and meant by hacker is enjoying playful cleverness. And this doesn’t just mean with computers. If you like playful cleverness, you’ll find ways to be playfully clever in whatever medium happens to come to hand.”

Here is a brief showcase of “playful cleverness” tricks, also known as “MIT hacks”- practical jokes and pranks, which became part of campus history. In 1963 MIT pranksters hacked telephone switchboards to make free calls. On several occasions they placed heavy objects, such as a glass cow, a frame of a fire truck and a campus police cruiser on top of the MIT Dome. In 1991 they connected a fire hydrant to a drinking fountain to illustrate their saying that ""Getting an Education from MIT is like taking a drink from a Fire Hose"".

In the 1980s many programmers tried to separate hacker culture from criminal activities, such as break-ins by using alternative terms and definitions, such as “cracking “, ”black hat”, “white hat” and “grey hat”, which were meant to describe the legality of particular actions.

However, most of the time, when journalists use the term “hacking” they only mean cyber crime. Even though most break-ins are criminal in nature, the motives behind break-ins, email leaks and virus attacks may vary. Hacktivist networks, such as “Anonymous” often act against government and corporate structures. They oppose internet censorship and control. Other hackers are “guns for hire”, who use Deep Web message board to advertise their services – from breaking into someone’s Facebook profile, to stealing financial records and classified government data. “White hat” hackers are security experts who scan systems for security flaws and notify software developers so that these vulnerabilities can be patched. And, of course, there are hacking artists, who use technology as artistic medium. They work with graphics, sculpture, audio and video, as well as computer hardware.

In today’s world, where technology is making giant leaps, new meanings and overtones for the word “hacking” appear almost every year. So, perhaps, in the next decade, the meaning of the term itself will be transformed even more, drifting even further away from past century’s “playful cleverness” era.

In the early days of the Internet there were only a few forms of malicious software – mostly viruses and trojans. The mass distribution of malware was also typical for that era. Nowadays hackers use a variety of new tools, including programs, which are fine-tuned to hunt down a specific victim.

Usually, it is very hard for an alligator to chase its prey on dry land. But once the victim approaches a small swamp to quench its thirst, the predator’s chances of having a proper dinner increase. This hunting technique is called “watering hole attack,” and, as it appears, alligators are not the only ones using it. Computer hackers, those who target a particular individual or company, developed a similar approach. They analyze a list of websites that their victims are visiting and inject malicious code into these pages making it easier for users to “swallow the bait”. Sometimes the code can be disguised as a simple visitor counter, which was modified to automatically install malware on the user’s computer.

Here is Cisco’s threat research and analysis team leader Craig Williams talking about tackling the watering hole attack.

Unfortunately, simple patching isn’t always a solution because we have seen things that are 0-day. That means that no one saw them before and no patch exists. If there is a patch – obviously apply the patch, but if there is no patch, defense in depth is your friend. And even if you’re patched you should look for indicators that you’re compromised, because users may visit those websites outside your secure network. They may take their laptop home, and they may not log in with a VPN.

However, the “watering hole” technique is not the only one used by hackers to steal data from your computer. Usually, the threats are mixed – with “good old fashioned” trojans, viruses and exploits, which are also being used to infiltrate target PCs. For instance, hackers can apply the “spear phishing” method to send personalized emails to particular users, which contains links to “watering hole” fake websites, which mimic popular web pages.

Trojans, malicious programs disguised as JPEG and other files, which were often used in the 2000s by hackers to gain access to desktop and laptop PCs, recently made a powerful comeback on handheld devices – smartphones and tablets. In 2016 alone more than 8 million smartphones were infected with malicious installation packages.

Such sophisticated methods are making it hard for users to stay safe on the Internet. However, computer security experts recommend updating anti-virus software as often as possible in addition to using common sense. Basically, pay more attention to details, and if you get a suspicious email, don’t click on the links, even if the letter looks like an important message from your bank, your friends or your colleagues.

Engineers started experimenting with the first wearable computers back in the 1970s. While the first prototypes, which already had some AR capabilities, were large and bulky, over time the introduction of new memory chips and processors allowed designers to make these devices smaller, lighter and more powerful.

Steve Mann is a radio engineer and wearable computing pioneer, who built his first augmented reality device long before the digital era. The gadget was capable of visualizing electric and other waveforms by creating graphic representations. Here’s Steve describing his invention in a keynote video for the AR-in-Action conference.

“It has terminals that I can use to pick up different signals. It allowed me to pick up television signals and radio waves and sound waves and so on, and to display them as an augmented reality overlays. So I waved this light stick back and forth and these lights are connected to here, there are 35 lights in five groups of seven, connected by 12 wires. It allowed me to create augmented realities and present this to audiences of hundreds of people who could see this all at the same time without any special glasses or any other special apparatus.”

Steve’s ideas evolved over time. His wearable computers became lighter and more portable. In the 1980’s he had to carry a backpack full of equipment and wear a big helmet, which probably looked more like Doc Brown’s crazy gadgets from Back to the Future than something useful. But now Mann’s equipment is sleek, efficient and lightweight – very similar to what other developers have shown in devices like Google Glass, but with extended brainwave sensing capabilities.

Currently, there are many augmented reality and augmented virtual reality products on the market. In 2016, Microsoft started selling its Hololens mixed reality glasses. Later that year, the software giant announced the global expansion of the project, which was previously only targeting the US and other markets, such as Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, France and the UK.

HoloLens and Kinect creator Alex Kipman says that thanks to these new gadgets, people are already able to enhance their perception of life. Here is Kipman talking about HoloLens applications in his 2016 TED talk.

“I’m not thinking about a distance future, I’m talking about today. We are already seeing car companies like Volvo designing cars differently with Hololens, universities like Case Western redefining the way medical students learn, and my personal favorite – NASA is using HoloLens to let scientists explore planets holographically.”

Google went in a different direction when it came to AR, with Tango technology, which uses smartphones and tablets rather than special glasses, to add an extra visual layer to everyday reality. Facebook is also placing big bets on AR. Mark Zuckerberg’s company spent a lot of time recently on developing special camera apps, so it’s likely that in the coming years we’ll see more augmented reality features in the world’s largest social media network.

In 2015 Google introduced Google Glass, adding an extra visual layer to people's reality. The project was terminated shortly after, following heated debates over privacy issues. However, it didn't stop other companies from developing their own augmented reality gadgets.

© Sputnik/ Alexandr Kryazhev How AR Technology Helped Game Developers in Creating a New Dimension

In 2013 a group of ""Glass explorers"" in the US got the chance to test a totally new gadget. For $1,500 each of them received a set of spectacles equipped with a camera, display and a built-in computer. The device called Google Glass was capable of understanding voice commands and recording a video of everything that the wearers saw. However, the gadget's main feature was augmented reality (or AR) – the capability of projecting a supplementary layer of information onto an advanced LED panel.

Google Glass users were able to access email, look at maps and enjoy social media applications, as well as third-party apps. But the project was suspended not long after the first devices were marketed to the public. A heated debate raged over possible unauthorized videotaping and facial recognition. Some businesses announced anti-Google Glass policies way before the device was actually made available to the public. In Russia law enforcement agents could have easily seized the gadget because of its spying capabilities, and wearing Google Glass may have even been a criminal offense.

However, Google's negative experience didn't stop other companies from working on similar projects. In 2016 Snapchat started selling their own camera-equipped glasses called Spectacles for $130 a piece. Snapchat marketed the product as a fun toy, rather than serious gadget. The company's CEO Evan Spiegel told The Journal that Snapchat will ""roll out"" Spectacles very slowly so that Snapchat could figure out how they fit into people's lives and see how they like it.

Even though technically Spectacles are not as advanced as Google Glass when it comes to AR capabilities, videos from the gadget are still being uploaded into Snapchat galleries, which is only likely to inflame the debate over privacy.

However, as social networks are set to play an even more important role in people's daily lives, AR gadgets may very well make a powerful comeback.

Veteran computer graphics developer Jon Peddie says that by 2020 humans will be wearing AR glasses which will be capable of displaying useful information, such as directions and translations, as well as recording video. He adds, that in just a few years disputes over AR's privacy will not matter as much as they do today.

""In a world of nation-backed hackers and with laws that now allow ISPs to sell your browsing history and other information about you, in a world with WikiLeaks, and spy magazine, and other privacy intrusions and security break-ins, the romantic and idealistic notion of security and privacy is something we tell ourselves we have to protect, and does not exist.""

Other tech giants, such as Facebook are working on their own AR gadgets. The company recently launched a new Camera Effects Platform for developers, which allows adding an AR-layer to Facebook's multimedia content.

While augmented reality is becoming a very popular tool for video game developers, its capabilities go well beyond digital entertainment. Doctors use AR to study the human body and police are testing AR-enabled body cameras for crime scene investigation.

If Sherlock Holmes saw how Dutch police are using smartphones and body cameras, he would have probably reconsidered some of his famous deduction techniques. A joint project between the Dutch police, the Netherlands Forensic Institute and the Dutch Fire Brigade relies on technology developed by a company called Twinkl to help investigators sort out objects at the crime scene. A video feed from officers' body cameras is being supplemented with an additional visual layer to help find important clues. For instance, an agent who just busted a suspected drug lab will instantly get a notification on his smartphone to bag a bottle of chemicals which can be used as evidence.

Augmented reality, or AR, is a method of adding a supplemental layer of visual information to a live video feed. Usually it requires gadgets like smartphones, tablets, and special headsets. Even though the first descriptions of AR can be found in the early 1900's sci-fi, the first working AR-enabled gadgets appeared in 1980's and the 1990's.

While AR may very well become a great crime-fighting weapon for law enforcement agents chasing bad guys, it's also a powerful tool for doctors who save people's lives.

An Israel-based company, Augmedics, developed a head-mounted display called the Vizor, which gives surgeons the power to literally look inside a human body.

Here is Augmedics' vice president in charge of research and development Stuart Wolf talking about the new gadget:

The Vizor allows surgeons to see the patient's anatomy through soft tissue and skin, just as if they had x-ray vision. Using our patent-pending technology, we are able to project a patient's anatomy directly onto the surgeon's retina with surgical precision in real time and achieve outstanding depth perception.

© Sputnik/ Alexandr Kryazhev How AR Technology Helped Game Developers in Creating a New Dimension

In addition to surgeons, nurses and physicians also make use of AR in situations where it's hard to see something with the naked eye. A device called VeinViewer uses near-infrared vision to find and map human veins and to project them onto a patient's skin.

AR, along with virtual reality technology, is currently on the rise. According to a recent report by Analisys Group, the total combined economic potential of AR and VR may reach up to $102 billion by the year 2020. The same report also suggests that medicine, including surgery and diagnostics, may become the largest projected area, with 35% of the global AR/VR market.

In 2016 the augmented reality game Pokemon Go became a global phenomenon and an extremely profitable mobile app. However, the game's developer Niantic wasn't first in creating an alternate digital layer of reality, which captured the imagination of gaming fans worldwide.

When you launch your favorite smartphone navigation software, monsters would probably be the last thing you'd expect to see on screen next right next to your favorite supermarket. But that is exactly what happens in the Parallel Kingdom – a mobile app, which layers an interactive alternate reality on top of your town's map. Created in 2008 by Wisconsin-based company PerBlue, this location-based role-playing game was the first application of its kind for Android and iOS. The Parallel Kingdom was distributed freely and allowed users to claim territory on the map and protect it by challenging other players in duels.

The game eventually went through five iterations and received numerous industry awards – from being Best Augmented Reality Game of 2009, to becoming a finalist in the Mashable 2011 awards among Best Mobile Games.

In 2012, four years after its launch, Parallel Kingdom had 1.8 million subscribers.

Here is how PerBlue's community development manager Ellie Humphrey explained the game's popularity in her interview on Beau Hindman's YouTube channel:

I think the first reason it's because it's been around the longest. So, we have kind of organically grown within four years, so that's the big reason. I think the second reason, is because it's such a deep game, there's so many things that you can do and different ways you can play it… And, I think the third reason is that we're updating, we're always adding new missions, new quests, new legendary monsters, there's always on the horizon, some element of surprise.

Augmented reality, or AR, is a technology, which allows adding augmented or supplemented elements to live view of the real-world environment. Video game development is just one of AR's applications. It's being widely used in medicine, aviation, literature, design and commerce.

AR applications rely heavily on the host device's hardware. They often require several crucial components – mobile connectivity, a high-resolution camera and precise geolocation services.

9 years ago, when the Parallel Kingdom was released, there weren't too many mobile devices on the market capable of supporting immersive AR content.

But in 2016, when many smartphones were getting quad-core and octa-core central processing units, AR-enabled games gained momentum.

San-Francisco-based Niantic released Pokemon Go, which allowed players to catch and train imaginary monsters which were roaming around in an environment, which was skillfully merged with live smartphone camera video.

According to Global Industry Analysts, in the coming years, the mobile augmented reality market is only going to get bigger, and AR-enabled games will become one of the major growth categories.

Augmented reality is now being used in dozens of applications – in space exploration, medicine, video games and archaeology. But even though it relies heavily on today's technology, AR, which adds extra visual layers to reality, was first mentioned way before the invention of TVs, computers and smartphones.

In the 1901 sci-fi novel ""The Master Key,"" a teenage boy summons ""The Demon of Electricity"" and starts receiving mysterious gifts, with one of them looking a lot like today's augmented reality gadgets. Here is how the author of the novel L. Frank Baum describes the device:

""It consists of this pair of spectacles. While you wear them every one you meet will be marked upon the forehead with a letter indicating his or her character. The good will bear the letter 'G,' the evil the letter 'E.' The wise will be marked with a 'W' and the foolish with an 'F.' The kind will show a 'K' upon their foreheads and the cruel a letter 'C.' Thus you may determine by a single look the true nature of all those you encounter.""

What L. Frank Baum's readers might have considered to be almost impossible, became reality later in the 20th century. The experiments to add extra layers to reality started in the 1950s and 60s and went on throughout 1980s. They gained momentum with the growing popularity of personal computers and the appearance of smaller high resolution displays. EyeTap – a wearable device with a camera, which added computer-generated visuals in real time to what the operator saw, first appeared in 1978. But it wasn't until 2013 that such technology became commercially available, as Google started selling its augmented reality device called Google Glass for $1,500. However, the tech giant abandoned the project following controversy over privacy and safety concerns.

Augmented reality, or AR, is a live direct or indirect view of reality, which is supplemented or altered by computer-generated visuals, audio or GPS data. Currently, besides special glasses or helmets, the technology is widely available on smartphones and tablets.

Surprisingly enough, unlike many other gifts, which were given to the protagonist of ""The Master Key"" by the Demon of Electricity, the modern version of ""magic glasses"" powered by artificial intelligence is now quite close to reading people's minds. An app called Magic uses smartphone cameras to scan faces and is able to accurately interpret human emotions, such as fear, anger and happiness. Then the app augments the live video feed with animated tears, hearts or flames.

Besides video games and entertainment, AR is being widely used in other fields. In archeology it helps to visually rebuild ancient ruins, in medicine it's a great way to teach surgeons and medical students. Tourists can use augmented reality apps to enhance their sightseeing experience, musicians find it quite handy in teaching people to play instruments.

It's expected, that the virtual and augmented reality markets grow even more in the coming years. According to Digital-Capital.com, by 2021 mobile AR could become the primary driver of a combined VR/AR $108-billion market.

Imagine the future 900 years from now, where our planet is part of the United Empire Of Earth, and it’s really hard to become citizen of that empire. This is the plot of the videogame “Star Citizen”, which is currently being developed as a crowdfunded project.

The makers of “Star Citizen” coined the term “first-person universe” to describe their game. Players are free to do anything they like, whether it’s space flight itself, first-person shooting sequences or economic and social tasks that help characters achieve their goals.

The project was launched by Chris Roberts’ company, Cloud Imperium Games, with the help of thousands of gamers. In 2012 Roberts, who is also known for the 1990s space games series Wing Commander, launched a crowdfunding campaign – first in a blog, and then on Kickstarter. Within the following five years the campaign generated more than $150 million dollars, at one point even putting the title into Guinness Book Of Records as “most-funded crowdfunding project anywhere”.

John Erskine – the head of Cloud Imperium Games Texas Studio and the publishing head at Roberts Space Industries, told Sputnik that at first many supporters of the game were from older generations of gamers – people who used to play the Wing Commander series back in the 1990s, but over time the trend changed with even younger players joining the campaign.

When it comes to technology, Star Citizen uses many features that can be found in today’s space exploration games, like procedural generation of objects, but according to John Erskine, the approach to procedural generation and other aspects at Cloud Imperium Games is different: instead of just creating generic planets, the developers focus on immersion and authenticity.

What it really is – is a tool for our designers to be able to rapidly create authentic planets and worlds that are based on procedural generation, but by doing that it allows us to create more content faster, which adds to immersion as well: there are new places to explore and those places are handcrafted with the aid of procedural planet technology – we thought that would be really cool.

Star Citizen is currently in its testing stage and developers are planning to release a major update in the summer of 2017. But unlike many other titles, the game might become a long-running series instead of one finalized title, with new DLCs (or downloadable content packages) being released constantly. Here is what John Erskine told Sputnik about the developers’ plans:

I believe throughout the course of this year all the major systems that we’ve talked about will be online and playable, Hopefully, as long as people are interested in doing it, and funding it, and playing it – then we’ll continue doing it, so hopefully it’s gonna be years and years to come.

Even though this game will remain in development for several years, many players are already putting parts of Star Citizen to the test. So for those who like “sandbox” games, and prefer to expand their in-game world to distant galaxies and unexplored planets, this project is a must-see.

Chased by heavily armed soldiers, John Marston wants to protect his family and is eventually killed in a stand-off against a firing squad. But the death of the protagonist in the video game Red Dead Redemption did not stop the developers from continuing to work on this spectacular Western series.

The Red Dead series was launched as another take on the spaghetti western genre. The first part of the game was released in 2004 by Rockstar Games. It featured “grainy film” special effects and parts of movie soundtracks composed by Enio Morricone. The game received good reviews, but it was very hard for developers to create an open world with smooth graphics on the consoles the game was built for – Playstation 2 and Xbox.

Things changed in 2010, as Rockstar Games published the sequel to its western, called Red Dead Redemption. By this time, the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 offered smoother Full HD graphics. The open world of the game featured rivers, mountains and woods with various wildlife and hidden treasures. Players could choose from single-player missions or free roam mode, or take part in network games.

The game had a catchy soundtrack, with old musical instruments and memorable themes. Rockstar invited composers and musicians using authentic 19th century instruments to recreate the atmosphere of the era. Here is what Davey Chegwidden, who played drums and percussion on the soundtrack, said in an interview with Gamezplay.org:

“You know, a lot of sessions are just trying to serve a song, whereas with this it’s more like just coming up with an emotion, but being a little more vague about it, trying to be somewhat background material, but engage the listener on an emotional level at the same time.”

Red Dead Redemption sold 15 million copies and received Game Of The Year awards from several publications.

For years Rockstar Games remained silent about creating a possible sequel or prequel to the game.

The big news came in October, after developers posted several screenshots on social media with unmistakable features of Red Dead Redemption-2:

​But even after the official announcement was made about the upcoming sequel, fans still clamored for more information. Players launched their own investigations, claiming to have found voiceover artists, actors and developers who might have been working on Red Dead Redemption 2.

We've got another potential lead actor for #RDR2 by the name of Jeff Harms. Resumé found by Jabalous on the Forums https://t.co/G8ufxhKcwW pic.twitter.com/xk1tk8qB00 — Red Dead Network (@RedDeadNet) 3 апреля 2017 г.

​The release is scheduled for the fall of 2017. So if you’re a big Red Dead Redemption fan, with its rumored 4K graphics and the impressive open world seen in official trailer, the next Rockstar Games masterpiece is definitely a must-see title for you.

It’s hard to imagine how long it might take to create a universe. But when it comes to virtual galaxies in computer games, you may actually get a straight answer. It took US indie developer Hello Games a little over 3 years to make an imaginary galaxy with 18 quintillion unique planets in “No Man’s Sky.""

The plot of “No Man’s Sky” resembles many sci-fi stories from 1970s or 1980s. The player finds himself stranded on a remote planet at the edge of the galaxy with minimal resources — a jetpack, and a broken spacecraft. He travels from one planet to another, seeing things that no other humans have ever discovered – rare minerals, abandoned facilities, artifacts and strange beasts.

When Hello Games founder Sean Murray launched his space exploration game in 2016, the title’s motto was “you can do anything.” But as many players discovered, the promising catchy headline wasn’t entirely true. Set against the backdrop of endless stars, the game was built on four main pillars – exploration, survival, combat and trading. Even though the game’s main character – the Traveler, has liberty to choose from millions of destinations and may roam around planets and open space freely, there is only a limited number of tasks that he can perform. Basically, there wasn’t much to the gameplay aside from collecting and selling things, adding items to the catalogue and fighting occasional violent alien beings. Many players considered such repetitiveness boring.

The game was made for Windows PCs as well as for Sony Playstation 4 consoles. It has a unique procedural algorithm for creating planets. Basically, everything you see on screen is being created “on the go”, and there is nothing beyond the horizon until you actually look there.

Here is how Hello Games creator Sean Murray described the game’s engine in his interview with Game Informer on Youtube:

For our game the formula is really complex – [it’s] a series of simple formulas that are actually laid on top of each other to create something quite complex, which is the universe. You’re giving any position in that universe and it will create everything that you see around you – that’s the output.

But the game’s unique features were often overshadowed by the buggy AI and the chaotic behavior of non-player characters, or NPCs.

Even though it was originally promoted as a multiplayer title, “No Man’s Sky” has limited network features, with players having no chance of actually meeting each other somewhere in space. It also suffered from frequent freezes and glitches that were immediately picked up by the game’s critics and used in angry reviews. As a result, a typical No Man’s Sky review on Youtube sounded like this one from KO Gaming:

“I don’t think sadly that these game developers were successful in their overall mission, because overall this game ends up being a buggy, messy, unpolished, unfinished mess. It really does [seem] like most of the time that you’re playing “No man’s sky” that it’s the beginnings of an idea, it’s the first attempt at something epic that needs to be honed in and tweaked and refined for it to be a complete game.”

Despite mixed reviews from critics, the makers of “No Man’s Sky” went on with production, focusing on improvements and updates. In November of 2016 Hello Games released the Foundation Update, which patched many known bugs and introduced some (although not all) of the features that were originally announced by the game’s creators.

So, if Hello Games decides to develop the game further, it may very well become comparable to another space adventure – Destiny, which originally received mixed reviews, but finally gained momentum after several major updates.

If you look at the world map, you will never find Liberty City, San Andreas, Los Santos or Vice City. But for millions of gamers worldwide who love the Grand Theft Auto series, each of these locales is more than a name – it’s a separate open world “sandbox” full of fun and adventure.

Most things you find in the GTA universe are almost stereotypically American. Country music radio, the accents of the characters whom you meet in Sonora desert, “Republican Space Rangers” commercials on fictional in-game radio channels, and even the series’ name itself — Grand Theft Auto, which in US police jargon means “motor vehicle theft,” — everything reminds you that you’re somewhere “stateside.” With all of that in mind you’d probably never guess that the whole GTA franchise was launched by a group of Brits.

David Jones, a Scottish programmer, who invented the game Lemmings, came up with the idea for GTA in the late 1990s. Together with the Houser brothers – Sam and Dan, as well as Leslie Benzies and Aaron Garbut, Jones founded a company called DMA Design, which was later transformed into gaming industry giant Rockstar Games.

The first game in the series was set in a two-dimensional world. Players could freely roam around the city, robbing banks, stealing cars and evading police pursuits. Despite its simplicity, the game sold more than 150 million copies. It was initially intended for the Commodore Amiga, but gained popularity on other platforms, including PC and Playstation, as well as handheld game consoles.

GTA’s sequel was a success too, but the defining moment for the whole series came with the release of Grand Theft Auto 3, which was set in Liberty City – a fictional version of New York. The game had immersive 3D graphics and a soundtrack which could be accessed via radio stations that players could switch on once inside a vehicle. Even though Rockstar had to postpone the 2001 release of Grand Theft Auto 3 due to the 9/11 attacks in order to change references and gameplay deemed inappropriate, the title was a huge success, becoming the best-selling game of the year and selling over 17 million copies.

The series’ popularity was growing, but it also attracted critics. Many argued that the GTA’s violent and explicitly criminal nature set a bad example for younger gamers. The case of Devin Moore, a teenager from Alabama sparked controversy in 2003: the young man was found guilty of the first-degree murder of three police officers. The victims’ families blamed the murders on the influence of Grand Theft Auto games, which Moore was playing, and sued the developers.

Despite controversy, Rockstar Games went on with the series, releasing one successful sequel after another. Following the release of GTA Vice City, which was loosely based on the plot of the movie Scarface and set in 1980’s Miami, the game designers built a sequel centered on early 1990’s Southern California gang culture in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, which was released in 2004.

After that, the company decided to go back to New York and launched GTA IV, which brought the players to Liberty City’s criminal underworld.

​GTA 5, which features separate single player and multiplayer modes, brings together a gang of retired bank robbers who return to their criminal careers in modern-day Los Santos, the LA lookalike that featured in San Andreas.

The multiplayer mode allows several dozen players to freely roam around the city and complete bank heists, stunt mission, races and deathmatches. The game features its own currency, and the possibility to top up in-game accounts with real money.

The game is extremely realistic, giving players freedom to do almost anything. Fans can buy clothes, apartments, cars and motorcycles and show off their achievements using the image galleries of an in-game Instagram-like phone app called Snapmatic.

GTA 5 was named the fastest-selling entertainment product in history after earning 1 billion dollars in the first three days after its release.

So whether you’re a racing games fan, you like first-person shooters, or you’re in pursuit of virtual riches and want to build an imaginary criminal empire, with its diverse content and fast-paced assignments Grand Theft Auto may very well give you hours or even days of entertaining experiences.

Have you ever wondered how life in the universe could look like in the year 3000? Elemental Games – a group of software developers from Vladivostok - tried to answer that question almost a thousand years in advance by releasing “Space Rangers” – a game that gained a mass following in Russia and abroad.

It all started in Russia’s Far East at the turn of the millennium as three gaming enthusiasts – Dmitry Gusarov, Alexey Dubovoy and Alexander Yazinin attempted to create their own space adventure game. Influenced by soviet sci-fi movies, as well as the western space dramas Babylon 5 and Star Wars, the developers wanted to make something outstanding.

Here is what Dmitry Gusarov – one of the developers, said in an interview with Gamedev.ru:

“We created a dynamic virtual world by merging strategy and adventure. Nobody has ever done that before. A famous game developer said once that ‘the game can never be complete, there’s only a moment when you have to stop’ – and that’s what happened to us.”

It took Elemental Games several years to finish the project. Even though the core of the team was based in Vladivostok, the crew started growing rapidly with new members from other Russian regions joining through internet forums to work on various aspects of the game. Elemental Games made its own planetary viewer and quest editor, which were accessible remotely. As a result, 7 authors came up with 26 in-game quests and 3 composers produced a score that Space Rangers is particularly famous for.

The game combines tactics, strategy, in-game arcades and role-playing assignments – and all of that is set against the backdrop of “galaxies far-far away.” The game features 6 races, where humans are just one of several life forms. Players and computer-controlled characters trade with each other, fight, explore new routes and complete other individual tasks on a fast-paced timeline. The game has alternative plots and several endings.

Here is how Gusarov described the mechanics of the game in his interview with Gamedev.ru:

We developed our own engine as well as a number of editors to create planets, screens, ships and fighting arenas. There were a number of unique features in all of that, like the spinning 2D planets with lighting. All in-game objects had alpha channels and the game spares a lot of memory. We converted 2D animated ships into 256 colors so that they would save RAM resources, but since there was no standard graphic format with 256 colors that would support alpha channel, we created our own format. Other similar engines are much worse – just like scrolling in Civilization 3 or Call to Power 2 – they didn’t need a quick screen refresh rate but for “Rangers” it was crucial.

But despite its great overall value and state-of-the-art features, Space Rangers failed when it all came to sales and distribution. Several Russian game bloggers, who reviewed the game, suggest that 1C – a Russian software giant that distributed the title in 2002, didn’t do enough to promote it. As a result, Space Rangers was ignored by Russian gaming magazines and was discovered by most new players through word-of-mouth recommendations. Outside Russia, the release gained a following in Finland and parts of Eastern Europe.

Even though Space Rangers probably missed its chance to become the next big thing in the world of computer entertainment, it was followed by a series of spinoffs. Sequels called Space Rangers 2, and Space Rangers: Reloaded were released in 2004 and 2007, making the title the first and perhaps the most successful Russian open world game ever made.

If that's a bit too pricey for you, you can get a three-ounce (85 gram) bottle of your remains sent into low-Earth orbit for a mere $5,000, where it will spiral for a few years before being pulled back towards Earth and burned up during re-entry.

Space burial services such as these continue to grow in popularity, and start-ups such as Celestis (who have launched the remains of dozens of people into orbit since they began operations in 2015) have come to address that niche. Celestis CEO Charles Chafer says that his company intends to send the remains of as many as 500 Americans into orbital and deep-space graves in 2017.

""We're in the tsunami phase of new space activities,"" Chafer said to the OC Register.

Celestis has partnered with Argos Funeral Service, the first funeral provider to acquire permission to send cremate remains to the Moon. The ashes of the rich and strange who wish to be buried on the moon will hitch a ride aboard a Moon Express private flight. At that point, a robotic lunar lander will carry the ashes and DNA to their permanent resting place.

""It's not all that different from scattering ashes at sea,"" Chafer said. ""Everybody dies. So it's a huge market.""

Luminaries such as Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry chose to be buried in space, which have contributed to its popularization. As space is democratized by private spaceflight endeavors, burials beyond Earth's orbit become increasingly viable.

""Just a few years ago, getting anything into orbit pretty much had an entry price of over $100 million. SpaceX entered the market at $80 million and has now dropped to $65 million [per launch],"" according to spaceflight entrepreneur Greg Autry. ""They are well on their way to getting to prices of $40 million or less. The big satellite pays for 90 percent of the cost of launch, and you can easily throw a few other projects in the trunk.""

""I think space is similar to the way the internet was in driving an economic boom,"" he added. ""The internet wasn't just about routers and cables and TVs, it was about new retail methods and new ways of interacting.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) — In June, the environmental activists from the Reclaim the Power group announced that they would conduct ""creative and disruptive actions"" against hydraulic fracturing every working day of July protesting against the activities of the Cuadrilla energy company preparing to start fracking in Lancashire.

More than 70 activists have been detained during the actions that included ""lock-on"" blockades at the gates of the Preston New Road fracking site, the 2BR broadcaster reported.

The media outlet added citing a representative from Reclaim the Power that hundreds of people participated in the anti-fracking activities aimed at disrupting the activities of Cuadrilla.

According to the news outlet, during the last July event a woman strapped herself to a barrel near the Preston New Road.

In October 2016, London issued a permit to Cuadrilla to carry out fracking at Preston New Road, overturning the decision of Lancashire County Council to ban such activities in the area. In January, the company started construction of the infrastructure at the site, causing protests of local residents and environmentalists.

Hydraulic fracturing or fracking is a technology that allows extracting shale hydrocarbons by injecting pressurized toxic liquid into the ground. Fracking has been largely criticized by its opponents for the risks posed to environment and people's health, as well as for the tremors caused by the technology."

The current has gathered millions of tons of waste into one spot in the ocean to form a garbage pile that, if it were a country, would be the 30th largest in the world.

Trash islands are formed by ocean gyres, which are circulating ocean currents that gradually pull matter to their center. The South Pacific Gyres has slowly sucked in human-made garbage dumped in the water by Pacific-facing countries, forming the massive island of garbage.

The island was discovered by a team led by oceanographer Charles Moore with the Algalita Marine Research and Education in Long Beach, California. ""We discovered tremendous quantities of plastic,"" Moore, who was the first to discover the North Pacific garbage patch in the 1990s, told ResearchGate. ""My initial impression is that our samples compared to what we were seeing in the North Pacific in 2007, so it's about ten years behind.""

© AFP 2017/ ANDREJ ISAKOVIC Pushing Waste Sorting Habit First Step in Sustainable Garbage System, Say Experts

""We found a few larger items, occasionally a buoy and some fishing gear, but most of it was broken into bits,"" Moore added. ""We haven't yet done lab analysis, but based on my visual impression, an enormous area of the South Pacific has millions of plastic particles per square kilometer.""

Moore was the discoverer of the North Pacific garbage patch, which is estimated to be between 270,000 square miles (roughly the size of Texas) to 5,800,000 square miles (twice the size of Argentina) in 1999.

""There's a sense of urgency to get information out about this area because it's being destroyed at an enormously accelerated rate, said Moore. ""For much of the unexplored ocean, we will never have pre-plastic baseline data."" He estimates the trash island to be between 400,000 and 965,000 square miles (roughly the size of Zimbabwe and Egypt, respectively) in size.

Both Pacific patches appear to primarily consist of tiny, sometimes microscopic pieces of plastic. They post a major challenge to marine life, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a British environmental charity.

In January, the Foundation put out a report on behalf of the United Nations that claimed that at the current rate of dumping (""the ""equivalent to dumping the contents of one garbage truck into the ocean every minute,"") trash will outweigh fish in the world's oceans by 2050. Marine life can also mistakenly consume these plastic pieces, which are toxic to most forms of aquatic life.

Furthermore, due to their extremely small size, these plastic grains are virtually impossible to effectively clean up. Marcus Eriksen, a marine pollution researcher who discovered the South Pacific patch in 2011, says that the only way to prevent the islands from growing any further is to stop introducing the plastic into the oceans.

""Gone are the silly notions that you can put nets in the ocean and solve the problem,"" Eriksen told ResearchGate. ""This cloud of microplastics extends both vertically and horizontally. It's more like smog than a patch. We're making tremendous progress to clean up smog over our cities by stopping the source. We have to do the same for our seas."""

The US Air Force (USAF), which for decades used liberal amounts of poisonous firefighting foam in daily operations at local airbases, has refused to reimburse three small Colorado communities after water-purification efforts were implemented to counter toxins at levels some 1250 times above what the US Environmental Protection Agency claims is safe.

Highly toxic firefighting foam used at Peterson Air Force base has for years seeped into the groundwater of the Widefield Aquifer in the Centennial State's El Paso county, resulting in undrinkable water with dangerous levels of poisons.

Within the county, the towns of Security, Widefield and Fountain have spent an estimated $6 million to counter and contain the toxins — as well as to attempt to purify the water so that it can be safely used — with an additional projected $13 million to be spent by the end of 2018, according to a report from the Associated Press.

The USAF has offered lots of bottled water to the towns, as well as a promise that they will ""study"" the aquifer's destruction — but has flatly refused to reimburse any costs for the cleanup, according to Stars and Stripes.

The Air Force, in offering just $1.7 million for use by the water district as well as millions of dollars of consumer-grade filters and bottled water, is unrepentant, according to a spokesman for the force.

""We don't back pay — we cannot reimburse,"" asserted Cornell Long, a Air Force Civil Engineer Center chemist.

Local politicians have reacted strongly, although they too acknowledge that getting anyone within the military infrastructure to acknowledge responsibility is problematic at best.

""We really need financial help,"" stated Roy Heald, the Water and Sanitation District head for the town of Security, Colorado.

Agreeing that the USAF must accept responsibility for the poisoning of the water supply, and that the towns, the county, and the water district ""need to be compensated,"" Republican state Senator Bob Gardner of Colorado Springs added, ""the military needs to go ahead and step up,"" cited by Stripes.com.

The USAF reiterated its intention to ""study"" the issue through 2019, without offering to take any form of definitive action in addressing the county's foul water supply.

When asked for clarification, the USAF offered an email response.

""The Air Force does not have the authority to reimburse communities for costs incurred in dealing with environmental contamination issues.""

Rate hikes for water service are expected in the affected districts."

Russian Scientists Reveal the Secret of 'Red Tides' in the Sea,[],"Toxic red algae, causing ""bloody"" rains and tides in the Baltic, are rapidly spreading across the seas and oceans because they turned out to be absolute omnivores, Russian scientists found.

In recent years, Spain, the Caribbean Bay and some other regions have faced unusual phenomena — ""blood rains"" and red tides, which many religious people considered a sign of an early end of the world. Of course, there is nothing supernatural about it; these anomalies have come as a result of the rapid reproduction and blooming of brown algae. Now, large colonies of these organisms form red spots near the shores of Russia and the Baltic states.

Russian scientists from the Institute of Cytology of the Russian Academy of Science in St. Petersburg revealed the secret of the algae's ""survival success.""

""It turned out that Prorocentrum minimum [algae] can feed on both organic and inorganic compounds. Therefore, there are no such conditions in which these organisms would feel uncomfortable,"" said Sergei Skarlato from the Institute of Cytology, who led the research published in the Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science journal.

In addition, Scarlato and his colleagues found that at abnormally low salinity, these microorganisms dramatically increase their metabolic rate to compensate for the disruption in the work of DNA and proteins.

The combination of these factors, according to Skarlato, explains why the epidemic of ""blood tides"" have swept the Baltic so quickly. The ability to adapt to different conditions helped Prorocentrum minimum colonize unstable coastal ecosystems of the Baltic Sea.

""Red tides"" are extremely dangerous for other types of microbes and pose a threat to the populations of fish and birds, as well as to humans. This is due to brevetoxin, a nerve agent produced by these microorganisms. As scientists have recently discovered, the dangerous substance is produced when the algae lack certain elements. Thus, it starts to produce a sort of ""chemical weapon"" to destroy competitors and to slaughter potential sources of necessary substances.

By accumulating new data in the future, Russian scientists hope to predict and regulate these potentially toxic organisms."

In revealing heavy damage to the reactor as a result of the core meltdown, the robot probe imaged debris mixed with destroyed reactor parts, leading technicians to suspect that what is projected to be a decades-long decommissioning process will be more difficult than initially thought.

A TEPCO spokesman stated that additional time would be required before the company can grasp the full scope of the disaster and assemble a coherent picture of the aftermath.

Extremely high radiation levels require that fresh water be continually pumped into the wrecked reactor to keep it cool, according to Deutsche Welle.

Robot probes have still not uncovered melted fuel in the two other damaged reactors due to the punishing radiation levels.

""It's natural to think that melted material flowed out from the reactor pressure vessel,"" a company spokesperson said Saturday.

In inhospitable territories where a central power grid is nonexistent, the turbines are seen as an ideal, if not essential solution for the supply of electricity.

In some areas along the Russian Arctic coast, wind speeds regularly exceed 5-7 m/s, an extremely favorable indicator for the cost-effective use of wind energy.

© AFP 2017/ ALEXEY DRUZHININ Russian Scientists Develop New Method to Fight Cancer in Early Stages

However, the use of conventional wind turbines has been limited by the regular bursts of high wind speeds, which can damage or break wind turbine equipment. At speeds above 11 m/s, the rotors of traditional turbines risk damage, and their electric generators can overheat. Wind speeds above 25 m/s threaten to destroy the wind turbines altogether.

Russian engineers conducting tests in the Kanin Peninsula, a large Arctic territory in the Nenets Autonomous Region bordering the White and Barents Seas, have found that not a single foreign wind turbine could withstand wind speeds in local conditions. This, scientists said, was an indication that their onboard speed-limiting systems were not effective, and designed for work only in 'hothouse conditions.'

© Sputnik/ Vladimir Baranov Coastline of the Franz Josef Land archipelago.

Accordingly, one of the key challenges for a team of scientists from South Ural State University in Chelyabinsk, Russia has been to come up with an effective mechanism for limiting the power sent from the turbine when wind speeds reach above 11 m/s. The team specializing in wind power has created a unique electromechanical control system which can slow down the rotor, preventing it from reaching dangerous speeds.

The unique nature of the system developed by the Russian scientists consists of its low use of small amounts of power from the generator itself for braking. The completely automatic control system consists of a combination of mechanical and electrical blocks, a programmable microcontroller, and a set of sensors which monitor the current state of the wind turbine's main components.

Yevgeny Sirotkin, a postgraduate student at South Ural State University's Polytechnic Institute, said that the system he and his fellow researchers are working on is one-of-a-kind. ""The system we ae making has no analogues in the world. We plan to create a small enterprise which will engage in the production of these systems.""

""In the Arctic, such a system can pay for itself in the space of a week or a month, following the first wind storm,"" Sirotkin explained. ""The cost of our electromechanical system will be only 2-3% that of the total cost of the wind turbine, and will have a service life of 35 years.""

Waveform gear reduction unit; 6. Reducer input shaft (gear wheel) 7. Guide disk; 8. Flexible manual drive cable; 9. Wire from generator; 10. Electric drive; 11. Drive gear; 12. Mast flange

The scientist emphasized that in areas without a power grid, the cost of electricity generated from wind turbines is just 5-10 rubles per kilowatt-hour ($0.08-0.16 US), far below the cost of energy produced by diesel generators, which can reach up to 80 rubles per kWh ($1.33), and aren't suited for year-round use in harsh Arctic conditions.

The mass production of the super-tough Russian wind turbines requires a large production capacity, including a workshop for casting rotors, a shop for building generators, a workshop for its metal support components, etc. Therefore, the final assembly will take place at a large defense enterprise with which South Ural State University is already cooperating. University scientists will produce the control systems, and supply the finished products for installation aboard the turbines.

The scientists say they are already conducting joint scientific work with their US counterparts, and that Japanese investors are interested in the development of vertical axis wind turbines.

""Horizontal axial wind turbines were developed long ago; their designs have been fine-tuned and worked out. But vertical axis turbines are only starting their development, and this is a very large field of research. Such turbines can be placed on the roofs of buildings, and close to residential areas. Because they do not create vibrations, they do not create infrasonic noise,"" Sirotkin said."

A week ago Sanchez was driving near Fresno when her car swerved and turned over in a field, ejecting and killing her 14-year-old sister, Jacqueline Sanchez. Obdulia continued filming after the crash, showing her sister’s body and saying, ""I killed my f****** sister. I know I am going to jail for life I understand that… this is the last thing I wanted to happen alright… I love you, RIP sweetie…If you don’t survive I am so sorry.""

According to authorities Obdulia had to be strapped to a gurney after kicking a paramedic in the face, yelling racial slurs and spitting on first responders. Police reports say that she refused and alcohol test, smelled strongly of alcohol, and medical records showed that she was legally drunk at the time of the incident.

Samrao argues that Sanchez’s behavior was due to not wanting to leave her sister’s side.

If convicted on six felony counts including drunken driving resulting in injuries and gross vehicular manslaughter, Sanchez could face 13 years in prison. She has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Nicandro Sanchez, father of the two girls, spoke in court with the help of a Spanish translator, saying that he feels like he’s lost both of his daughters, and that he had no ill will towards Obdulia for the crash.

""We’re asking that she be returned home or to the home where she was being taken care of,"" he said.

Harold Nutt, Merced County Chief Deputy District Attorney called Obdulia’s behavior ""disturbing and shocking,” calling her a “danger to society,” and arguing that “she doesn’t have a stable home environment or a stable place to go to."""

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — The Pentagon discovered ""unprecedented"" levels of North Korean submarine activity along with evidence of an ejection test that was carried out at the country’s Sinpo Naval Shipyard, CNN reported on Monday, citing a US defense official.

The report said Sunday’s ejection test is the third one conducted this month and the fourth this year. The test is vital to developing submarine launch capabilities.

North Korea conducted its second ICBM test in less than a month on Friday. According to the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the test was successful with the missile having reached the altitude of 3,725 kilometers (2,314 miles) and traveled 998 kilometers for about 47 minutes before falling in the Sea of Japan."

Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Ministry of National Defense have taken the lead on designing the operation, rather than the National Security Office or Weapons of Mass Destruction department, according to the report that was published on Monday — three days after North Korea’s second suspected intercontinental ballistic missile test.

The NSO and WMD teams have been tasked with establishing separate ""precision strike"" plans for responding to a nuclear or conventional ballistic missile scenario that has ""reached the critical threshold of the Red Line,"" the news agency said.

According to Munwha Ilbo, the plan mobilizes F-15 jets to target key operational command centers in the North, most notably ""the windows of the office of the Chairman of the Labor Party, Kim Jong-un, at the Pyongyang Labor Party headquarters."" Unnamed military officials told the news outlet that ""surgical"" counter-strike plans were being drafted as early as March 31.

Moon has reportedly requested the creation of a new 1,000 to 2,000-person Special Forces brigade ""to eliminate war leaderships"" and ""paralyze command facilities in case of emergency.""

US Special Forces reportedly could have taken out Kim on July 4 but didn’t take the shot.

South Korea’s Ministry of National Defense announced on Monday that ""North Korea is likely to test its nuclear warhead and missile through"" another ""test with more explosive power."" Defense officials believe the next missile test could happen at any time."

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — ""Are you concerned about the embassy being so close to you, given current events? I've heard that some people that some people are concerned about the cameras and that the embassy may be spying on you. Are many people concerned about it?"" the email, received by the residents, said on Monday.

The reporter explained in the email that she was currently working on an article about Glover Park's relationship with the Russian Embassy.

""Is it a frequent topic of conversation? Do you think that having the Embassy in your neighborhood has had much of an impact in the neighborhood? Why or why not?,"" the email added.

One Glover Park resident told Sputnik on Monday that she had never been concerned about the embassy until receiving the email from the Examiner, stressing that now she ""might worry that there could be violence by Americans against that building and apartment buildings in the neighborhood where many Russian embassy workers live.""

""The press must avoid stirring people up,"" she emphasized.

Sputnik has reached out to the Washington Examiner and is awaiting its response.

The story comes amid Moscow’s decision to cut the US diplomatic presence in Russia.

On Friday, the Russian Foreign Ministry urged the United States to bring the number of diplomats and technical staff of diplomatic missions in Russia in line with the number of Russian diplomatic representatives in the United States before September 1.

Consequently, the total number of personnel employed in US diplomatic and consular offices in Russia will be reduced to 455 people. On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the diplomatic presence of the United States in Russia would be cut by 755 employees.

Russia's move came as a response to a series of measures implemented by the United States.

The White House is looking into options to respond to Moscow’s decision, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said during a press briefing on Monday."

Authorities made their way to the replica’s display site after an alarm went off before midnight Friday at the Armstrong Air and Space Museum in Wapakoneta, Ohio, the hometown of Neil Armstrong, who in 1969 became the first human to set foot on the surface of the moon.

Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, another astronaut aboard the Apollo 11, were presented with the module by French jeweler Cartier shortly after their return to Earth after the mission was complete.

Retired NASA agent Joseph Gutheinz Jr. pointed out that the burglars bypassed a moon rock from the mission that could’ve sold to a collector for millions of dollars. ""Either they didn't have easy access to the moon rock, or they weren't into collectibles,"" he told the Associated Press, reasoning that ""they were into turning a quick buck.""

The museum closed for several hours on Saturday and posted a statement on Facebook, saying, ""The truth is that you can't steal from a museum. Museum's don't ‘own’ artifacts. We are simply vessels of the public trust.""

""Museums care for and exhibit items on behalf of you, the public. Theft from a museum is a theft from all of us. Three hundred people driving from across the country were robbed of their opportunity to experience the museum today. For every day that an item is missing, we are all robbed of an opportunity to enjoy it and our history.""

Gutheinz said it would be a ""damn shame"" if the replica was melted down, and it would also make finding the thieves very difficult.

Another Apollo 11 artifact has been in the news lately, as a clerical error led to a NASA bag containing moon dust collected during the mission winding up in the hands of a Chicago area woman, who had to sue to get it back from the space agency after she sent it to be authenticated.

A judge ruled that although the bag should’ve never been placed at auction, NASA had no right to reverse the sale, and the bag was returned to the woman, who sold it at a Sotheby’s auction in New York for $1.8 million

Authorities aren’t able to pinpoint a value for the gold model. The theft is being investigated by local police with assistance from the Ohio Bureau of Investigation."

On Sunday, Bahrain's Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmed Khalifa said that the countries blocking Qatar, namely, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, are ready for dialogue with Doha if the Qatari authorities confirm the end of their support for terrorism.

""We express our readiness for a dialogue with Qatar if it confirms the cancellation of terrorism support,"" Khalifa said at a joint press conference in Bahrain's capital Manama.

As for a possible US contribution to resolving the Qatar crisis, Ishki said that Washington had already worked out a strategy on developing relations with Qatar and that it stipulates the division of duties between responsible persons.

For example, President Donald Trump stands for taking steps to counter terrorism, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson calls for clinching agreements with Doha that will allow the US to take control of all the banking operations carried out by Qatar.

Already, the transfer of each and every riyal from Qatar is coordinated with America, according to Ishki.

After breaking off relations with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates issued an ultimatum with 13 demands to Qatar.

The document includes requests that Qatar sever its relations with Iran, close Turkey's military base in Qatar and shut down the TV channel Al Jazeera, as well as support for the Muslim Brotherhood, a terrorist organization which is banned in Russia, Egypt and elsewhere.

The new ultimatum also did not provide any fixed deadline, according to the reports. It was later reported that the list was not cut down and that a modified list of six broader principles was issued instead.

In 2014, a US airstrike killed Ahmed Abdi Godane, the organization's leader. When Donald Trump became president, he temporarily halted the airstrikes to reevaluate American involvement in Somalia.

The offer comes after China’s fleet began to sail to its first overseas base in the Horn of Africa. Sputnik spoke with a military analyst about this issue.

Kuang Weilin, the Chinese ambassador to the African Union, suggested that China would consider sending troops to the border between the two East African countries, The Associated Press reported on Monday.

He stressed that China is willing to act as a mediator if needed.

Last week, China dispatched a military contingent to its first overseas military base in Djibouti , in the Horn of Africa, so the offer comes amid the increasing presence in the continent.

In an interview with Sputnik, Russian military analyst Vladimir Yevseyev said that the strengthening of the role of China as a major political player in Africa and the Middle East would possibly further disturb the US, as with China rising, the US feels threatened.

However, the question regarding the ability of China to fully cope with the peacekeeper's mission between Djibouti and Eritrea, despite the solid experience of participating in UN peacekeeping missions, remains contentious.

“China is trying to claim itself as a political player who is able to resolve armed conflicts. Yet, it is not clear how much China will cope with this task because China has no great experience in such activities,” Yevseyev said.

In addition, he said that for the settlement of armed conflicts, it is necessary to have special equipment of the armed forces. These are units that have special light weapons and ammunitions.

Furthermore, the peacekeepers should also have the skills to communicate with the local population in English, and also extensive training of the personnel for such peacekeeping operations is required.

“I'm not yet sure that China is able to fully cope with this task. However, the fact that China declares its readiness for a peacekeeping operation indicates that China is gradually becoming a political center of power,” Yevseyev said.

According to the analyst, China’s growing influence is a concern for the US, Japan and South Korea.

Despite that, China’s offer to act as a mediator is seen by some as a positive diplomatic gesture.

An expert of the Diplomatic Academy of China, Ren Yuanzhe, noted that mediation in overcoming international conflicts has become a trend of Chinese diplomacy.

“The trend of development of Chinese diplomacy in recent years is characterized by activity, initiative and offensiveness. It consistently shows an example of the diplomacy of a major power. This applies equally to China's approach to international conflicts in the Middle East and South Asia,” Yuanzhe said.

He further said that the power of China's influence is gradually expanding from Asia to the whole world.

The conflict between Djibouti and Eritrea began in the 1990s. In 2000, Qatar deployed peacekeepers into the zone of the territorial dispute, but the conflict has since grown.

“Against this background, as a responsible major power, China has declared its position, because Africa occupies an important place in Chinese diplomacy. With the realization of the One belt, One Road project we want to bring development and prosperity to the African region,” the analyst said.

Meanwhile, the conflict between Djibouti and Eritrea is capable of splitting regional stability and is not conducive to the development of China's cooperation with African countries.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) — According to the Sada El Balad news portal, the inspection will continue for three days, the five members of the delegation will examine security measures, examination procedures of passengers and their luggage, as well as the security of on-board food and access of airport’s employees to special zones.

The media added that the experts will examine the second terminal, because the flights between Cairo and Moscow, when restored, are expected to arrive at and depart from it.

In November 2015, Moscow suspended flights between Russia and Egypt, after a Russian passenger plane crashed over the Sinai peninsula, killing all 224 people on board. Russia subsequently qualified the incident as a terrorist act. Work to determine the causes of the crash is still underway. Following the crash, Russia suggested that Egypt should increase security measures and sign a joint Egypt-Russia aviation security protocol.

In late May, Russian Deputy Transport Minister Valery Okulov said that the negotiating process on the resumption of flights between Russia and Egypt was suspended. However, Egyptian media reported, citing a source from the country's aviation authority, that Egypt met all demands set by Russia regarding aviation security."

Earlier in the day, Novak told reporters that the situation with oil production in all countries, including Libya and Nigeria, would be discussed at Monday's meeting.

When asked about cooperation with Saudi Arabia, Novak told the newspaper that Moscow and Riyadh are interested in enhancing bilateral partnership in the energy sphere.

""Russian and Saudi companies are exploring opportunities in both oil and gas sectors… We also remain proactive in our dialogue with our Saudi partners on technology co-operation between our countries,"" Novak said, as quoted by the newspaper.

In late 2016, OPEC and a number of non-OPEC countries agreed in Vienna to reduce their oil production by a total of 1.8 million barrels per day from the October level, with Russia's cut of 300,000 barrels per day. The agreement was concluded for the first half of 2017 with the possibility of an extension. In May, the deal was extended by nine months and is now valid until the end of March 2018. Libya and Nigeria are exempted from the obligation to cut production within the deal."

In an interview with Russia's Rossiya 1 TV channel, Putin explained why Moscow had responded to the US sanctions bill.

""The US side again undertook an unprovoked — which is very important — step toward the deterioration of Russian-American relations: on illegal restrictions, on an attempt to influence other countries of the world, including its allies who are interested in developing and maintaining relations with Russia,"" he said.

He added that ""we waited for quite some time that maybe something would change for the better, had such hope, that the situation will somehow change, but, apparently, if it changes, it [won't happen] so soon.""

""I'm not talking about all sorts of reasons of internal political character within the United States itself. But we must, I decided, show that we will not leave anything without an answer,"" Putin pointed out.

Speaking to Sputnik, expert Dmitry Ofitserov-Belsky of the Moscow-based Higher School of Economics described the Kremlin cutting the US diplomatic presence in Russia as a completely justified decision.

""Russia had to show that firstly, it was ready to respond and secondly, that if the US offers a scenario where the conflict escalates, Russia is able to survive this tension and does not agree to surrender,"" Ofitserov-Belsky said.

""In the long run, Moscow's statement on the expulsion of American diplomats and embassy workers, in fact, means that Russia can do without relations with the US on a whole array of issues,"" according to him.

""This measure is not discriminatory and it does not violate any aspects of our [Russian-US] relations. It's just a freezing measure, something that adds to its demonstrative goal,"" he added.

According to the expert, the US in its actions is guided primarily by its own economic interests, which is once again confirmed by the new anti-Russian sanctions bill.

""Regardless of which part of the elite is currently in power in the United States, there is little change in the situation so you should neither be angry with the Americans over the policy they are pursuing nor harbor any illusions,"" Ofitserov-Belsky said.

""The new sanctions are expected to be used against Russian energy companies in order to block the strengthening of Russia's positions in the European energy market. I mean, first of all, the Nord Stream 2 [gas pipeline project],"" he added.

So in this case, the United States proceeded from its own economic interests,"" Dmitry Ofitserov-Belsky said, citing the ""nothing-personal-only-business"" saying.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) — A member of the Presidency of Montenegro’s opposition Democratic People's Party (DNP) told Sputnik he believes that the governments of Estonia, Georgia and Montenegro are likely to use US Vice President Mike Pence’s visit to their countries to capitalize on promoting anti-Russian sentiments in the hope of advancing their own narrow, political interests.

On Sunday, the US vice president started a four-day visit to Estonia, Georgia and Montenegro. During Monday's joint press conference with presidents Kersti Kaljulaid of Estonia, Raimonds Vejonis of Latvia, and Dalia Grybauskaite of Lithuania in Tallinn, Pence accused Russia of alleged aggression toward the Baltic states and expressed the United States’ readiness to protect the countries under its NATO commitments.

""As for Estonia, Georgia and Montenegro, sadly all three countries will use this opportunity to tighten and voice once again their anti-Russian positions, while blindly hoping to benefit from that kind of one sided politics, while not thinking about the eventual cost of it,"" Aleksandar Sekuliс said.

Sekuliс stated that, from the United States' perspective, the vice president’s visit could be used to reinforce US influence within the region. The United States would do this in order to demonstrate to its European allies that despite major cuts in the budget for US foreign military assistance programs, Washington would continue ""to pursue the policies aimed at bringing up the walls against Russia.""

""The latest package of non-provoked sanctions against Russia, which soon to be signed by Mr. [President Donald] Trump, is an additional wind in the wings of this particular visit,"" the politician said, referring to the latest sanctions package approved by the US Senate on Thursday, which now awaits either approval or veto by the US president.

As part of his two-day visit to Estonia, Pence met with the country’s servicemen and NATO troops deployed in Estonia. On Tuesday, the US vice president is also expected to visit US and Georgian troops participating in the Noble Partner drills in Georgia.

Moscow has repeatedly said that Russia has never planned to attack any NATO member.

The Trump administration is preparing sanctions against China in an effort to pressure Beijing into exerting more control over North Korea, the US media reported on Monday.

Trump's aides have spent several days discussing possible economic measures, such as trade restrictions, and are expected to announce a final decision which is expected as soon as this week, White House officials told Politico.

The discussions in Washington come as Pyongyang continues to test intercontinental ballistic missiles. On Friday, North Korea launched a missile which flew 732 kilometers (454 miles), reached an altitude of 681 kilometers (423 miles) and fell in the central part of the Sea of Japan, according to the Russian Defense Ministry.

Trump said on Twitter that he is ""very disappointed in China"" for failing to stop the testing. Beijing has called on Pyongyang to adhere to UN resolutions that forbid the missile launches, but maintains that having already imposed sanctions on Pyongyang in line with the resolutions, there is little more it can do.

I am very disappointed in China. Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2017

…they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk. We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2017

​​Following the Obama administration's deployment of THAAD anti-ballistic defense systems in South Korea, the Trump administration has continued to strengthen its military presence in the Korean peninsula. In April, Trump sent an ""armada"" to the region and has said that all ""options are on the table,"" including military action against Pyongyang.

Having inflamed the situation on the Korean peninsula, the Trump administration is trying to put pressure on China in order to save face and avoid a military intervention, Dr. Francesco Sisci, senior researcher at People's University of China, told Radio Sputnik.

""In a way, the threat of sanctions is still a way of trying to find a political solution. Otherwise, the stalemate could fester and then, of course, there could be military action,"" Sisci said.

Given that the trade turnover of goods and services between the US and China totaled $648.2 billion in 2016, economic sanctions would be very difficult to enforce. The situation is exacerbated by growing mistrust between Washington and Beijing, the analyst warned.

""I believe this growing mistrust is the root of the problem. The US thinks that China can do more about North Korea, China argues that it is already doing enough and in my view the problem is, how can the two sides build more trust and what can we do as third parties to help to build this trust and find a creative solution to this North Korea problem.""

Applying more sanctions to North Korea is also problematic because of the effect they could have on North Koreans.

""China can put sanctions on North Korea but then North Korea can trade with Mongolia or Russia or other countries and circumvent the sanctions. So, how can you have sanctions or other effective measures that can actually put pressure on North Korea without letting North Korea burst, because this is the other problem – you want to contain North Korea.""

""It is still very difficult, but in a positive way I would say that the US despite the rhetoric is still looking for a political solution, it's not ready to go and use military means,"" Sisci said.

""The problem of North Korea is that it is extremely difficult to manage and my sense is that within the US and China there are also different opinions about how to handle North Korea. This difference of opinion makes the handling of the North Korea problem even more difficult and of course, Pyongyang has an easy way of playing one against the other – the US against China, China against Russia, Russia against China and the US.""

""In my view, unless all the concerned countries find a common ground and common policy, North Korea will be in a good position to play one against the other."""

On Monday, WSJ reported that the US defense and diplomatic establishment had devised a plan to supply lethal arms to Ukraine. The weapons, characterized as 'defensive', may include Javelin man-portable anti-tank missiles, anti-aircraft weapons, and other advanced arms. According to the newspaper, US officials want to make the weapons delivery continent on them being deployed away from the frontline in the war-torn Donbass region in eastern Ukraine.

The US Joint Chiefs of Staff and Defense Secretary James Mattis support the plan, and it now awaits the approval of by President Trump, who has yet to be briefed on its details. Officials told WSJ that a final decision from the president could take as long as several months to secure.

The plan is supported by Kurt Volker, the recently-appointed US special representative to Ukraine, who said last week that the conflict in eastern Ukraine was a ""hot war,"" and that Washington should deliver lethal weapons to Kiev to ""stop Russia.""

Fighting between the Ukrainian army and pro-independence militia in the Donbass intensified last month; several dozen combatants were killed and dozens more were wounded in July. Both sides have issued recriminations against the other for the escalation, with Donbass officials also accusing Kiev of indiscriminately targeting civilian areas with artillery shelling.

Ukrainian political scientist Ivan Mezyuho says he cannot dismiss the possibility that the 'anti-Russian hysteria' prevalent in Washington at the moment might induce the US to go ahead and deliver the weapons.

""I cannot exclude the supply of new weapons by the US to Ukraine, given the anti-Russian hysteria that prevails in Washington, including in the ranks of the Republican Party. Of course, I doubt that the Americans could completely satiate the appetites of the Ukrainian military, but some types of US armaments may indeed be delivered to Kiev,"" the commentator said, speaking to Radio Sputnik.

""Moreover, such weapons may be supplied on the condition that instructors from the US, rather than Ukrainian [servicemen], manage them directly,"" Mezyuho added.

The expert warned that the supply of such US weapons would undoubtedly exacerbate the situation in the hot spots both in and around Ukraine.

First of all, ""Ukraine would like to use the US weapons in the so-called 'anti-terrorist zone' [in the Donbass],"" Mezyuho said. Second, ""given that Kiev's actions are completely unpredictable, the weapons from abroad might find their way even to the border with the Transnistrian Moldovan Republic,"" (another breakaway territory in neighboring Moldova) where Russian peacekeepers are present, he added.

Last week, former CIA officer and counterterrorism specialist Philip Giraldi told Sputnik that whatever officials say, it would be impossible to actually prevent US weapons in Ukraine from being used for offensive purposes. For example, ""on the ground, tank destroying missile systems would by their very nature be quite usable in an offensive, mobile fashion to neutralize any advantage in armor,"" he stressed.

Moreover, Giraldi warned that although the Pentagon might try to keep tabs on the weapons to prevent them from falling into the hands of unauthorized users, past experience has shown that such provisions are ""nearly impossible to enforce."" The situation on the ground in eastern Ukraine is not exactly cause for optimism, the analyst said, given the presence of local militias. Ukraine's use of mercenary fighters and so-called nationalist battalions is another concern.

The state-run news agency Xinhua reported that ""it was the first time China has marked Army Day, which formally falls on August 1, with a military parade since the Communist revolution in 1949.""

Speaking at the parade, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that the PLA ""is able to defeat any aggressor, and is determined to defend national sovereignty, security and the interests of the country.""

At the same time, the Chinese leader stressed that the PLA's main responsibility is to ensure that ordinary people can live in peace.

Macau-based military expert Anthony Wong Dong told the South China Morning Post that ""in the face of ongoing crises in the South China Sea and on the Korean Peninsula…the parade certainly became the show of China's military power.""

History of the PLA

The PLA was founded on August 1, 1927, during the Nanchang uprising against the then-ruling Kuomintang party. The later civil war resulted in founding the People's Republic of China in mainland China on October 1, 1949.

The latest turning point in the PLA's history happened in 2015, when Chinese authorities announced their intention to significantly reform their armed forces in order to increase the army's combat capability.

In this connection, on February 1, 2016, the PLA's structure was changed and its seven military districts were transformed into North, South, West, East and Central military command zones. All of these zones are under the command of the Central Military Commission, which is chaired by the Chinese President.

Another major restructuring of the PLA took place on January 11, 2016 which saw the establishment of the PLA Joint headquarters, due to be subordinate to the Central Military Council.

The start of military reforms was followed by the creation of missile and strategic forces within the PLA. At present, these forces, along with the land, air and naval forces as well as the People's Armed Police constitute the Chinese armed forces.

China's military spending is constantly on the increase and the country's defense budget is the world's second-largest after that of the US, according to media reports.

That could bump China's total military spending could approach $500 billion, according to some estimates. https://t.co/G7uOCOxcvW — NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) 29 июня 2017 г.

China's military budget in 2017 amounts to 1.3 percent of the country's GDP or 151.97 billion dollars. For comparison's sake, Washington has insisted that its NATO allies increase military spending to 2.0 percent of GDP, and the US itself spends over 600 billion dollars annually on defense.

En Route to Remote Shores

Right now, China is expanding its global military clout, which was something that became evident after a group of ships of the PLA's Navy left for Djibouti in July 2017 to build a logistics base near the Horn of Africa. The facility will be Beijing's first foreign military base.

Another look at China's new military base in Djiboutihttps://t.co/7l2mnGTJGJ — rhk111 Defense (@PhilDefNews) 31 июля 2017 г.

The Chinese Defense Ministry has repeatedly noted that the base will be used for peacekeeping operations, fighting piracy and delivering humanitarian aid. As the world's largest exporter of manufactured goods, China hopes to ensure the safety and reliability of nearby shipping lanes.

However, experts believe that base will help China protect its interests in the region and exert pressure on the countries that are of economic interest to Beijing.

Since 1990, China has also actively participated in UN peacekeeping missions. In 2012, about 2,000 Chinese military servicemen were involved in such missions, mainly in Africa."

© AFP 2017/ CLEMENS BILAN Main Pacifist of Europe? Why France Reduces Its Military Budget

France and Germany have drawn up a blueprint for ""permanent structural cooperation"" among the EU countries in defense matters, following last month's European Council meeting which discussed options for ""strategic autonomy"" in EU defense.

The joint report from the EU's most powerful members describes a ""long-term vision"" that participating states develop the ability of their armed forces to fully execute military tasks, the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, which has seen a copy of the document, reported on Sunday.

The new military capabilities will be developed ""in addition to NATO, which will continue to be the cornerstone of the collective defense of its members,"" the report added.

The proposal was formulated after last month's bilateral defense council meeting, at which Berlin and Paris agreed upon conditions under which countries should participate in the defense pact. These include a commitment to increase defense spending to ""approach"" the two percent demanded by NATO and to invest 20 percent of military spending on research, development, and equipment acquisition.

France and Germany also propose that member states' armed forces undergo an annual assessment by the European Defense Agency, whose powers will be significantly strengthened.

Jean-Vincent Brisset, a retired French army brigadier general and senior analyst at the Institut de Relations Internationales et Strategiques (IRIS) said that the European defense initiative is in its earliest of stages and needs political will to succeed.

""A lot of staff headquarters are discussing and thinking about these issues, but in practice not much is being done,"" he told Sputnik France.

""There are countries that unreservedly support NATO, who would prefer to maintain loyalty to it – I would not say that they are under its control, but they have a certain will to remain close to the United States instead of participating in [defense] cooperation of a purely European character.""

""At the moment, much is being said about the new position of French diplomacy. There a lot of words but not a lot of action … however, it could be that maybe now we can really make something happen in practice,"" Brisset said, more optimistically.

Dr. Caroline Galacteros, a political analyst and colonel in the French Army's operational reserve, told Sputnik France that the proposal is a timely move toward more defense autonomy from the US.

""This is a good initiative since it is being proposed at a time when the situation at both the European and international level is conducive to such initiatives. American foreign policy, US policy towards Europe is not easy to understand…The time has come for Europe should show that it has its own legitimacy with regard to strategic autonomy,"" Galacteros said.

""I am not privy to the details of the negotiations, but I think that there will probably be a consolidation of the costs of conducting external operations which today fall mainly on the shoulders of France despite the fact that such operations concerns the defense of all Europeans. Our operations in the Sahel are carried out with too little support from our European partners.""

France, Germany, Italy and others have expressed renewed interest in a pan-European defense initiative in recent years, especially in light of the UK's decision to leave the EU. The UK had been a staunch supporter of NATO and has continued to oppose a European defense union even after its decision to longer be a part of the EU.

""We are still full members of the European Union and we will resist any attempt to unnecessarily duplicate NATO structures. We remain committed to the security of the European continent,"" the UK Ministry of Defense stated in September last year.

Following the Brexit vote, France and Germany presented the Visegrad group of countries with a plan for a new-look European superstate including a ""European Security Compact"" dealing with all aspects of security and defense at the European level.

In February, Defense Minister Roberta Pinotti said that the EU should enhance its defense co-operation, independent of NATO. She suggested a ""two-speed"" Europe in defense as well as economic matters, including the implementation of a ""Defense Schengen"" that would strengthen cooperation between Italy, France, Germany and Spain."

Israel welcomes Russia’s efforts on the issue of de-escalation zones in Syria, but certain skepticism remains until the issue of the Iranian presence there is resolved, Israeli Ambassador to Russia Gary Koren told Sputnik.

MOSCOW (Sputnik)

""We value the work of Russia’s diplomacy. Very intensive, difficult work is underway here … in a momentary situation, we, of course, positively assess the Russian goals — the creation of zones of de-escalation. But until they bring specific results in terms of curtailing the Iranian presence, we will remain skeptical about the effectiveness of this policy. But I am now talking about the interests of Israel, naturally. Russia may have its own interests,"" Koren said.

Iran's further plans to restore Syria, to participate in investment projects are strategic in nature and directed against Israel, Koren noted.

""We are watching the Iranian agenda which it [Iran] does not hide. Iran is interested in controlling Syria. Iran has plans to establish a naval base in Tartus, in fact, it has got its own airport in eastern Syria, this might have already been endorsed by Syrian government,"" Koren added.

Koren reaffirmed that the main goal in Syria was to put an end to the bloodshed as at least half a million people had died in Syria. The Israeli ambassador also pointed out that for Israeli state, Iran and its allies remained a principal threat in Syria, as the Hezbollah movement fighters and other Shiite militias were fighting alongside Iranian forces and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

Hezbollah, considered by Israel as a terrorist organization, was established in the 1980s in Lebanon. Both Tehran and Hezbollah have been supporting the Syrian government in its fight against terrorist groups inside the country."

On Monday, US Vice President Mike Pence said that President Donald Trump will soon sign into law new legislation that enhances US sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea.

The relevant bill was passed by an overwhelming majority of 419 to 3 in the House of Representatives and by 98 to two in the Senate.

The bill slaps new financial sanctions on Russia, while also imposing additional restrictive measures against the Iranian missile program and the shipping industry of North Korea.

In light of this, many wonder what will happen if strategic allies Iran and Russia are able to reach a consensus with North Korea on creating a trilateral alliance against American ambitions and sanctions.

Pyongyang would most likely refuse to join this coalition, while Iran and Russia may form a new alliance in the Middle East, according to Tayeri.

""If we want to duly respond to the US sanctions, then North Korea has nothing to do with it. It is necessary to take into account the political regime of this country and the fact that it does not have any status in the Middle East,"" Tayeri said.

""By slapping sanctions on Iran, the US wants to put pressure on Iran and weaken its military power,"" he added, referring to North Korea's recent ballistic missile launch, which he said proves that Pyongyang ""can strike America.""

""The position of Iran and Russia is quite different. We see Moscow and Tehran as allies that can form a new alliance in the Middle East,"" Tayeri said, adding that ""Iran and Russia have always acted together in the international arena.""

Referring to retaliation against the US sanctions, he said that ""in the future, we will see that North Korea will be unable to play a significant role in this process because Pyongyang only has the strength and ability to maneuver within the Korean Peninsula.""

""Unlike North Korea, Iran and Russia have a positive influence in the Middle East and even in Eastern Europe. Therefore, if a coalition is created, Iran and Russia would become [full-fledged] members while North Korea would be given a minor role,"" Tayeri said.

Adding that ""Pyongyang wants to negotiate with an atomic bomb in possession,"" Tayeri expressed hope for ""Iran's and Russia's diplomatic negotiations with America.""

Another Iranian political analyst, Mahmoud Shuri, told Sputnik Iran that Russia, North Korea and Iran ""were at different times and for various reasons subjected to sanctions by the US which is why it is clear that they will try to respond in kind to these restrictive measures.""

In this vein, Shuri described Russia as ""a country which has the status of a great world power and membership in the UN Security Council,"" and which has ""great possibilities to resist the US sanctions at the diplomatic level.""

""Iran, too, has accumulated a large anti-sanctions experience in the past few years when struggling for its nuclear program,"" he said.

""We must resist together and to that end, we need to create a common front to show America that its actions run counter to international laws. Unfortunately, the possibilities and methods of our influence are limited, but we should not, therefore, step back from the struggle against the US sanctions,"" Shuri concluded."

© AFP 2017/ TOSHIFUMI KITAMURA Okinawa Government Files New Lawsuit Over US Air Base Relocation

Construction work to lay the foundations for a new US Marine Corps airbase on the island of Okinawa has hit a snag after local authorities launched another legal bid to stop the work, which has been approved by the Japanese defense ministry but bitterly opposed by local people.

The government of Okinawa prefecture lodged a legal complaint in the Naha district court on July 24, citing environmental concerns. It is the fifth time that the local government has filed a lawsuit to prevent the construction of the base close to the coastal town of Nago, Henoko Bay. The new airbase will relocate US troops who are currently stationed at the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, located in Ginowan City.

Okinawans have campaigned for the closure of the Futenma base for decades because of security risks posed by the troops' presence. The southwestern Japanese island hosts about half of the US military personnel in Japan, of which there are over 50,000 in total, as well as 40,000 dependents and another 5,500 American civilians employed there by the US Department of Defense.

Okinawa was conquered by the United States during a grueling three-month campaign in early 1945. Over a quarter million US servicemen fought to take the archipelago, which had a prewar civilian population of about 300,000, approximately half of whom were killed or committed suicide. The US ruled Okinawa as a military outpost until 1972, when control was returned to Japan; however, 40 years later, 32 US military bases remained on the island.

Criminal acts committed by US troops against the local population, including rape and robbery, have hardened opinions against the presence of the troops. As a result, the US military and the Japanese government have pledged to relocate the base from Ginowan to a less sparsely populated location, but many locals want to see the base construction plans scrapped altogether.

Despite protests, in April the Japanese government began constructing seawalls for the replacement facility in the coastal area of Nago. The government is dumping building materials into the sea and plans to launch full-fledged landfill work inside the seawalls possibly in the first half of next year, Kyodo reported.

Tamada Masaya, general secretary of the National Association of Dockworkers Unions, told Sputnik that not only do local people fear the threat from US servicemen, they are also worried about the threat of war.

As public demonstrators have had little impact on the plans, protestors are trying different tactics to stall the relocation to the port of Nago. The Japanese dockworkers' association regards the construction of the new base as illegal and is calling on dockworkers across Japan to refuse to participate in the delivery of building materials, Masaya explained.

""Port workers carry out transportation of the material, and they must not be allowed to participate in illegal activities. These kinds of activities do great harm to our colleagues in Okinawa,"" the official said.

""In the long term, construction of the military base could drag us into a war. As a rule, when hostilities begin a port becomes the place where weapons and supplies are delivered and such a base could well become the object of a military attack.""

""As a result, port workers who are not servicemen will be the first victims of the attack. The possibility of such a development of events should alarm us today. Port workers must do their utmost to prevent being drawn into a war. We must not forget that such a danger threatens primarily the port workers of Okinawa, and they understand this well,"" Masaya said."

A number of people were reported killed during protests that broke out during the vote. A group of foreign countries, including the United States, have opposed the vote and refused to recognize its results.

Maduro is not the first leader, who has been sanctioned by foreign powers for certain activities.

On January 17, Washington sanctioned President Milorad Dodik of Republika Srpska, which is one of two entities comprising Bosnia and Herzegovina, for blocking the Dayton Peace Accords reached in 1995.

On July 16, 2016, the United States imposed sanctions on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un along with 22 other country's officials and organizations citing their alleged responsibility for violation of human rights.

On May 13, 2014, then-US President Barack Obama put a group of five politicians from the Central African Republic on the sanctions list due to their involvement in violence and human rights abuses. The restrictions targeted former country's president Francois Bozize, who was toppled in 2013. Nourredine Adam, who was the country's ex-minister of public security, and Levy Yakete, the leader of Christian rebels fighting against Islamists in the African state, were also sanctioned.

On May 18, 2011, the United States imposed sanctions against Syrian President Bashar Assad due to violations of human rights in the Middle Eastern nation. In April, Washington also imposed unilateral sanctions on several Syrian officials and state institutions, however they had not targeted Assad.

On April 7, 2011, the European Union imposed additional sanctions against the leadership of Cote d'Ivoire due to the deterioration of the situation in the African nation. Brussels decided to prohibit the purchase of bonds and securities to the illegitimate government of former President Laurent Gbagbo, who refused to transfer power to his presidential rival Alassane Ouattara.

On March 24, 2006, the EU leaders approved the sanctions against Belarusian authorities, including the country's President Alexander Lukashenko. The EU foreign ministers have also worked out a ""black list"" of Belarusian officials complicating issuing of Schengen visas for them.

In 2001, the United States introduced anti-Zimbabwean sanctions. The European Union has also targeted the African nation with both personal and economic sanctions in the 2000s, prolonging them for several times. However, the Council of the European Union started lifting the restrictions and by 2014, only the country's President Robert Mugabe, his wife and the Zimbabwe Defense Industries arms supplier were on the sanctions list."

The station under construction will be 3-story high and have a 36,000 square meters floor area, including platform, entrance and exit. The railway tracks will be 102 meters underground.

The station is an important part of a 12.01 kilometers long tunnel section of the 174-kilometer Beijing–Zhangjiakou high-speed railway line. The tunnel is the longest one of the railway line.

""Passengers will enter and exit the station about 100 meters underground, and it will be very safe,"" said Dai Longzhen, a senior manager of the construction company China Railway No 5 Engineering Group Co Ltd.

An escalator would raise passengers 62 meters at vertical height, and inclined elevators will also be used in the station for the first time.

To secure the safety of passengers, the station will change the inclined shafts that are used to build the station as permanent rescue channels.

The underground burrowing work is the country's most complicated, because the station has to contain 78 caverns and lots of intersections, said Chen Bin, a commander-in-chief of the project.

Starting from the construction of the tunnel on April 15, 2016, workers have known how tough the work will be, however the hardness of the rocks still exceeded their expectations, said Jiang Si, a manager of the company.

According to its initial plan, workers could excavate the tunnel 6 to 8 meters a day, but the tough rock meant workers could dig only about 2 meters a day.

Large–size shield tunneling machines could not be used, and workers could only use the blasting method in the construction, Dai said.

""The No 1 shaft has a 80-degree turn, and the No 2 shaft has a 135-degree turn, which prohibits the machines more than 100 meters long from working there,"" Dai said.

Workers have to develop new blasting technology to explore the tunnel carefully, because just above it are the Great Wall and the railway line linking Beijing and Zhangjiakou first independently designed and built by Chinese 100 years ago.

Workers have carried out more than 4,500 explosions. They use the electronic detonators to control the vibrations in batches of small explosions to reduce the impacts on the inside of hills and the Great Wall. At the Qinglongqiao station of old Beijing-Zhangjiakou railway line, worker used expansive agents to dig the tunnel, only 4 meters beneath.

Another problem in the tunneling is the underground water, and every day, workers have to pump at least 19,000 cubic meters of water, which equals about 10 swimming pools.

The Bejing-Zhangjiakou high-speed railway is expected to get through by the end of 2019, allowing passengers to travel between the two cities in one hour. It is an important project for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games.

But prosecutor Ron O’Brien says it’s far too soon to blame the jurors — or to talk about arranging a new trial.

""Until the sheriff’s office completes its review, there’s no reason to believe anything went awry with the jury,"" O’Brien told the Dispatch Thursday. ""And no matter what happens, it shouldn’t affect the fact that the evidence showed that [the defendant] possessed the drugs [during his arrest in January 2016].""

Moore said the jury quickly deemed Edwards guilty, ""so they could get out of the Franklin County courthouse before it was noticed that the oxycodone pills were missing.""

While the Franklin County Sheriff’s Office continues to investigate and review surveillance footage, officials have begun discussing how to better handle drug evidence during jury deliberations.

Judge Stephen L. McIntosh, the court’s administrative judge, says that depending on the case, jurors should be given photos of the drugs rather than the actual evidence.

Surprisingly enough, none of the other samples, which included a sizable amount of heroin and methamphetamines, did not go missing, O’Brien added.

The pills were first marked as missing when the manila envelope stored inside a locked box, which is also kept inside a locked courthouse office, was discovered empty on July 21, a day after the trial concluded.

Considering the jury took two breaks during deliberations, the pills could have been left unattended, which would have allowed the culprit to make it out with the drugs in hand.

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — ""We write to express concern and seek information related to the decision made by the White House to publish emails containing personal information of citizens that wrote to the President’s Advisory Commission on Election Integrity,"" the letter said on Monday.

On July 13, the White House made public more than 100 pages of emails related to the voter fraud investigation. The names, phone numbers and addresses of senders were not redacted.

The senators — Sherrod Brown, Dianne Feinstein, and Ron Wyden — argued that the disclosure showed ""a lack of sensitivity to and simple disregard"" for concerns expressed in the correspondence to the Election Commission.

In the letter, they demanded answers about the administration's policy for publishing personal information contained in communications to the White House and whether citizens who were affected by the decision have received any public notice prior to the release. Moreover, the senators asked whether there were any guarantees future comments from citizens would be protected.

On May 11, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to establish an Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, and ordered the commission to issue a report laying out the vulnerabilities in voting systems and other practices that could lead to fraudulent voter registration or voting."

The USS Rafael Peralta was commissioned into service at the 32nd Street Naval Station in San Diego, California. The ship’s namesake refers to former US Marine Rafael Peralta who sacrificed his life during the second battle of Fallujah by jumping on a grenade that killed him instantly but saved the lives of fellow service members, the US Navy said in an announcement Monday.

Peralta immigrated to the US from Mexico in 1997. He joined the Marine Corps immediately upon being granted a green card, the US Navy said.

""This is more than just another commissioning,"" Gen. Robert Neller said during the principal address. ""It marks the commemoration of a law and the immortality of a hero,"" the Marine Corps commandant said.

The US Navy destroyer is equipped with helicopter landing pads, Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles, the AEGIS weapon system, Tomahawk land-attack missiles, an anti-submarine weapons system and advanced anti-air missiles.

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency entered into an agreement with 18 counties in the state of Texas that will allow local law enforcement officers to carry out the same functions as federal immigration officers, Acting ICE Director Tom Homan said at an event in the state.

""By partnering with ICE’s 287(g) program, each of these counties will be able to identify criminal aliens in their jails and turn them over to ICE, once their criminal process is complete,"" Homan stated on Monday.

In February, then-Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly authorized that the partnership authorized by section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act be expanded to any willing and qualified state or local law enforcement jurisdiction.

The program allows local law enforcement officers, including police and sheriffs, to identify people they have already arrested as being in the United States illegally, and detain them in local jails for possible deportation from the country.

Officers participating in the program must be US citizens, complete a background check, have experience in their current position and have no pending disciplinary actions.

ICE noted that it now has 60 active 287(g) agreements, nearly double the number of active programs in 2016."

Beijing police said in a statement on Monday night that certain members of the company, Shanxinhui, were egged on by people with ulterior motives to participate in an illegal gathering on Monday and seriously disturb the capital's social order. Their gathering is suspected of breaking the law.

Zhang Tianming, the company's legal representative, and others have been put under ""coercive measures"" on suspicion of organizing and leading a pyramid scheme previously.

Police succeeded in persuading participants to disperse and those believed to have led the illegal gathering and refused to obey police orders have been taken away for further investigation, the statement said. ""Those who instigate or organize illegal gathering and who participate in such gathering will be punished by law,"" it said.

The Xinhua News Agency cited the Ministry of Public Security as saying on Friday that police accused Zhang and others of plotting, manipulating and persuading people into taking part in a pyramid scheme disguised as a charity for the poor, and swindled them of huge amounts of money. The ministry said pyramid schemes are often disguised as charities, false currency, e-commerce and WeChat marketing.

The opening-up of Tibet is in line with the general trend, but due to some historical and geopolitical factors, it has had to face some special challenges involving international strategy and security in the process of its development.

First, India's attitude toward the B&R is not conducive to Tibet's involvement in the initiative. Among countries and regions along the route of the B&R, India is the only large economy that has yet to express public support for the initiative. Given this situation, India is unlikely to consider building a railway linking it to the autonomous region.

Second, Sino-Indian border trade is underdeveloped, which is a serious barrier to developing Tibet's trade. More than 90 percent of trade between India and the autonomous region, which border one another, passes through the port of Tianjin in North China, which is 4,400 kilometers away.

Third, Nepal's internal politics may thwart the interconnection of the two countries' infrastructure. In contrast to what Indian media outlets have reported, Nepal does have an interest in China's B&R initiative, but the Himalayan country has misgivings about ramping up efforts to carry out the agreement reached by its former prime minister, KP Sharma Oli, who had a pro-China stance. He agreed to speed up the interconnection and strengthen cooperation with China, but this process may be held up due to India's attitude toward the B&R.

With economic integration between Tibet and the rest of China a major way for the region to play a more active role in the B&R initiative, China should create a favorable international environment for itself to speed up the interconnection with South Asian countries and make Tibet a bridgehead for that process.

First, Tibet could continue to improve its infrastructure, including roads, telecom facilities and land border ports.

Second, while setting the stage for strategic interaction with India, China should focus on cooperation with the state governments of India and major companies there. These parties are always significantly less interested in geopolitics than national governments. There is a strong desire among state governments in India to promote local economic development, while heads of local government departments care about their individual political careers relating to economic growth.

Many investment promotion delegations led by chief ministers of Indian states have visited China to attract investment, and these events offer a shortcut for the B&R initiative to establish a presence in India. China needs to strengthen cooperation with state governments in northeast India such as Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh.

Third, China should become a dependable friend of Nepal. Although political uncertainty persists, Nepal is the best option for Tibet's opening-up and interconnection with the outside. Since the early 1990s, ""striking a balance"" has been a principle of the foreign policy pursued by Nepal, on the basis of a rise in nationalism and anti-India sentiment.

Events such as an undeclared economic blockade by India, which led to shortages of fuel, medicine and other supplies in Nepal, have led most Nepali people to abandon their illusions about India. Although India maintains a considerable presence in Nepal, this does not necessarily mean that the smaller nation is unwilling to change the status quo, although its internal political disputes diminish its solidarity. China has no intention of competing with India in Nepal; rather, what China hopes to achieve is that Nepal and other neighboring countries can get a free ride on China's economic rise.

China hopes that Nepal can serve as a bridge to India, which means that China needs to speed up interconnection with Nepal first. China should strengthen cooperation with Nepal in terms of the economy and infrastructure, and enhance political and cultural exchanges.

Fourth, we must optimize local industries in Tibet to make it an important node for the B&R initiative. We should take the opportunity to promote specialized industry development, focus on improving the environment and pursue natural and cultural heritage protection.

In addition, as Tibet is close to South Asia, we may also make full use of the unique advantages of Tibet in geography and humanities to boost the local financial industry.

Finally, in participation in the B&R initiative, Tibet must pay attention to connections to people in surrounding countries and regions.

© AP Photo/ Carolyn Kaster Another Shake Up: White House Communications Director Scaramucci Out After 10 Days

White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci resigned from his position on Monday after a tumultuous ten days in charge. US President Donald Trump and his new Chief of Staff General John Kelly requested Scaramucci's resignation after he aired profanity-laced tirades about other members of the Trump administration.

Scaramucci repeatedly clashed with now-fired Chief of Staff Reince Preibus. He had a colorful interview with The New Yorker in which he claimed he wasn't like White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon because he didn't ""try to suck his own d*ck."" In the same interview, ""The Mooch"" called Preibus a ""f*cking paranoid schizophrenic.""

According to the New York Times, the removal of Scaramucci, nicknamed ""the Mooch,"" was at the request of Kelly, a four-star general who has undertaken to bring unruly elements of the White House into line.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders explained that the President had felt that Scaramucci's remarks were ""inappropriate.""

""The President certainly felt that Anthony's comments were inappropriate for a person in that position and he didn't want to burden General Kelly,"" Sanders told a briefing on Monday.

Nikita Danyuk, assistant director at the Institute for Strategic Studies and Predictions of the Peoples' Friendship University of Russia, told Radio Sputnik that the President had turned to Scaramucci because he was a fierce Trump loyalist who promised to fight for his boss in a way that his predecessor Sean Spicer couldn't.

""Scaramucci is a unique case: this person has never been a specialist in journalism, communications or PR, this is a man from the world of finance. The fact that he appointed himself a fierce fighter against those who are 'leaking' information from the White House helped him to earn the support of Donald Trump. However, his inability to control his behavior and communicate with journalists gave rise to this scandal, which convinced Donald Trump that this person does not possess the right professional qualities and brought discord to the White House instead of rallying it,"" Danyuk said.

""Scaramucci had to report not to the White House chief of staff, but to Donald Trump. That is, in a sense Donald Trump gave him carte blanche and instead of using this opportunity wisely, this guy literally in the first few days initiated a scandal. That's why John Kelly, whose main aim is now to consolidate the White House, took the correct decision and dismissed Scaramucci. But at the same time, I am sure that Donald Trump approved it [the decision].""

Danyuk said that the White House reshuffle is an attempt by Trump to improve his currently testy relationship with the press.

""I think the main reason for this game of musical chairs among the staff is that Donald Trump sees the problem not in his politics and not in his management style, but in the absence of proper communication, including with journalists.""

The appointment of General John Kelly should impose more discipline in the White House but while Kelly may be able to steady the ship, others could nevertheless decide to jump from Trump's administration, Danyuk said.

""As for further moves, I am sure that John Kelly, who is very experienced, will try to consolidate the White House team and more departures in the near future are not to be expected. Nevertheless, taking into account that there is an investigation going on about the Trump campaign, that he is at risk of impeachment, there might be some departures. People who think strategically realize that it's better to leave a ship before it sinks,"" Danyuk said."

Earlier this week, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said that US President Donald Trump has yet to decide on whether or not to slap a new round of sanctions against Russia.

""There is still time. Obviously, President Trump has not yet decided whether he will tighten the anti-Russian sanctions,"" media reports quoted Gabriel as saying.

""In any case, the law stipulates [the US] holding preliminary consultations with us Europeans, before this can happen,"" Gabriel said, referring to the possible imposition of the new anti-Russian sanctions.

He pledged to use this opportunity for the discussion while in close contact with [US Secretary of State] Rex Tillerson.""

Gabriel also stressed that the goal of the sanctions is to end the Ukrainian crisis and exert political pressure, something that he said could be implemented if ""we act together and cohesively.""

At the same time, he promised to rebuff the industrial policy of the United States that it pursues under the cover of sanctions.

Speaking to Sputnik, Russian political analyst Alexey Zudin noted that for the first time in many years, the US's anti-Russian actions caused an uproar in Europe.

""Perhaps for the first time in post-Soviet history, the EU expressed dissatisfaction regarding Washington's restrictive measures against Russia after it became clear that the sanctions would be slapped and that they would seriously affect European companies and the EU economy. EU officials made rather stern statements that the US's actions are unacceptable, even saying that the EU isn't ruling out retaliatory measures,"" Zudin said.

He added that ""the current situation envisaged that there will be this situation's next round which will see negotiations between the US and the European Union on these new anti-Russian sanctions.""

Zudin singled out at least two major aspects pertaining to the matter.

""The main thing is whether such negotiations will finally take place and secondly, many wonder whether Europe will accept possible [the sanctions-related] concessions from Trump and whether there will be any such concessions at all. This is where a new intrigue lies,"" he concluded.

Earlier, German Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries lashed out at the US's anti-Russian sanctions program, saying that it violates international law and punishes European firms; Zypries called on the European Union to consider countermeasures against Washington.

""We consider this as being against international law, plain and simple. The Americans can't punish German companies because they have business interests in another country, but unfortunately that is exactly what they are doing. That means that it is right that the European Commission now considers countermeasures,"" she said.

The latest sanctions bill will fine businesses for helping Moscow expand and enhance its energy export pipelines, theoretically leaving European energy firms open to incurring harsh penalties for having ties to Russian companies.

Of particular concern to Zypries is Nord Stream 2, a pipeline project aimed at pumping Russian natural gas to Europe via the Baltic Sea to landfall in Germany. The project is being spearheaded by Gazprom, and supported by a number of European partners, including Germany's Wintershall and Austria's OMV."

White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders, for her part, said that ""right now we're reviewing our options, and when we have something to say on it, we'll let you know,"" according to the Washington Post newspaper.

Six days after the US House of Representatives approved an anti-Russian sanctions package on July 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that the diplomatic presence of the United States in Russia would be cut by 755 people to 455, the same number of diplomatic personnel that Russia currently has in the US.

US new anti-Russian sanctions point a dagger at the heart of Europe https://t.co/vgpNjJQFVW pic.twitter.com/5WkzaLb5e7 — johnpete10 (@johnpete1010) 30 июля 2017 г.

In an interview with Russia's Rossiya 1 TV channel, Putin explained why Moscow had responded to the US sanctions bill.

""The US side again undertook an unprovoked — which is very important — step toward the deterioration of Russian-American relations: on illegal restrictions, on an attempt to influence other countries of the world, including its allies who are interested in developing and maintaining relations with Russia,"" he said.

He added that ""we waited for quite some time that maybe something would change for the better, had such hope, that the situation will somehow change, but, apparently, if it changes, it [won't happen] so soon.""

""I'm not talking about all sorts of reasons of internal political character within the United States itself. But we must, I decided, show that we will not leave anything without an answer,"" Putin pointed out.

Speaking to Sputnik, expert Dmitry Ofitserov-Belsky of the Moscow-based Higher School of Economics described the Kremlin cutting the US diplomatic presence in Russia as a completely justified decision.

""Russia had to show that firstly, it was ready to respond and secondly, that if the US offers a scenario where the conflict escalates, Russia is able to survive this tension and does not agree to surrender,"" Ofitserov-Belsky said.

""In the long run, Moscow's statement on the expulsion of American diplomats and embassy workers, in fact, means that Russia can do without relations with the US on a whole array of issues,"" according to him.

""This measure is not discriminatory and it does not violate any aspects of our [Russian-US] relations. It's just a freezing measure, something that adds to its demonstrative goal,"" he added.

According to the expert, the US in its actions is guided primarily by its own economic interests, which is once again confirmed by the new anti-Russian sanctions bill.

""Regardless of which part of the elite is currently in power in the United States, there is little change in the situation so you should neither be angry with the Americans over the policy they are pursuing nor harbor any illusions,"" Ofitserov-Belsky said.

""The new sanctions are expected to be used against Russian energy companies in order to block the strengthening of Russia's positions in the European energy market. I mean, first of all, the Nord Stream 2 [gas pipeline project],"" he added.

So in this case, the United States proceeded from its own economic interests,"" Dmitry Ofitserov-Belsky said, citing the ""nothing-personal-only-business"" saying.

The Grenfell Tower fire tore a community apart. In the days after the tragedy, missing picture posters of loved ones filled the streets.

However one month on, as bodies are identified and funerals take place, people are slowly coming to terms with their loss and the fact that this fire, which killed at least 80 people, really did happen.

The latest body to be identified was that of two-year-old Jeremiah Deen.

​Many of the survivors and family members of people who perished are suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) which is defined as an anxiety disorder caused by a very ""stressful, frightening or distressing event.""

Judy Bolton, a clinical nurse and coordinator of the Justice for Grenfell campaign told Sputnik that the help from local and national government has been minimal and more needs to be done to ensure those suffering from PTSD are helped.

""The UK government or gold command has said they will provide mental health services, to those who are traumatized and obviously in a terrible state. But they are expected to go to them and access these services. So it's not a referral, it's if you feel that you need mental health support, you have to go to them, which beggars belief as many people wouldn't recognize or even know the symptoms of stress, distress, trauma or suicide,"" Ms. Bolton told Sputnik.

​""This is an unprecedented event and I would have hoped that the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea would have actually seen the need to go to the survivors and bereaved families because they also are traumatized as well,"" Ms. Bolton added.

Judy Bolton is all too familiar with the symptoms of PTSD, as a trained clinical nurse, Ms. Bolton has seen the impact of the condition, comparing it to the grieving process.

People will be in denial, many will still be living in disbelief that this has happened, but soon the realization kicks in and the person, unable to cope with their loss and the situation, isolates themselves and stops talking in a bid to deal with the pain.

""With PTSD you are not able to rationally process, it's too much, and so people will go into themselves. Also they will go through erratic sleeping, sometimes not even sleeping. Also anxiety — it can paralyze you… You may see someone withdrawn and zapped out in a chair, not moving or blinking and they are locked in their own trauma,"" Ms. Bolton told Sputnik.

""I spoke to one gentlemen, he has worked all his life… he saved his partner and child from the fire, but now he has to sleep with the light on because he is scared to go to the bathroom at night,"" Ms Bolton said.

Signs of PTSD are palpitations, difficulty breathing, dizziness, sweating of hands and face. Ms. Bolton said people will also have an irrational fear of going outside and may develop agoraphobia.

Several reports of people trying to commit suicide have recently surfaced. Ms. Bolton is unable to discuss the details in order to protect people's privacy, but she says the trauma of surviving the fire has led many to want to commit suicide or self-medicate with drugs.

""The police are very aware of the drug dealers in the area. They are very aware of certain outlets that provide illicit drugs […]. We have had an influx of people outside of the area coming in to capitalize on the misery. Again those who seek to capitalize only have to ask questions, the drug dealers are more organized than gold command. Again, it's down to Notting Hill police to ensure they go to the outlets and shut these things down,"" Ms. Bolton told Sputnik

With cuts being made to every area of mental health, accessing support is not easy.

Ms. Bolton commends the local services that have helped thus far, but says waiting times are so long that support has had to be provided by the community.

""We have volunteers who go out at night and help those who can't sleep. Even at 3am you see people walking the streets as they can't sleep. So you have volunteers who will help people and talk to them.

""What we need is a safe place that is accessible 24 hours a day for people to be able to come and help, and receive help [….] People are in a real state and it's a collective state of PTSD,"" Ms. Bolton concluded.

If you know of someone suffering from PTSD since the Grenfell Tower incident, please contact the Justice for Grenfell website or the Samaritans."

The Russian website paralay.iboards.ru published a photo of a heavy Russian unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which is being developed by the country's Sukhoi company in accordance with the Okhotnik-B project. Sukhoi is a major Russian aircraft manufacturer, headquartered in Moscow.

With characteristics of the new strike drone yet to be disclosed, it was reported that the 20-ton UAV will be equipped with stealth technologies of the new Russian fifth-generation T-50 PAK FA fighter jet and will be capable of flying as a sixth-generation fighter.

Flight tests of the Okhotnik-B are due to begin already in 2018, and in 2020 it is expected to enter service with the Russian Armed Forces.

Judging by the Okhotnik-B photo, the drone is being developed in line with the ""flying wing"" scheme stipulating a three-column chassis. In the same way, the Skat drone was created by the Russian aircraft corporation MiG in the 1990s, something that prompted experts to suggest that some Skat technologies may be used in the Okhotnik-B.

According to unconfirmed reports, the range of the Russian heavy drone will stand at about 6,000 kilometers. It means that the UAV may be equipped with the turbojet two-circuit engine AL-31F, which is used in the Russian fighters of the Su-27 family.

In an interview with Sputnik, Russian military expert Denis Fedutinov, for his part, suggested that the Okhotnik-B's silhouette may look like that of reconnaissance and strike drones developed by European and US companies.

""Judging by data on the Okhotnik-B's takeoff weight, it is safe to assume that its characteristics will be similar to those of the US drone X-47B developed by Northrop Grumman. It can fly at high subsonic speeds, operating within a radius of up to 4,000 kilometers and carrying a diverse target load, including the strike one which weighs up to 2 tons,"" Fedutinov said.

Earlier, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin told Sputnik that Russia had swiftly reduced, and is expected to completely eliminate, its lag behind the United States and Israel in the creation of UAVs.

""Concerning the UAVs I should only say that there is no point of speaking about some lagging behind. It has been rapidly reduced and will be completely eliminated soon,"" Rogozin said in an interview.

He specified that he was speaking about both combat and reconnaissance drones."

According to the observer, US policies ""are aimed at escalating the confrontation in the Donbass, and trying to draw Russia into a protracted armed conflict.

In this situation, Khrolenko warned the near future do not promise to be a peaceful one for Moscow; ""this is evidenced by both the words and deeds of our partners.""

Last week, after paying a visit to the Donbass, US State Department special Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker suggested that Washington should provide Kiev with lethal weapons to ""stop Russia."" Volker's remarks were significant, Khrolenko noted, because it's very difficult to achieve peace when the diplomats charged with doing so are running around talking about handing out weapons.

According to the journalist, it was hardly worth expecting anything else from Volker, who is a long-time John McCain ally and opponent of Russia. Before his appointment, Volker voiced his support for providing the Ukrainian military with intelligence, anti-tank weapons, and artillery systems. In the summer of 2015, Volker slammed the Minsk ceasefire agreements, describing them not as ""a solution, but a problem, because they factually give legitimacy to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.""

Unfortunately, Khrolenko warned that with his newfound status as the special representative on Ukraine, Volker's appearance may be an indication that Washington hawks and 'moderates' may have come to some sort of an agreement on the idea of ""putting Russia in its place,"" and if that's the case, ""this is not good news for Ukraine.""

After all, ""for some reason, in all the countries where the US helps 'fight for justice', bombs have a tendency of always falling. And any preparations (or army rearmament) of local forces by US or NATO structures, as a rule, entails new complications in the affected regions.""

Also last week, US lawmakers approved a new, powerful package of sanctions against Russia. These measures, according to Khrolenko, are intended to help ""subordinate Russia, both economically and politically, and then dismantle its sovereignty and create a comfortable, amorphous (or fragmented) formation in its place as a raw materials appendage to Washington.""

""From here come the systemic attempts to deform Russian statehood. For the time being this is done using relatively mild forms – through sanctions, an international campaign of disinformation, the financing of Russia's grant-munching pseudo-opposition forces and NGOs, etc. But the technology of blood-stained Maidans does is not without relevance. Undoubtedly, all of this is a form of hybrid aggression, to which Russia has responded in a very restrained fashion.""

But the logical question which must be asked, according to the journalist, is simply ""What's next?""

""On the one hand, Russia's military capabilities hinder the flight of the US hawks; the confrontation may drag on for many years, and end for naught for Washington. On the other hand, Moscow and Washington are dangerously drawn into…zones of hot wars (in Europe, the Middle East or the Far East).

As far as Ukraine was concerned, Khrolenko warned that as the US and its allies continue rearming, reshaping and reorganizing the country's military along NATO standards, while the failure of the Minsk agreements to succeed with their primary responsibility (keeping the peace) becomes more and more of a possibility with each passing day, Moscow faces losing the initiative.

© AFP 2017/ Mark RALSTON Empire of Whiners

With an Orwellian 99% majority that would delight the Kim dynasty in North Korea, the ""representative democracy"" Capitol Hill has bulldozed its latest House/Senate sanctions package , aimed mostly at Russia, but also targeting Iran and North Korea.

The White House's announcement — late Friday afternoon in the middle of summer — that President Trump has approved and will sign the bill was literally buried in the news cycle amidst the proverbial 24/7 Russia-gate related hysteria.

Trump will be required to justify to Congress, in writing, any initiative to ease sanctions on Russia. And Congress is entitled to launch an automatic review of any such initiative.

Translation; the death knell of any possibility for the White House to reset relations with Russia. Congress in fact is just ratifying the ongoing Russia demonization campaign orchestrated by the neocon and neoliberalcon deep state/War Party establishment.

Economic war has been declared against Russia for at least three years now. The difference is this latest package also declares economic war against Europe, especially Germany.

That centers on the energy front, by demonizing the implementation of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and forcing the EU to buy US natural gas.

Make no mistake; the EU leadership will counterpunch. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission (EC), put it mildly when he said, ""America first cannot mean that Europe's interests come last.""

On the Russia front, what the Empire of Sanctions faces does not even qualify as a hollow victory. Kommersant has reported that Moscow, among other actions, will retaliate by banning all American IT companies and all US agricultural products from the Russian market, as well as exporting titanium to Boeing (30% of which comes from Russia).

On the Russia-China strategic partnership front, trying to restrict Russia-EU energy deals will only allow more currency swaps between the ruble and the yuan; a key plank of the post-US dollar multipolar world.

And then there's the possible, major game-changer; the German front.

The Fools on the Hill

Even without considering the stellar historical record of Washington not only meddling but bombing and regime-changing vast swathes of the planet — from Iraq and Libya to the current threats against Iran, Venezuela and North Korea — the Russia-gate hysteria about meddling in the 2016 US presidential election is a non-story, by now thoroughly debunked.

The heart of the matter is, once again, energy wars.

According to a Middle East-based US energy source not hostage to the Beltway consensus, ""the message in these sanctions is the EU has no future unless it buys US natural gas to cut out Russia. To deny Russia the natural gas market of the EU was the goal behind the just lost war in Syria to put the Qatar-Saudi Arabia-Syria-Turkey-EU pipeline in and the opening to Iran for an Iran-Iraq-Syria-Turkey-EU pipeline. None of these plans worked.""

The source adds as evidence the 2014 oil price war against Russia, orchestrated by ""the dumping of Gulf States' surplus oil or reserve capacity on the world market. Since this has failed to bring Russia to its knees, the destruction of the Russian natural gas market in the EU has become a national priority for the United States.""

As it stands, 30% of all EU oil and natural gas imports come from Russia. In parallel, the Russia-China energy partnership is being progressively enhanced. Russia is already geared to increase oil and gas exports to China and Asia as a whole.

The leadership in Berlin is now convinced that Washington is jeopardizing Germany's energy diversification/energy security via the sanctions war. Russian natural gas and oil is secured by overland routes and is not dependent on the oceans, which, as the energy source stresses, ""are no longer under United States control. If Russia in response to United States belligerency drops an Iron Curtain over Europe, and redirects all its natural gas and oil exports to China and Asia, Europe will be utterly dependent on largely insecure sources of natural gas and oil such as the Middle East and Africa.""

And that bring us to the ""nuclear"" possibility in the horizon; a Germany-Russia alignment in a Reinsurance Treaty, as first established by Bismarck. CIA-related US Think Tankland is now actively discussing the possibility.

Another US business/political source, also a practitioner of thinking outside the (Beltway) box, stresses, ""this is what it's all about. That is the true goal of Russia, and the United States has fallen into the trap. The United States has had enough of Germany and what it considers dumping of German products on the United States through rigged currency. They are now threatening Germany with sanctions, and there is nothing Germany can do with the EU on their back facing vetoes from Poland, who is giving them trouble once again. The fools in Congress are really going after Germany, and throwing Germany in the arms of Russia.""

The US as the New Carthage

A possible Germany-Russia alliance, as I've written before, rounds up the China/Russia/Germany entente capable of reorganizing the entire Eurasian land mass.

The Russia-China strategic partnership is extremely attractive to German business, as it smoothes access via the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). According to the business/political source, ""the US is at war with China and Russia (but not Trump, our President) and Germany is having second thoughts about being nuclear cannon fodder for the US. I have discussed this in Germany, and they are thinking of renewing the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia. No one trusts this US Congress; it is considered a lunatic asylum. Merkel may be asked to leave for the leadership of the UN, and then the treaty would be signed. It will shake the world and end any thought of the United States being a global power, which it isn't anymore.""

© Sputnik/ Natalia Seliverstova German Businesses 'Interested' in Lifting Sanctions to Develop Ties With Russia

The source adds, half in zest, ""we think that Brzezinski died under the pressure of the realization that this was coming and that all his hatred of Russia and his life work to destroy them was becoming utterly undone.""

So, in a sense, it's ""welcome to the 1930s all over again and the rise of nationalism in Europe. This time Germany will not make the mistakes of 1914 and 1941 but will stand against their traditional Anglo-Saxon enemies. The United States has truly become today's Carthage and the disorder in Congress reflects the same stupidity of Carthage facing Rome. Legislators undermined their genius Hannibal as they are undermining the greatest president of the United States since Andrew Jackson. As Sophocles wrote in 'Antigone', 'God first makes mad those he wishes to destroy.' This Congress is mad.""

International media lit up in feverish speculation earlier this week after unsubstantiated reports emerged once again that Russia is supposedly arming the Taliban. Moscow struck back at these accusations by decrying them as baseless and part of a US disinformation campaign, which they are, but a few more words need to be offered about this provocative episode in order to place it into its proper context.

The US is aghast that Russia has taken the lead in organizing the Moscow peace process for Afghanistan, which has already seen three meetings hosted in the Russian capital involving all of the war-torn country’s regional stakeholders.

Granted, there’s still a lot of work that needs to be done before this framework can yield anything resembling tangible results, but it’s nevertheless a constructive step in the right direction and presents a multipolar alternative to the previously American-dominated initiatives on this issue.

Importantly, Russia’s policy has recently evolved to the point where Moscow has come to regard the Taliban as an indispensable party to reaching a political solution to the War on Afghanistan, and this is largely due to the group’s effective anti-terrorist fight against Daesh.

© AP Photo/ Allauddin Khan Daesh Declares War on Taliban - Reports

Russia has been warning for the past couple years about the “Islamic State’s” creeping infiltration into the Afghan battlespace, and the organization’s spate of attacks there over the past year have vindicated everything that Moscow was concerned about it and given its peace efforts a renewed impetus.

Correspondingly, Russia has also been engaged in a fast-moving and comprehensive rapprochement with Pakistan during this time as well, motivated by the shared threat that Daesh’s activities in Afghanistan pose to both Great Powers.

Pakistan is more directly affected by this stemming from the fact that it borders Afghanistan and that terrorists there could be exploited by Islamabad’s adversaries to wage the Hybrid War on CPEC, but Russia is also at risk because any large-scale destabilization of its CSTO allies in Central Asia could draw it into a new military conflict and also generate uncontrollable waves of “Weapons of Mass Migration” which could crash into the Russian heartland.

For these reasons, Russia and Pakistan have a common interest in bringing peace to Afghanistan and incorporating the Taliban into the country’s political process, but it’s this combination of factors which has thrown the US’ permanent military, intelligence, and diplomatic bureaucracies (the “deep state”) into such a tizzy. They understand the game-changing implications of the Russian-Pakistan rapprochement and fear that it might grow to the level of a geostrategic partnership, which is why they’re so eager to disrupt it at all costs.

There’s no better way to simultaneously complicate the security situation for both Russia and Pakistan than to destabilize the situation in Afghanistan, though the unintended blowback of this could inevitably be the further strengthening and possible expansion of the unfolding rapprochement between both sides in response.

Regardless of the possibly counterproductive consequences, the US “deep state” seems to have made up its mind to dispatch more soldiers to Afghanistan in order to bring this about, which could have the effect of intensifying the Taliban-Kabul conflict and preventing both sides from pooling their efforts together to defeat Daesh, to say nothing of advancing a political solution to their long-running war.

Trump, on the other hand, while grasping the strategic significance of deploying more boots on the ground in this tri-regional pivot state at the crossroads of West, Central, and South Asia, is also worried about the domestic political repercussions of doing so, especially if this results in more body bags being sent back to the homeland.

Furthermore, Trump distrusts his “deep state” to the point of being suspicious of practically all of his appointees, including his own National Security Advisor General H. R. McMaster according to reports. This senior administration figure had apparently been lobbying the President to authorize more troops to Afghanistan, but Politico writes that this was in vain because a “sh*t show” recently ensued which saw Trump dramatically rebuking McMaster by declining to deploy more soldiers and humiliatingly ordering the General’s proposal back to the drawing board.

It’s not known with any degree of absolute certainty why he made this decision, but it’s likely that the aforementioned domestic political considerations and “deep state” distrust played a guiding role, as well as the influence of his Chief Strategist Steve Bannon.

Reports circulated earlier this month that the former Breitbart executive is urging Trump to “outsource” the war to private military contractors (PMCs, also known as mercenaries) such as those under the control of his friend and infamous Blackwater founder Erik Prince.

The idea behind this proposal is that swapping uniformed US troops with PMCs will allow Trump to disingenuously make the case that he’s drawing down America’s conventional involvement in the War on Afghanistan and therefore win political points at home, all the while silently expanding its informal footprint through more mercenaries, many of whom are former US military personnel anyhow.

It’s also politically convenient for another reason as well – as the war intensifies, more Americans will inevitably be killed, but the public doesn’t react the same way to a mercenary’s death as they do to an official soldier’s, and the former isn’t necessarily a matter of public record, either.

US military casualties – whether uniformed or private – will probably become a more frequent occurrence in Afghanistan if Trump has his way in prying the country’s gargantuan untapped mineral reserves from the Taliban.

The New York Times reported earlier this week about how the President is now interested in the estimated $1 trillion of resources lying under Afghanistan’s soil, a sizeable chunk of which is presently under the Taliban’s control and consists of the rare earth minerals that China presently has a monopoly on.

These metals are indispensable to modern-day civilian electronics such as cell phones and military equipment like precision-guided missiles, so there’s clearly a strategic motivation for the US to dominate the extraction of Afghan minerals in order to either deny this resource to its competitors or control their access to it.

The resultant strategy that’s coming into play is one in which the US wants to push the Taliban out of its resource-rich areas, extract and export the rare earth minerals under the soil there, and ensure sustainable security for this entire operation, with the point of contention within the administration coming down to whether it should be uniformed US soldiers or private mercenaries that fight the Taliban.

The “deep state” wants the Pentagon to be in charge of this because it would guarantee that billions of tax-payer dollars continue pouring into their Afghan slush fund, which is notoriously known to be full of waste and corruption, because the pecuniary advantages to be reaped from PMCs are considerably limited to much fewer individuals such as Erik Prince and Stephen Feinberg (the owner of the DynCorp PMC), both of whom are regarded as Trump’s advisors.

In order to push their case that the military should be in charge of this ultra-profitable operation, the “deep state” concocted the fake news conspiracy theory that “Russia is arming the Taliban” in order to “play the Russia card” in pressuring Trump to side with the Pentagon as opposed to the PMCs.

They thought that they could manipulate the President into doing whatever they wanted on the foreign policy front so long as they found a way to incorporate the ongoing anti-Russian witch hunt into their demands, though it looks like Trump isn’t as doing what they expected (or at least not right away) because his personal cohorts have a financial interest in this enterprise too. No matter what Trump ultimately decides, and whether it’s to go forward with McMaster’s uniformed troop surge, the Bannon-Price-Feinberg PMC proposal, or a combination thereof, the US will do whatever it can to prevent the Moscow peace process from succeeding.

The $1 trillion mineral bonanza that’s made Trump all of a sudden interested in Afghanistan is too big of a potential prize for the billionaire businessman to pass up, and he knows that the US won’t be able to extract its envied mineral resources as long as the Taliban retains control of the territory above them.

Therefore, it’s expected that the US will attempt in one way or another – whether through the Pentagon and/or PMCs – to go on the offensive against the Taliban, possibly by having its soldiers and/or mercenaries play a decisive “Lead From Behind” role in using Kabul’s fighters as cannon fodder to this effect. The anticipated escalation of the War on Afghanistan and the inevitable window of opportunity that Daesh will see in all of this are bound to negatively impact on the security situation in the surrounding states, but it will also make it all the more important that Russia and Pakistan take their strategic cooperation to the next level in formulating a joint response.

Well, at least that appeared to be the case in the film Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon, released in that wonderfully groovy Summer of Love in 1967.

A whimsical and utterly charming international comedy about a space race in 19th century Britain, shot in glorious Eastman color and filmed in Ireland's stunningly picturesque Wicklow Mountains, Rocket to the Moon encapsulated the sunny optimism of the era in which it was made.

""The music is a highlight and it is almost impossible to find, at times, a happier little film than this one is in spots,"" says one reviewer on IMDb.com.

At the time the film (whose American title was Those Fantastic Flying Fools) was released in July 1967, there was of course a real-life ""moon race"" going on between the US and the USSR — and one that didn't involve Tsarist agents, Troy Donahue and Phineas T. Barnum.

The Soviets had launched the first artificial satellite, (Sputnik, of course!) and put the first man (Yuri Gagarin) and the first woman (Valentina Tereshkova) into space. They also put the first animal into orbit too — a little dog named Laika.

Soviet achievements were being praised even by leading British Tory MPs.

""Forty years ago the Soviet Union was a backward country, poor, illiterate, and agricultural. Today she is identified with prodigious feats of science and technology,"" enthused Aubrey Jones in 1961 in the Sunday Times.

But the Americans, beaten in other areas, were determined to get to the moon first. President Kennedy proposed, in May 1961, that ""before this decade is out"" the US would land a man on the moon and return him safely to earth. ""We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard,"" Kennedy said eighteen months later at Rice University.

When Rocket to the Moon was released, we were in fact just two years away — to the very week — from the US achieving its goal — even though JFK sadly wasn't there to see it.

The Cold War had ""moved to the heavens,"" in the words of Jeremy Isaacs and Taylor Downing. But weren't we better off seeing a space race rather than increased hostilities on earth? Back in the 1960s we were all — to paraphrase Oscar Wilde — looking at the stars, and our dreams were very big indeed.

Fifty years ago, it seemed, as in the Victorian era — that all things were possible. A man on the moon. Supersonic passenger planes. The work-life balance sorted. Global equality. The eradication of terrible diseases. A genuine internationalism based on mutual respect between nations and cultures. There were still many problems, but the setbacks the US was experiencing in Vietnam, and the popular opposition to that war the world over were signs that imperialism had hit a brick wall.

Growing detente between east and west, brought about because the US couldn't get its way in south-east Asia, led many to hope that the Cold War would end in a merging of two systems. Western countries were certainly becoming more socialistic — with full employment, generous welfare provision and an extension of public ownership the norm. The working man — and woman — had never had it so good, in east and west. Music and films reflected the ""feel good"" factor of the time. The number one record of fifty years ago was appropriately enough ""All you need is love.""

So where did it all go wrong?

The problem was that those who supported detente in the west were pushed aside by those who wanted to destroy the Soviet Union, and indeed any economic system which put the needs of the majority first. The 1970s were the apogee of progressive politics, with historically low levels of inequality, and historically high levels of social/public ownership, but the decade also witnessed the start of the neocon/neoliberal fight back.

We saw examples of this with the toppling of the democratically elected socialist Salvador Allende in Chile in 1973, and the restructuring of the Chilean economy by ""The Chicago Boys"" — and in the battles inside the Carter administration from 1977-80. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance wanted to strengthen detente, but the aggressive hawk Zbigniew Brzezinski — Carter's National Security adviser, persuaded the president to back Islamist ""rebels"" in Afghanistan in order to ""bleed"" the Soviet Union for ""as much and as long as is possible.""

Things got even worse under Ronald Reagan, who stepped up the program for aiding the ""Mujahideen,"" leading to the birth of al-Qaeda. While in Britain, Margaret Thatcher, a Cold War warrior for the 1%, set about dismantling the equitable post-war economic settlement with glee.

The fall of communism at the very end of the 80s, cheered on even not just by the neo-cons, but by many ""progressives"" too, paved the way for a new, even more aggressive form of neo-liberalism and a series of brutal wars against independent nations by the US and its closest allies.

The results have been truly catastrophic. Today, half the world's wealth is owned by just eight individuals, while the living standards of ordinary people continues to fall.

""At home Euro-American policy elites — the least needy people the world has ever seen — are driving through a hard neo-liberal agenda in order to gnaw away at wages within their own territories."" writes Robert Hunter Wade, professor of political economy.

""Regime-change"" wars — waged for the benefit of the elites — have destroyed whole countries, created a refugee crisis of biblical proportions and helped spread terrorism around the globe.

We don't get films like Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon made any more. We get much darker artistic offerings, reflecting our more fearful, depressed times: The Hunger Games, Game of Thrones, Broadchurch and Nordic Noir films.

But remembering the Swinging Sixties, the race to the moon, and the cheery optimism of those much happier days, shows us it doesn't have to be like this.

Political observer Ilya Kharlamov says the timing of the suspected hack attack could not have been more convenient for Washington's anti-Russia hawks.

Hackers presumed to be working for a foreign government have penetrated the computer networks of at least a dozen nuclear and other energy facilities in the United States, the New York Times and Bloomberg have reported. The targeted plants included the Wolf Creek nuclear facility in Kansas, according to a joint report by the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation obtained by NYT.

The joint DHS and FBI report was unable to confirm whether the cyberattack was an attempt at espionage, or a search for vulnerabilities in the US electrical grid.

Nonetheless, while saying that the investigation was ""still in its early stages,"" two anonymous sources 'familiar with the investigation' told NYT that the hackers' techniques ""mimicked those of the organization known to cybersecurity specialists as 'Energetic Bear,'"" a presumed Russian hacking collective.

Bloomberg picked up and ran with the 'Russians did it' angle, citing three more anonymous sources familiar with the situation who said that Moscow was ""the chief suspect"" in the attack. Former and current officials told the news agency that the Russian trace was ""particularly worrisome"" in light of Russian hackers' extensive experience with taking down electric grids, and their apparent access to ""increasingly advanced tools to disrupt power supplies.""

Representatives from the National Security Council, the Director and National Intelligence and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission declined to comment on the hacking attack. Meanwhile, several private security firms studying the data on the attacks have failed to link the work to a particular country or hacking collective.

Sean McBride, a lead analyst for global cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc. told Bloomberg that for now, his company can't tie the hack to any known group. ""It's not to say it's not related, but we don't have the evidence at this point,"" the expert said.

© AFP 2017/ Emmanuel Dunand New York Times Retracts Rumor on Russia-Gate Following Ridicule

Bloomberg noted that ""it was unclear whether President Trump was planning to address the cyberattacks at his meeting on Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin."" Several US intelligence agencies had earlier alleged that Russia had tried to influence the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election. Moscow has repeatedly denied these claims, pointing to the fact that no evidence of Russian interference has ever been provided.

Commenting on the power plant hack story, Radio Sputnik observer Ilya Kharlamov pointed out that it was extremely convenient that yet another 'Russian hackers' story has come to light, just hours ahead of the much anticipated first meeting between Presidents Putin and Trump. The hack attack, he warned, threatens to disrupt any attempts to get Russian-US relations back on track.

In fact, Kharlamov suggested, the cyberattack story, and the timing of its leak to the press, may very well be a direct provocation by US hawks inclined toward preserving their confrontation with Russia – a kind of unpleasant surprise for the two leaders ahead of their meeting.

""The topic, of course, is the same exhausted topic of the Russian cyber threat, but with a new quality and tone: Namely, this time Moscow is suspected of carrying out hacking attacks on American nuclear power plants. So much was reported via information assets traditionally acting in the role of 'anonymous sources',"" the observer wrote.

""Of course, no evidence to the dumbfounded American and world public has been presented,"" Kharlamov stressed. ""However, who needs evidence when the conversation turns to a 'global villain' such as Russia? Moscow, as we all know, is guilty a priori. One might have a laugh at and forget about this immensely absurd story…But this sort of accusation is more serious even than the insinuations about Russian attempts to influence the US presidential election. This is no longer just a half-baked political story featuring dubious arguments from Washington, but a question of the security of the United States and its citizens – a question of life and death,"" the journalist noted.

Accordingly, Kharlamov warned, such claims may result in serious repercussions, setting the American public against Russia, which is now accused of being a physical danger to the US. ""Against the background of this sort of 'story', the hacking scandals around last year's elections, and of Trump's imaginary ties with Moscow, pale in comparison. Factually, this is the beginning of a new full-scale Cold War, when one party, it is said, poses a mortal threat to the other.""

""It's obvious that this story appeared in a very timely manner – just before the meeting between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump in Hamburg. And this is another link in the chain, meant to block any chance of establishing relations with Moscow,"" the observer added.

Trump, Kharlamov noted, is now surrounded by people with anti-Russian attitudes. In order for dialogue with Moscow to succeed on any level, ""he needs to be a master of the political balancing act. For now, he has not demonstrated such skills. On the contrary, he himself makes every effort to distance himself as much as possible from any suspicions of a positive or even neutral attitude toward Russia.""

Ultimately, the door to improving relations is not fully closed for Moscow and Washington, according to the journalist. Still, the more evidence-free claims the deep state and their mainstream media allies concoct, the more difficult it becomes for any US officials, Trump included, to reach out to Moscow."

Speaking to local media, Zypries said the US could not punish German firms on the mere basis they were doing business with — or in — another country.

While she stressed a trade war between the two Western giants was an unwelcome prospect, she made clear Europe remains ever-ready to take ""retaliatory measures"" in response to US intransigence.

""We consider this as being against international law, plain and simple. The Americans can't punish German companies because they have business interests in another country, but unfortunately that is exactly what they are doing. That means that it is right that the European Commission now considers countermeasures,"" she said.

The latest sanctions bill will fine businesses found to be helping Moscow expand and enhance its energy export pipelines, theoretically leaving European energy firms open to harsh penalties purely for having ties to Russian firms. While President Donald Trump is yet to give his assent, former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci said July 27 Trump is certain to either sign the bill or negotiate an ""even tougher deal"" against Russia.

Of particular concern to Zypries is Nord Stream 2, a pipeline project aimed at pumping Russian natural gas to Europe via the Baltic Sea to landfall in Germany. The project is being spearheaded by Gazprom, and supported by a number of European partners including Germany's Wintershall and Austria's OMV.

As of August 1, Brussels is yet to comment on the sanctions bill, or its bearing on European energy firms, although member state leaders themselves haven't been silent.

If a trade war were to erupt, it would not be without precedent — the ""banana wars"" raged for much of the 1990s. Then, it was the US that bore a grievance, over an EU scheme that gave banana producers from former European colonies in the Caribbean special access to European markets.

Believing the deal broke free trade rules, the US filed a complaint against the EU with the World Trade Organization (WTO) and won in 1997, forcing the EU to alter its rules.

Despite the ruling, the US felt free trade in bananas had not been restored, and imposed retaliatory 100 percent import duties on European products, ranging from Scottish cashmere to French cheese. As a result, Europe's exporters were obliged to pay huge amounts to US customs simply to get their products onto the US mainland, threatening EU exports worth around US$520 million annually, and placed thousands of jobs at risk.

Moreover, almost concurrently, in 1996 the US similarly sued Brussels at the WTO over the latter's ban on hormone-treated beef. Europe upheld the ban, so the WTO authorized the US to impose punitive tariffs equal to the damage suffered because of the hormone ban.

The retaliatory tariffs had a massive impact, causing the value of EU imports affected by the duties to drop from US$130 million in 1997-98 to under US$15 million in 2008.

The dispute persists to this day, with Trump mulling 100 percent tariffs on around 90 European products, particularly agricultural products from France, Germany and Italy. However, US cross hairs are also bizarrely trained on mopeds, chocolate, mustard, paprika, chestnuts and even hair clippers.

A theory has emerged which links the series of killings in Victorian London with the first serial killer to emerge in the United States.

Dr. Henry H. Holmes built a hotel in Chicago in time for the World's Fair, which was held in 1893.

​But the hotel was in fact a labyrinthine torture chamber and the guests would book in, but never leave.

Holmes — who was born as the rather more prosaic Herman Mudgett — confessed to killing 27 people in his ""murder castle"" and was hanged in 1896.

""I was born with the devil in me. I could not help the fact that I was a murderer, no more than the poet can help the inspiration to sing,"" wrote Holmes in his confession.

But a television documentary, broadcast in Britain on August 8, claims Holmes may have claimed more victims in England, before emigrating to the United States.

The American Ripper, on the History Channel, claims there are similarities between the two serial killers.

Jack The Ripper attacked his early victims — who were prostitutes — in the street, before mutilating them. But his later victims were lured back to a boarding house where he had more time to carry out his horrific mutilations.

Holmes went further, skinning and dissected his victims, before dissolving their bodies in acid.

The makers of the documentary argue that the killings in Chicago showed a maturing serial killer who had perfected his grisly techniques.

The Ripper is also known to have had skills as either a surgeon or a butcher, and they point out that Holmes was a chemist who had a medical degree from the University of Michigan.

The Ripper's victims were all killed in the Whitechapel district of east London in 1888, and the killer vanished without being caught by the police.

But the documentary makers surmised that he traveled to the US and continued his crimes in 1891.

Jeff Mudgett has been trying for years to convince the world his great-great-great-grandfather was Jack The Ripper.

He believes Scotland Yard detectives traveled to the US to investigate his ancestor.

​""There were many rumors at the time that Jack the Ripper was an American doctor… I think he committed his crimes, booked a trip home and they followed him back here. I don't know why they stopped, it could have been money,"" said Mr. Mudgett.

Mr. Mudgett says handwriting experts have confirmed that letters written by Holmes bear similarities to missives which were sent in 1888 from someone who claimed to be Jack the Ripper.

Over the years dozens of names have been suggested for the identity of Jack The Ripper, whose crimes were so notorious that in the 1970s Peter Sutcliffe, an unrelated serial killer who attacked 12 prostitutes with a hammer, was dubbed The Yorkshire Ripper.

And last year a serial killer in Inner Mongolia was dubbed the Chinese Jack The Ripper.

Among those who have put in the frame include the 19th century artist Walter Sickert, who was accused by US crime novelist Patricia Cornwell, and even author Lewis Carroll.

Several suspects have a royal connection. They include Queen Victoria's grandson, the Duke of Clarence, the royal physician Sir William Withey Gull, and Queen Victoria's surgeon, Sir John Williams, who had a practise in Whitechapel at the time.

More likely candidates for the crime are cotton merchant James Maybrick, Dorset lawyer Montague Druitt and a Polish immigrant, Seweryn Klosowski, who poisoned three of his wives and was hanged in 1903.

Another Pole, Aaron Kosminski, was suspected. He died in a lunatic asylum.

Two other suspects were Dr. Thomas Neill Cream, who was hanged for poisoning four London prostitutes with strychnine, and even Lord Randolph Churchill, the father of wartime prime minister Winston Churchill.

One theory even claimed the Ripper could have been a woman."

The American Ripper, on the History Channel, claims there are similarities between the two serial killers.

Jack The Ripper attacked his early victims — who were prostitutes — in the street, before mutilating them. But his later victims were lured back to a boarding house where he had more time to carry out his horrific mutilations.

Holmes went further, skinning and dissected his victims, before dissolving their bodies in acid.

The makers of the documentary argue that the killings in Chicago showed a maturing serial killer who had perfected his grisly techniques.

The Ripper is also known to have had skills as either a surgeon or a butcher, and they point out that Holmes was a chemist who had a medical degree from the University of Michigan.

The Ripper's victims were all killed in the Whitechapel district of east London in 1888, and the killer vanished without being caught by the police.

But the documentary makers surmised that he traveled to the US and continued his crimes in 1891.

Jeff Mudgett has been trying for years to convince the world his great-great-great-grandfather was Jack The Ripper.

He believes Scotland Yard detectives traveled to the US to investigate his ancestor.

​""There were many rumors at the time that Jack the Ripper was an American doctor… I think he committed his crimes, booked a trip home and they followed him back here. I don't know why they stopped, it could have been money,"" said Mr. Mudgett.

Mr. Mudgett says handwriting experts have confirmed that letters written by Holmes bear similarities to missives which were sent in 1888 from someone who claimed to be Jack the Ripper.

Over the years dozens of names have been suggested for the identity of Jack The Ripper, whose crimes were so notorious that in the 1970s Peter Sutcliffe, an unrelated serial killer who attacked 12 prostitutes with a hammer, was dubbed The Yorkshire Ripper.

And last year a serial killer in Inner Mongolia was dubbed the Chinese Jack The Ripper.

Among those who have put in the frame include the 19th century artist Walter Sickert, who was accused by US crime novelist Patricia Cornwell, and even author Lewis Carroll.

Several suspects have a royal connection. They include Queen Victoria's grandson, the Duke of Clarence, the royal physician Sir William Withey Gull, and Queen Victoria's surgeon, Sir John Williams, who had a practise in Whitechapel at the time.

More likely candidates for the crime are cotton merchant James Maybrick, Dorset lawyer Montague Druitt and a Polish immigrant, Seweryn Klosowski, who poisoned three of his wives and was hanged in 1903.

Another Pole, Aaron Kosminski, was suspected. He died in a lunatic asylum.

Two other suspects were Dr. Thomas Neill Cream, who was hanged for poisoning four London prostitutes with strychnine, and even Lord Randolph Churchill, the father of wartime prime minister Winston Churchill.

One theory even claimed the Ripper could have been a woman."

Sino-US trade will continue to boom in the second half of this year, ""with China's imports from the US growing faster than its exports"". Therefore, the US trade deficit with China will decline, Wei Jianguo told China Daily in an interview.

Part of the reason why US would surpass the EU, which was China's top trading partner almost for the past decade, Wei said, lies in the ever-strengthening Sino-US economic and trade ties.

In April, China and the US agreed to initiate a cooperation plan to address trade imbalance. Under the plan, China will resume US beef imports, and allow rice imports for the first time.

Between January and June, Sino-US trade amount reached 1.85 trillion yuan ($275 billion), up 21.3 percent from last year, according to the General Administration of Customs. The growth rate is higher than that between China and the European Union members, which stood at 17.4 percent in the same period. Sino-EU trade was 1.97 trillion yuan.

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — Six days after the House approved an anti-Russian sanctions package on July 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on Sunday that the diplomatic presence of the United States in Russia would be cut by 755 people to 455, the same number of diplomatic personnel that Russia currently has in the US.

On Monday, Vice President Mike Pence said Trump will soon sign into law the new legislation that enhances US sanctions against Russia. It passed by overwhelming majorities of 419 to 3 in the House of Representatives and by 98 to two in the Senate.

""It should not come as a surprise that Putin decided to retaliate in kind,"" Schirach, president of the Global Policy Institute and professor of international affairs at BAU International University in Washington, said. ""Now, after Congress, by a huge margin in both houses, passed this law containing sanctions, Putin decided to get even, as he realized that these are ‘veto proof’ majorities. In other words, even if he wanted to, President Trump could not block this legislation.""

These measures revealed Washington and Moscow were already caught in a no-win cycle of escalating retaliatory measures on both sides.

""Will this huge cut affect Washington's ability to engage Russia in a meaningful way? Probably yes, even though it is not clear at this time which sectors of the bilateral relationship will be mostly affected by these significant cuts,"" he concluded.

Any hopes of improving US ties with Russia would have to wait until Trump was free of the probe by former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Robert Mueller into the president’s alleged collusion with Moscow during the 2016 presidential election campaign, Schirach acknowledged.

Obdulia Sanchez, who livestreamed the incident on Instagram, showing her 14-year-old sister’s body after it had been ejected from the vehicle, will have her bail remain at $560,000.

According to Merced County Superior Court Judge David Moranda, Sanchez had a previous juvenile reckless driving case, and his decision was made on recommendations from probation officers.

Ramnik Samrao, Sanchez’s defense attorney, asked that the bail be lowered so that his client could go free pending trial, saying that Sanchez doesn’t have access to the kind of funds that would allow her to post bail.

""That’s just absurd to believe that she would be able to do that, I think this bail is excessive for her, and it should have been reduced,"" Samrao said outside the courtroom, the Associated Press reported.

He added, ""There is the eighth amendment to the constitution that says no excessive bail shall be required. I think this bail is excessive for her.""

Samrao also refuted claims that his client did not attempt to assist her sister, saying the video does not show Obdulia calling for help immediately after the crash.

The video shows the Stockton, California woman dancing to music in her car and taking her hands from the steering wheel, and will serve as a key piece of evidence according to prosecutors.

A week ago Sanchez was driving near Fresno when her car swerved and turned over in a field, ejecting and killing her 14-year-old sister, Jacqueline Sanchez. Obdulia continued filming after the crash, showing her sister’s body and saying, ""I killed my f****** sister. I know I am going to jail for life I understand that… this is the last thing I wanted to happen alright… I love you, RIP sweetie…If you don’t survive I am so sorry.""

According to authorities Obdulia had to be strapped to a gurney after kicking a paramedic in the face, yelling racial slurs and spitting on first responders. Police reports say that she refused and alcohol test, smelled strongly of alcohol, and medical records showed that she was legally drunk at the time of the incident.

Samrao argues that Sanchez’s behavior was due to not wanting to leave her sister’s side.

If convicted on six felony counts including drunken driving resulting in injuries and gross vehicular manslaughter, Sanchez could face 13 years in prison. She has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Nicandro Sanchez, father of the two girls, spoke in court with the help of a Spanish translator, saying that he feels like he’s lost both of his daughters, and that he had no ill will towards Obdulia for the crash.

""We’re asking that she be returned home or to the home where she was being taken care of,"" he said.

Harold Nutt, Merced County Chief Deputy District Attorney called Obdulia’s behavior ""disturbing and shocking,” calling her a “danger to society,” and arguing that “she doesn’t have a stable home environment or a stable place to go to."""

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — ""Are you concerned about the embassy being so close to you, given current events? I've heard that some people that some people are concerned about the cameras and that the embassy may be spying on you. Are many people concerned about it?"" the email, received by the residents, said on Monday.

The reporter explained in the email that she was currently working on an article about Glover Park's relationship with the Russian Embassy.

""Is it a frequent topic of conversation? Do you think that having the Embassy in your neighborhood has had much of an impact in the neighborhood? Why or why not?,"" the email added.

One Glover Park resident told Sputnik on Monday that she had never been concerned about the embassy until receiving the email from the Examiner, stressing that now she ""might worry that there could be violence by Americans against that building and apartment buildings in the neighborhood where many Russian embassy workers live.""

""The press must avoid stirring people up,"" she emphasized.

Sputnik has reached out to the Washington Examiner and is awaiting its response.

The story comes amid Moscow’s decision to cut the US diplomatic presence in Russia.

On Friday, the Russian Foreign Ministry urged the United States to bring the number of diplomats and technical staff of diplomatic missions in Russia in line with the number of Russian diplomatic representatives in the United States before September 1.

Consequently, the total number of personnel employed in US diplomatic and consular offices in Russia will be reduced to 455 people. On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the diplomatic presence of the United States in Russia would be cut by 755 employees.

Russia's move came as a response to a series of measures implemented by the United States.

The White House is looking into options to respond to Moscow’s decision, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said during a press briefing on Monday."

Authorities made their way to the replica’s display site after an alarm went off before midnight Friday at the Armstrong Air and Space Museum in Wapakoneta, Ohio, the hometown of Neil Armstrong, who in 1969 became the first human to set foot on the surface of the moon.

Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, another astronaut aboard the Apollo 11, were presented with the module by French jeweler Cartier shortly after their return to Earth after the mission was complete.

Retired NASA agent Joseph Gutheinz Jr. pointed out that the burglars bypassed a moon rock from the mission that could’ve sold to a collector for millions of dollars. ""Either they didn't have easy access to the moon rock, or they weren't into collectibles,"" he told the Associated Press, reasoning that ""they were into turning a quick buck.""

The museum closed for several hours on Saturday and posted a statement on Facebook, saying, ""The truth is that you can't steal from a museum. Museum's don't ‘own’ artifacts. We are simply vessels of the public trust.""

""Museums care for and exhibit items on behalf of you, the public. Theft from a museum is a theft from all of us. Three hundred people driving from across the country were robbed of their opportunity to experience the museum today. For every day that an item is missing, we are all robbed of an opportunity to enjoy it and our history.""

Gutheinz said it would be a ""damn shame"" if the replica was melted down, and it would also make finding the thieves very difficult.

Another Apollo 11 artifact has been in the news lately, as a clerical error led to a NASA bag containing moon dust collected during the mission winding up in the hands of a Chicago area woman, who had to sue to get it back from the space agency after she sent it to be authenticated.

A judge ruled that although the bag should’ve never been placed at auction, NASA had no right to reverse the sale, and the bag was returned to the woman, who sold it at a Sotheby’s auction in New York for $1.8 million

Authorities aren’t able to pinpoint a value for the gold model. The theft is being investigated by local police with assistance from the Ohio Bureau of Investigation."

On Sunday, the opposition organized the so-called popular referendum, in which over 98 percent of 7.2 million voters opposed Maduro’s decision to call the Constituent Assembly. The country’s government believes that results of the referendum do not have legal force as only the electoral authorities have the right to hold such events.

""We are seeing a classic Maidan in Venezuela in the same pattern that was conducted by the US in Kiev in 2014,"" Pshenichnikov said in a video posted on the RISI website.

The expert stressed that the United States is the main cause of unrest in Venezuela. ""Due to certain circumstances, the current parliament — the opposition, is completely opposed to Maduro and its main goal is to remove him from power,"" Pshenichnikov said.

By removing President Nicolas Maduro from power the United States wants to regain its positions in oil-rich Venezuela.

“This is the root of what is happening and this is the way to consider all the events that are taking place in Venezuela,” he said.

Pshenichnikov noted that since the beginning of April there have been mass protests in the country after the decision of the Supreme Court to severely restrict the power of the National Assembly.

""Had Maduro tried to ban the holding of a referendum, the situation could have gone completely out of control,"" the expert said.

However, he noted that only the opposition forces participated in the voting.

""We must understand that Venezuela is sliding slowly, but confidently to the brink of a civil war,"" Pshenichnikov warned.

Venezuela has been experiencing a period of political instability amid the drastic economic situation in the country. The most recent protests erupted in April after the country's Supreme Court tried to take over legislative powers from the opposition-controlled National Assembly.

The top court reversed the ruling but the step did not stop mass demonstrations.

In May, Maduro announced his decision to call the National Constituent Assembly, which was regarded by the opposition as an attempted coup and resulted in further escalation of tensions that resulted in the deaths of over 90 people.

Venezuela will hold voting on July 30 to elect the Constitutional Assembly, set to rewrite the constitution as a way out of the political turmoil, which started in January 2016, when a new legislature was elected and relations between Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the parliament became strained."

MEXICO CITY (Sputnik)According to the National Electoral Council, the voter turnout was just over 41.5 percent. However, after publishing photos of empty polling stations throughout the day, the country's opposition is now disputing the figure. Maduro's opponents suggest that only about 10 percent of voters came out to cast their ballots.

Months of protests that began in April have left more than 100 people dead. According to the country's Public Prosecutor's office, the investigation is underway into the deaths of 10 people during the Sunday rallies. And while protest rallies had been officially prohibited before the vote, this did not stop the demonstrators.

Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro convened the Constituent Assembly to restore peace in a beleaguered country, but the opposition fears that a new legislative body would only serve to solidify the current government's hold onto power.

The opposition staged strikes on Wednesday and Thursday. The day of the vote itself was marred by violent clashes between protesters and the police. A grenade explosion at a polling station in the city of Valle De La Pascua left six people injured.

The 545-member Constituent Assembly will be able to start working as soon as on Wednesday. Maduro said on Sunday that one of the first things that had to be done would be reforming the country's public prosecutor's office. Venezuelan Attorney General Luisa Ortega Diaz emerged as a critic of the government. In the run-up to the election, Ortega Diaz said that the administration was violating the constitution, and that the Sunday vote would present a choice between continued existence or the establishment of a totalitarian system. Ortega Diaz herself is currently under an administrative investigation for abusing her position as attorney general.

Henrique Capriles Radonski, the governor of the state of Miranda and a senior opposition leader, reportedly said on Sunday the vote was ""fraudulent."" The Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD) opposition coalition announced new protests earlier in the day on Twitter, while the Peruvian Foreign Ministry said it would call an emergency meeting of American nations, expected to be held on August 8.

Caracas said in April it would be withdrawing from the Organization of American States. Its membership of a sub-regional Mercosur trade bloc has been suspended since December, and the member states are reportedly considering Venezuela's expulsion. A number of countries in the region have sharply criticized Caracas, starting from April, when the Venezuela's top court made a decision to curb the powers of the National Assembly, which triggered a wave of protests that did not subside even as the decision was later reversed.

The United States has promised to impose economic sanctions on Venezuela if it proceeded with the Constitutional Assembly. The sanctions might reportedly target the oil sector, which has the potential to hurt an already struggling economy. The Venezuelan government largely relied on revenues from oil, its major export, to fund social programs. However, the plunging oil prices rattled the country's economy, which reportedly led to food and medicine shortages.

Maduro immediately dismissed the US warning of sanctions and emphatically reinstated his position at a rally on Sunday, saying that the Venezuelan government was interested in what its people had to say rather than the opinion of US President Donald Trump."

MEXICO CITY (Sputnik) — On Sunday, Venezuela is holding election of the members of the Constituent Assembly, a new legislative body with the power to amend the constitution.

""The turnout amounts to 9 percent with 25 percent of these votes belonging to civil servants, they are not valid,"" Solorzano said on Sunday.

There is no official data about the turnout. Earlier on Sunday, one of the opposition leaders, Governor of of the Venezuelan state of Miranda, Henrique Capriles Radonski wrote on his Twitter page that the turnout would not reach 15 percent.

Venezuelan authorities have already decided to extend the work of polling stations by an hour so that more people could take part in the election.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced his decision to convene the Constituent Assembly in early May, claiming it would bring peace to the South American country hit by months of violent protests. However, the opposition fear that the Constituent Assembly would allow Maduro to bypass the opposition-controlled parliament."

Introduced on Thursday by Texas Republican Representative Will Hurd, whose district includes over 800 miles of the US-Mexico border, the Secure Miles with All Resources and Technology, or SMARTAct, is co-sponsored by representatives from border states California, New Mexico and Texas, as well as Pennsylvania.

The bill would direct the Department of Homeland Security to build a network of sensors, drones and fiber optics to monitor the border and protect the country from unwanted immigrants and contraband. Hurd said in a statement that the smart wall could be “fully operational within a year,” according to Nextgov, and would improve border protections and save taxpayers money.

“Violent drug cartels are using more modern technology to breach our border than what we are using to secure it,” Hurd explained.

On the campaign trail ahead of the 2016 presidential election, Trump bluntly called Mexican immigrants “rapists” and claimed that they brought drugs and crime across the border. The statements outraged many in the US. He insisted he would stem the flow of undocumented immigrants by building a wall along the US-Mexican border and force the Mexican government to pay the construction expenses. Mexico has denied it will do so.

“[Rather] than building walls to meet campaign promises, [the SMARTAct] takes a measured approach by directing DHS, in conjunction with state and local agencies” to determine what technologies could better be used to secure the border, according to Texas Democrat Henry Cuellar, one of the bill’s co-sponsors.

“A giant wall is nothing more than a 14th Century solution to a 21st Century problem,” he added.

The US Border Patrol’s acting Chief Scott Luck testified last week at a House of Representatives subcommittee hearing that a combination of technology, physical barriers and trained professionals would be needed to secure the US border with Mexico.

Ideally, a border control system would be put in place whereby information could be “shared immediately to all components and agents and officers who need it,” Luck said.

As far as technology goes, Hurd has reportedly been tapping the expertise of Anduril Industries, a Silicon Valley defense tech firm founded by virtual reality entrepreneur Palmer Luckey, who also founded Oculus VR, CNN reported. The proposal estimates the smart wall will cost — at most — $500,000 per mile, considerably less than the $24.5 million per mile requested by the government for border security for fiscal year 2018."

Uber and Lyft changed the way consumers travel in the cities. Airbinb did the same for property rentals. Online talent marketplaces, like Upwork and OnForce, supply new opportunities for those who offer and seek jobs. These services are all part of an on-demand economy, where providers and freelancers are connected with customers with the help of the Internet and special applications.

Two years ago software development company Intuit issued a report saying that by 2020 the number of US employees working as providers in the on-demand economy will double from 3.2 to 7.6 billion.

However, as the number of ongoing controversies in on-demand economy companies is quite high, it seems that relations between ""app workers"" and their employers need improvements.

""Non-standard forms of employment are fourfold: part-time work, temporary work, temporary agency work, that is if a third party involved, and then there is disguised employment, or disguised self-employment. What the report shows, based on 20 years of evidence, is that non-standard forms of employment are on the rise across the globe,"" International Labour Organization deputy director Deborah Greenfield said.

While car manufacturing jobs were big in the 1950s, by the turn of the century humans have been replaced by robots, leaving thousands of people jobless. So, according to many experts, flexibility, self-improvement and constant learning are becoming key abilities for those who would like to make a successful career in the 21st century.

In one of the scenes in the 1967 Hollywood classic movie “The Graduate”, Dustin Hoffman’s character Ben is getting career advice from an older man — Mr. McGuire. The man says just one word – “plastics,” adding that there is a great future in plastics.

Indeed, plastics were huge in the subsequent decades, especially during the 1970’s and 1980’s industrial era, so Ben would have probably succeeded if he listened to Mr.McGuire’s advice. But what is the new “big thing” now when it comes to investment opportunities and jobs skills, which will be in high demand? We asked Denis Cherkasov, who is CEO at SBVC Asset Management, part of Sberbank Group:

""Certain basic skills will be required in foreseeable future, for me – I think these are mathematics and music. So knowing music and knowing mathematics will keep your children employed in the next century. That would also be my advice to young children, who are now stepping into the world,"" Cherkasov said.

Cherkasov, who’s worked in a number of Russian and foreign investment firms, says that job market trends are quite volatile. What’s in demand now may very well lose value in the future.

""Now everyone is talking about robotics and artificial intelligence; the ‘Internet of things’. Some time ago there were other technologies – crowdfunding, new fintech technologies. Earlier there were new technologies in clearing and banking and finance. So, what it is necessary to learn – is to learn how to learn, how to stay constantly on edge, to educate and upgrade yourself and to have a flexible mind,"" Cherkasov pointed out.

So, it’s likely that many fields of study, including robotics, may look completely different within coming years, and some knowledge will become outdated in as little as few months.

""We live in a world where everybody’s knowledge – my knowledge – becomes obsolete within 6 months. We step into a world where continuous learning and the improvement of skills becomes absolutely crucial not only to move forward, but just to remain on the edge, and keep your position, so to say,"" Cherkasov concluded.

It’s possible that in a changing digital world, you won’t be doing the same thing for decades, and going in a new direction may require additional professional education. In that case, computers, which may have been the reason why you quit, may actually help you to acquire a new profession with the help of AI-enabled custom courses and e-learning programs.

Computers and the Internet already play an important role in most industries – from medicine to agriculture, and from the legal world to manufacturing. However, it’s expected that thanks to artificial intelligence, computers will become even more powerful in the coming years, changing the very way people learn their professional skills.

In 2016 a US-based publisher of business forecasts, Kiplinger, compiled a list of the 10 best jobs of the future, putting five health care industry jobs at the top of the list. Occupations like nurse practitioner, medical sonographer and dental hygienist were followed by a number of computer industry jobs.

The first five professions definitely require a specialized medical education, but also – some degree of computer skills, since most hospitals are equipped with tons of computer equipment. However, it appears that becoming more computer-literate is not just a problem facing younger employees. Seasoned professionals also need to adapt, and not only in the medical field; consulting firms now require tech-savvy as well.

Ian Colebourne, Managing Partner of Deloitte CIS, told Sputnik that besides having traditional finance and legal educations, the new generation of employees is more tech-savvy: ""I think the new generation is coming through already, if you're looking in terms of educational experience, they're so much more literate in terms of the power of technology, and the Internet, and coding, and all of these other areas. And that’s where I think that we see a big shift in terms of our own workforce.""

Deloitte CIS is quite serious about harnessing the technologies of the future, including those which will change the way people learn.

In June, the company announced a joint project with Genome Ventures – a Moscow-based company, which specializes in ed tech and human capital development. The partners place big bets on artificial intelligence and its applications in the private and public sectors.

""We are exploring how together with Genome Ventures we can develop the very-very high capabilities around artificial intelligence. Not only in the sense of its impact on the business, but also in terms of that impact for society, so that it creates opportunities for people not only to develop their skills, but also how we need to understand how we need to adjust the education platforms to equip our young people to be able to succeed and thrive in what will be a digital world,"" Colebourne concluded.

There are several key advantages of AI in learning. The technology allows educators to create adaptable ""tailored"" material, which will help particular individuals understand the material better. Besides, artificial intelligence is good at finding remote assistance for pupils, with crowd-sourced tutoring becoming more and more popular. And above all, AI promises to become a good companion for those who embrace lifelong learning, which is becoming important in the digital world.

Artificial intelligence, big data and computers are quickly changing the global job market. Many jobs may cease to exist within the next decade, as humans are replaced by robots and software. So finding your way in a world of “outdated” and totally new careers is not an easy task.

The job market as we know it may change dramatically within the next few years. According to Staff.com co-founder Rob Rawson Several, some positions once considered the mainstays of banking and finance, including bookkeepers and accountants are likely to be replaced by AI by 2028. Such predictions may give food for thought to those who picked finance as their college major. In a world where AI and neural networks are becoming increasingly successful in competing with humans, it’s hard for young people to pick a future job which will remain relevant by the time they graduate from college.

Even for successful entrepreneurs like the legendary investor Jim Rogers, it’s hard to make exact predictions when it comes to the job market. Rogers, who is Chairman of Beeland Interests Inc., started his career on Wall Street in the 1960’s. However, unlike many of his colleagues, who preferred to stay in the office, Rogers decided to travel around the world. In the 1990’s he visited more than 100 countries, riding a motorcycle and later — driving a custom-built Mercedes. When asked about career choices, Rogers told Radio Sputnik listeners to trust their gut feeling.

“People have to figure out their own passions. And then – do it! Don’t listen to me, don’t listen to your parents, don’t listen to your professors, and don’t listen to your friends. Figure out what you really love and do it. And if people laugh at you – you’re really doing the right thing. You’re really on the right track”

The author of “Adventure Capitalist” and “Investment Biker” decided to leave New York City in 2007 and moved his assets to Singapore, saying that it was the right time to invest in Asian markets. He’s still firm in that belief. The famous investor also says that the revolutionary “next big thing” may very well be in the making right now, and in the coming years technology and the Internet will play a key role.

I’m sure there are now 18-year-old kids in the garage somewhere, coming up with something totally new that’s going to change the whole world – it frequently happens that way. Maybe my children will find the profession of the future. But it certainly has to do with the Internet; it certainly has to do with technology.

According to Payscale.com, computer science graduates are currently in high demand, with annual salaries of $123,000 and up. So, if you’re looking for a career path which is likely to remain relevant in the coming years, hi-tech and internet-related businesses may very well be the right choice for you.

People have been using different authentication methods to gain access to different systems, including online ones, for decades. However, thanks to a new technology there will be no need to use keycards or your body parts, let alone memorize passwords to gain access to your devices, or to online accounts.

Ever wondered what it would be like to protect your electronic devices or online accounts with something other than passwords? There are dozens of other proven authentication technologies out there, such as near-field communication (or NFC) tokens, USB keys, as well as biometric methods.

In the 1983 James Bond movie “Never Say Never Again,” a US Airforce pilot, Jack Petachi, who is also the operative of the criminal organization called Spectre, undergoes an eye operation to make it match the retinal pattern of the US president. Spectre wants Petachi to cheat the retinal scan system and gain access to nuclear warheads to extort billions of dollars from NATO governments.

Even though stealing and recreating someone’s retinal pattern seems impossible to do even using today’s advanced technology, the portrayal of the retinal authentication technique in the movie is quite accurate. US government agencies have been using the method since the 1970s. Even though the technology has its own flaws, including the high price of hardware, it’s 200,000 times more accurate than fingerprint identification.

However, neither retinal scans nor the more advanced iris scan technology, which is good for the Pentagon or NASA, can be used by the average consumer who wants protection and security online at a reasonable price. The cost of hardware and a subscription for such technologies is too high and the whole concept is inconvenient for daily home use.

Nowadays, thanks to AI and other advanced technologies, people’s typing patterns and habits can be used to identify them. Besides the number of words per minute, there are other unique characteristics at play, such as “hold-time” for each key, right-handed, or left-handed approach and “rapid-fire sequences,” in when the user types common letter combinations, such as “the”, or “ing”. So, in keystroke dynamics, it doesn’t matter which password you typed – it’s how you typed it.

Researchers say that the beauty of the method is not only in its use for initial authentication. It can be used continuously. So even if someone was able to impersonate the user during an email login sequence, the system can identify and block the bad guy later, if he tries to compose a new message, and his keystroke dynamics will not match those of the account owner.

So, with the growing use of AI and machine learning, we may very well see the rise of keystroke dynamics and other advanced authentication methods, which minimize the possibility of identity theft and help users stay safe online.

People have been using different authentication methods to gain access to different systems, including online ones, for decades. However, thanks to a new technology there will be no need to use keycards or your body parts, let alone memorize passwords to gain access to your devices, or to online accounts.

Ever wondered what it would be like to protect your electronic devices or online accounts with something other than passwords? There are dozens of other proven authentication technologies out there, such as near-field communication (or NFC) tokens, USB keys, as well as biometric methods.

In the 1983 James Bond movie “Never Say Never Again,” a US Airforce pilot, Jack Petachi, who is also the operative of the criminal organization called Spectre, undergoes an eye operation to make it match the retinal pattern of the US president. Spectre wants Petachi to cheat the retinal scan system and gain access to nuclear warheads to extort billions of dollars from NATO governments.

Even though stealing and recreating someone’s retinal pattern seems impossible to do even using today’s advanced technology, the portrayal of the retinal authentication technique in the movie is quite accurate. US government agencies have been using the method since the 1970s. Even though the technology has its own flaws, including the high price of hardware, it’s 200,000 times more accurate than fingerprint identification.

However, neither retinal scans nor the more advanced iris scan technology, which is good for the Pentagon or NASA, can be used by the average consumer who wants protection and security online at a reasonable price. The cost of hardware and a subscription for such technologies is too high and the whole concept is inconvenient for daily home use.

Last year, antivirus provider Kaspersky Lab announced that some 323,000 new samples of malware are discovered each day. The Internet is becoming a jungle, and even with proper protection measures being taken, it’s very hard for the average user to stay safe online.

In the early days of computing, there were only a few viruses, and not all of them were malware since some were created by programmers for fun or educational purposes. However, by 2011 computer security firm Kaspersky Lab was discovering 70,000 new malicious files daily. In the next six years, that number increased by almost five-fold. Kaspersky says cyber criminals turned to mass production of viruses, so the antivirus giant had to employ a new kind of technology based on machine learning to improve detection process. Hacking software is being made on such a massive scale that it's becoming increasingly harder for antivirus manufacturers to keep up.

New exploits, which use newly-found ""0-day vulnerabilities"" (and thus stay undetectable for antiviruses and firewalls for a while), create so much chaos that critics claim antivirus software is becoming obsolete. But Steven Coty – Chief Security Evangelist of cloud security firm Alert Logic thinks otherwise. Here's a part of his interview on the YouTube channel SingleHop:

Antivirus is key. Regardless of what some people say – it's not dead. And antivirus software still has a place in the security in-depth strategy. We deployed a honeypot late last year and it's been running for well over a year now. We've been collecting a lot of malware samples from different actors around the world. And we've run this through an open-source tool called VirusTotal, where you can basically upload a piece of malware and it will run that malware across fifty of the top antivirus vendors in the world. And we found that 14% of the malware that we've run through there came undetectable, which means 0 of the 55 antivirus vendors picked it up. But they did catch 86%, so antivirus software still has a place in your security in-depth strategy.

However, using antivirus software is not a sure-fire cure for malware epidemic. Researchers say that there are a number of other things that users have to do to stay safe online.

First of all, you have to follow the news and know the scams. The recent WannaCry ransomware epidemic could have been stopped much quicker if thousands of Windows users protected themselves by reading security advisory and patching their systems on time.

Secondly, it's very important to use unique strong passwords for different websites. Passwords like ""12345,"" and ""abc123"" just don’t work anymore. Change your passwords regularly and use two-factor authentication when possible.

Thirdly, think carefully before clicking on links, especially those in emails from unfamiliar senders. Phishing scams are becoming increasingly popular and bad guys do a lot of research to tailor individual messages to their victims.

Besides that, there are dozens of other tips that will keep you safe, like installing security updates on time, using a firewall and improving your online shopping habits.

And, of course, all of that applies not only to your laptop and desktop computers but also to handheld devices, such as tablets or smartphones.

In April of 2017, hacktivist group Shadow Brokers posted several archive files on the popular blogging platform Medium. According to posters, the files contained utilities that belonged to Equation – a hackers group which allegedly works for the National Security Agency.

At first Shadow Brokers put the archives up for auction, but in the end the toolbox did not go to the highest bidder. For some reason the group posted passwords to the archives, releasing the genie out of the bottle.

""Beasts"" with names like ODDJOB, FUZZBUNCH, ETERNALBLUE and DOUBLEPULSAR were downloaded by thousands of Internet users from all over the world. With these tools even inexperienced programmers were able to gain access to various PCs, including those that use Linux and Solaris operating systems.

Here is Watchguard CTO Corey Nachreiner talking about the leaked scripts on YouTube.

The researchers mentioned there were 12 significant vulnerabilities in various versions of Windows, including what they said were up-to-date versions of Windows that could allow bad guys to remotely exploit Windows computers over the network. SMB vulnerabilities are a very big deal. Threats like Configure have used major SMB vulnerabilities in order to spread automatically.

The appearance of the alleged ""Big Brothers toolbox"" out in the open led to heated debates about the US government's online spying ops, and about the NSA's ability to defend itself and eventually find the source of Shadow Brokers leaks. Some NSA critics, like the organization's former contractor Edward Snowden, said that the source should be easily identifiable.

According to researchers, malware called ""WCry"" or ""WannaCry"" use two utilities leaked by Shadow Brokers – ETERNALBLUE and DOUBLEPULSAR. The spread of WCry was stopped rather quickly by Microsoft and other software manufacturers taking action and warning users to install updates and patches.

The term “hacker” was coined by members of a small tight-knit student community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But the word’s meaning has changed drastically since it first appeared in the 1960s.

They are sometimes more famous than movie stars and more notorious than ordinary criminals. The media runs stories about hackers every day, with reports about security breaches, virus attacks and email leaks making the headlines. The word “hackers” is often used to describe highly skilled computer experts, capable of overcoming problems with the use of technical knowledge. However, that is not exactly what the “original hackers” meant.

Here is MIT alumni Richard Stallman talking about the origins of hacking.

“What we mean and meant by hacker is enjoying playful cleverness. And this doesn’t just mean with computers. If you like playful cleverness, you’ll find ways to be playfully clever in whatever medium happens to come to hand.”

Here is a brief showcase of “playful cleverness” tricks, also known as “MIT hacks”- practical jokes and pranks, which became part of campus history. In 1963 MIT pranksters hacked telephone switchboards to make free calls. On several occasions they placed heavy objects, such as a glass cow, a frame of a fire truck and a campus police cruiser on top of the MIT Dome. In 1991 they connected a fire hydrant to a drinking fountain to illustrate their saying that ""Getting an Education from MIT is like taking a drink from a Fire Hose"".

In the 1980s many programmers tried to separate hacker culture from criminal activities, such as break-ins by using alternative terms and definitions, such as “cracking “, ”black hat”, “white hat” and “grey hat”, which were meant to describe the legality of particular actions.

However, most of the time, when journalists use the term “hacking” they only mean cyber crime. Even though most break-ins are criminal in nature, the motives behind break-ins, email leaks and virus attacks may vary. Hacktivist networks, such as “Anonymous” often act against government and corporate structures. They oppose internet censorship and control. Other hackers are “guns for hire”, who use Deep Web message board to advertise their services – from breaking into someone’s Facebook profile, to stealing financial records and classified government data. “White hat” hackers are security experts who scan systems for security flaws and notify software developers so that these vulnerabilities can be patched. And, of course, there are hacking artists, who use technology as artistic medium. They work with graphics, sculpture, audio and video, as well as computer hardware.

In today’s world, where technology is making giant leaps, new meanings and overtones for the word “hacking” appear almost every year. So, perhaps, in the next decade, the meaning of the term itself will be transformed even more, drifting even further away from past century’s “playful cleverness” era.

In the early days of the Internet there were only a few forms of malicious software – mostly viruses and trojans. The mass distribution of malware was also typical for that era. Nowadays hackers use a variety of new tools, including programs, which are fine-tuned to hunt down a specific victim.

Usually, it is very hard for an alligator to chase its prey on dry land. But once the victim approaches a small swamp to quench its thirst, the predator’s chances of having a proper dinner increase. This hunting technique is called “watering hole attack,” and, as it appears, alligators are not the only ones using it. Computer hackers, those who target a particular individual or company, developed a similar approach. They analyze a list of websites that their victims are visiting and inject malicious code into these pages making it easier for users to “swallow the bait”. Sometimes the code can be disguised as a simple visitor counter, which was modified to automatically install malware on the user’s computer.

Here is Cisco’s threat research and analysis team leader Craig Williams talking about tackling the watering hole attack.

Unfortunately, simple patching isn’t always a solution because we have seen things that are 0-day. That means that no one saw them before and no patch exists. If there is a patch – obviously apply the patch, but if there is no patch, defense in depth is your friend. And even if you’re patched you should look for indicators that you’re compromised, because users may visit those websites outside your secure network. They may take their laptop home, and they may not log in with a VPN.

However, the “watering hole” technique is not the only one used by hackers to steal data from your computer. Usually, the threats are mixed – with “good old fashioned” trojans, viruses and exploits, which are also being used to infiltrate target PCs. For instance, hackers can apply the “spear phishing” method to send personalized emails to particular users, which contains links to “watering hole” fake websites, which mimic popular web pages.

Trojans, malicious programs disguised as JPEG and other files, which were often used in the 2000s by hackers to gain access to desktop and laptop PCs, recently made a powerful comeback on handheld devices – smartphones and tablets. In 2016 alone more than 8 million smartphones were infected with malicious installation packages.

Such sophisticated methods are making it hard for users to stay safe on the Internet. However, computer security experts recommend updating anti-virus software as often as possible in addition to using common sense. Basically, pay more attention to details, and if you get a suspicious email, don’t click on the links, even if the letter looks like an important message from your bank, your friends or your colleagues.

Engineers started experimenting with the first wearable computers back in the 1970s. While the first prototypes, which already had some AR capabilities, were large and bulky, over time the introduction of new memory chips and processors allowed designers to make these devices smaller, lighter and more powerful.

Steve Mann is a radio engineer and wearable computing pioneer, who built his first augmented reality device long before the digital era. The gadget was capable of visualizing electric and other waveforms by creating graphic representations. Here’s Steve describing his invention in a keynote video for the AR-in-Action conference.

“It has terminals that I can use to pick up different signals. It allowed me to pick up television signals and radio waves and sound waves and so on, and to display them as an augmented reality overlays. So I waved this light stick back and forth and these lights are connected to here, there are 35 lights in five groups of seven, connected by 12 wires. It allowed me to create augmented realities and present this to audiences of hundreds of people who could see this all at the same time without any special glasses or any other special apparatus.”

Steve’s ideas evolved over time. His wearable computers became lighter and more portable. In the 1980’s he had to carry a backpack full of equipment and wear a big helmet, which probably looked more like Doc Brown’s crazy gadgets from Back to the Future than something useful. But now Mann’s equipment is sleek, efficient and lightweight – very similar to what other developers have shown in devices like Google Glass, but with extended brainwave sensing capabilities.

Currently, there are many augmented reality and augmented virtual reality products on the market. In 2016, Microsoft started selling its Hololens mixed reality glasses. Later that year, the software giant announced the global expansion of the project, which was previously only targeting the US and other markets, such as Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, France and the UK.

HoloLens and Kinect creator Alex Kipman says that thanks to these new gadgets, people are already able to enhance their perception of life. Here is Kipman talking about HoloLens applications in his 2016 TED talk.

Engineers started experimenting with the first wearable computers back in the 1970s. While the first prototypes, which already had some AR capabilities, were large and bulky, over time the introduction of new memory chips and processors allowed designers to make these devices smaller, lighter and more powerful.

Steve Mann is a radio engineer and wearable computing pioneer, who built his first augmented reality device long before the digital era. The gadget was capable of visualizing electric and other waveforms by creating graphic representations. Here’s Steve describing his invention in a keynote video for the AR-in-Action conference.

“It has terminals that I can use to pick up different signals. It allowed me to pick up television signals and radio waves and sound waves and so on, and to display them as an augmented reality overlays. So I waved this light stick back and forth and these lights are connected to here, there are 35 lights in five groups of seven, connected by 12 wires. It allowed me to create augmented realities and present this to audiences of hundreds of people who could see this all at the same time without any special glasses or any other special apparatus.”

Steve’s ideas evolved over time. His wearable computers became lighter and more portable. In the 1980’s he had to carry a backpack full of equipment and wear a big helmet, which probably looked more like Doc Brown’s crazy gadgets from Back to the Future than something useful. But now Mann’s equipment is sleek, efficient and lightweight – very similar to what other developers have shown in devices like Google Glass, but with extended brainwave sensing capabilities.

Currently, there are many augmented reality and augmented virtual reality products on the market. In 2016, Microsoft started selling its Hololens mixed reality glasses. Later that year, the software giant announced the global expansion of the project, which was previously only targeting the US and other markets, such as Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, France and the UK.

HoloLens and Kinect creator Alex Kipman says that thanks to these new gadgets, people are already able to enhance their perception of life. Here is Kipman talking about HoloLens applications in his 2016 TED talk.

“I’m not thinking about a distance future, I’m talking about today. We are already seeing car companies like Volvo designing cars differently with Hololens, universities like Case Western redefining the way medical students learn, and my personal favorite – NASA is using HoloLens to let scientists explore planets holographically.”

In 2015 Google introduced Google Glass, adding an extra visual layer to people's reality. The project was terminated shortly after, following heated debates over privacy issues. However, it didn't stop other companies from developing their own augmented reality gadgets.

In 2013 a group of ""Glass explorers"" in the US got the chance to test a totally new gadget. For $1,500 each of them received a set of spectacles equipped with a camera, display and a built-in computer. The device called Google Glass was capable of understanding voice commands and recording a video of everything that the wearers saw. However, the gadget's main feature was augmented reality (or AR) – the capability of projecting a supplementary layer of information onto an advanced LED panel.

Google Glass users were able to access email, look at maps and enjoy social media applications, as well as third-party apps. But the project was suspended not long after the first devices were marketed to the public. A heated debate raged over possible unauthorized videotaping and facial recognition. Some businesses announced anti-Google Glass policies way before the device was actually made available to the public. In Russia law enforcement agents could have easily seized the gadget because of its spying capabilities, and wearing Google Glass may have even been a criminal offense.

However, Google's negative experience didn't stop other companies from working on similar projects. In 2016 Snapchat started selling their own camera-equipped glasses called Spectacles for $130 a piece. Snapchat marketed the product as a fun toy, rather than serious gadget. The company's CEO Evan Spiegel told The Journal that Snapchat will ""roll out"" Spectacles very slowly so that Snapchat could figure out how they fit into people's lives and see how they like it.

Even though technically Spectacles are not as advanced as Google Glass when it comes to AR capabilities, videos from the gadget are still being uploaded into Snapchat galleries, which is only likely to inflame the debate over privacy.

However, as social networks are set to play an even more important role in people's daily lives, AR gadgets may very well make a powerful comeback.

Veteran computer graphics developer Jon Peddie says that by 2020 humans will be wearing AR glasses which will be capable of displaying useful information, such as directions and translations, as well as recording video. He adds, that in just a few years disputes over AR's privacy will not matter as much as they do today.

""In a world of nation-backed hackers and with laws that now allow ISPs to sell your browsing history and other information about you, in a world with WikiLeaks, and spy magazine, and other privacy intrusions and security break-ins, the romantic and idealistic notion of security and privacy is something we tell ourselves we have to protect, and does not exist.""

Other tech giants, such as Facebook are working on their own AR gadgets. The company recently launched a new Camera Effects Platform for developers, which allows adding an AR-layer to Facebook's multimedia content.

While augmented reality is becoming a very popular tool for video game developers, its capabilities go well beyond digital entertainment. Doctors use AR to study the human body and police are testing AR-enabled body cameras for crime scene investigation.

If Sherlock Holmes saw how Dutch police are using smartphones and body cameras, he would have probably reconsidered some of his famous deduction techniques. A joint project between the Dutch police, the Netherlands Forensic Institute and the Dutch Fire Brigade relies on technology developed by a company called Twinkl to help investigators sort out objects at the crime scene. A video feed from officers' body cameras is being supplemented with an additional visual layer to help find important clues. For instance, an agent who just busted a suspected drug lab will instantly get a notification on his smartphone to bag a bottle of chemicals which can be used as evidence.

Augmented reality, or AR, is a method of adding a supplemental layer of visual information to a live video feed. Usually it requires gadgets like smartphones, tablets, and special headsets. Even though the first descriptions of AR can be found in the early 1900's sci-fi, the first working AR-enabled gadgets appeared in 1980's and the 1990's.

While AR may very well become a great crime-fighting weapon for law enforcement agents chasing bad guys, it's also a powerful tool for doctors who save people's lives.

An Israel-based company, Augmedics, developed a head-mounted display called the Vizor, which gives surgeons the power to literally look inside a human body.

Here is Augmedics' vice president in charge of research and development Stuart Wolf talking about the new gadget:

The Vizor allows surgeons to see the patient's anatomy through soft tissue and skin, just as if they had x-ray vision. Using our patent-pending technology, we are able to project a patient's anatomy directly onto the surgeon's retina with surgical precision in real time and achieve outstanding depth perception.

© Sputnik/ Alexandr Kryazhev How AR Technology Helped Game Developers in Creating a New Dimension

In addition to surgeons, nurses and physicians also make use of AR in situations where it's hard to see something with the naked eye. A device called VeinViewer uses near-infrared vision to find and map human veins and to project them onto a patient's skin.

AR, along with virtual reality technology, is currently on the rise. According to a recent report by Analisys Group, the total combined economic potential of AR and VR may reach up to $102 billion by the year 2020. The same report also suggests that medicine, including surgery and diagnostics, may become the largest projected area, with 35% of the global AR/VR market.

In 2016 the augmented reality game Pokemon Go became a global phenomenon and an extremely profitable mobile app. However, the game's developer Niantic wasn't first in creating an alternate digital layer of reality, which captured the imagination of gaming fans worldwide.

When you launch your favorite smartphone navigation software, monsters would probably be the last thing you'd expect to see on screen next right next to your favorite supermarket. But that is exactly what happens in the Parallel Kingdom – a mobile app, which layers an interactive alternate reality on top of your town's map. Created in 2008 by Wisconsin-based company PerBlue, this location-based role-playing game was the first application of its kind for Android and iOS. The Parallel Kingdom was distributed freely and allowed users to claim territory on the map and protect it by challenging other players in duels.

The game eventually went through five iterations and received numerous industry awards – from being Best Augmented Reality Game of 2009, to becoming a finalist in the Mashable 2011 awards among Best Mobile Games.

In 2012, four years after its launch, Parallel Kingdom had 1.8 million subscribers.

Here is how PerBlue's community development manager Ellie Humphrey explained the game's popularity in her interview on Beau Hindman's YouTube channel:

I think the first reason it's because it's been around the longest. So, we have kind of organically grown within four years, so that's the big reason. I think the second reason, is because it's such a deep game, there's so many things that you can do and different ways you can play it… And, I think the third reason is that we're updating, we're always adding new missions, new quests, new legendary monsters, there's always on the horizon, some element of surprise.

Augmented reality, or AR, is a technology, which allows adding augmented or supplemented elements to live view of the real-world environment. Video game development is just one of AR's applications. It's being widely used in medicine, aviation, literature, design and commerce.

AR applications rely heavily on the host device's hardware. They often require several crucial components – mobile connectivity, a high-resolution camera and precise geolocation services.

9 years ago, when the Parallel Kingdom was released, there weren't too many mobile devices on the market capable of supporting immersive AR content.

But in 2016, when many smartphones were getting quad-core and octa-core central processing units, AR-enabled games gained momentum.

San-Francisco-based Niantic released Pokemon Go, which allowed players to catch and train imaginary monsters which were roaming around in an environment, which was skillfully merged with live smartphone camera video.

According to Global Industry Analysts, in the coming years, the mobile augmented reality market is only going to get bigger, and AR-enabled games will become one of the major growth categories.

Augmented reality is now being used in dozens of applications – in space exploration, medicine, video games and archaeology. But even though it relies heavily on today's technology, AR, which adds extra visual layers to reality, was first mentioned way before the invention of TVs, computers and smartphones.

In the 1901 sci-fi novel ""The Master Key,"" a teenage boy summons ""The Demon of Electricity"" and starts receiving mysterious gifts, with one of them looking a lot like today's augmented reality gadgets. Here is how the author of the novel L. Frank Baum describes the device:

""It consists of this pair of spectacles. While you wear them every one you meet will be marked upon the forehead with a letter indicating his or her character. The good will bear the letter 'G,' the evil the letter 'E.' The wise will be marked with a 'W' and the foolish with an 'F.' The kind will show a 'K' upon their foreheads and the cruel a letter 'C.' Thus you may determine by a single look the true nature of all those you encounter.""

What L. Frank Baum's readers might have considered to be almost impossible, became reality later in the 20th century. The experiments to add extra layers to reality started in the 1950s and 60s and went on throughout 1980s. They gained momentum with the growing popularity of personal computers and the appearance of smaller high resolution displays. EyeTap – a wearable device with a camera, which added computer-generated visuals in real time to what the operator saw, first appeared in 1978. But it wasn't until 2013 that such technology became commercially available, as Google started selling its augmented reality device called Google Glass for $1,500. However, the tech giant abandoned the project following controversy over privacy and safety concerns.

Augmented reality, or AR, is a live direct or indirect view of reality, which is supplemented or altered by computer-generated visuals, audio or GPS data. Currently, besides special glasses or helmets, the technology is widely available on smartphones and tablets.

Surprisingly enough, unlike many other gifts, which were given to the protagonist of ""The Master Key"" by the Demon of Electricity, the modern version of ""magic glasses"" powered by artificial intelligence is now quite close to reading people's minds. An app called Magic uses smartphone cameras to scan faces and is able to accurately interpret human emotions, such as fear, anger and happiness. Then the app augments the live video feed with animated tears, hearts or flames.

Besides video games and entertainment, AR is being widely used in other fields. In archeology it helps to visually rebuild ancient ruins, in medicine it's a great way to teach surgeons and medical students. Tourists can use augmented reality apps to enhance their sightseeing experience, musicians find it quite handy in teaching people to play instruments.

It's expected, that the virtual and augmented reality markets grow even more in the coming years. According to Digital-Capital.com, by 2021 mobile AR could become the primary driver of a combined VR/AR $108-billion market.

Imagine the future 900 years from now, where our planet is part of the United Empire Of Earth, and it’s really hard to become citizen of that empire. This is the plot of the videogame “Star Citizen”, which is currently being developed as a crowdfunded project.

The makers of “Star Citizen” coined the term “first-person universe” to describe their game. Players are free to do anything they like, whether it’s space flight itself, first-person shooting sequences or economic and social tasks that help characters achieve their goals.

The project was launched by Chris Roberts’ company, Cloud Imperium Games, with the help of thousands of gamers. In 2012 Roberts, who is also known for the 1990s space games series Wing Commander, launched a crowdfunding campaign – first in a blog, and then on Kickstarter. Within the following five years the campaign generated more than $150 million dollars, at one point even putting the title into Guinness Book Of Records as “most-funded crowdfunding project anywhere”.

John Erskine – the head of Cloud Imperium Games Texas Studio and the publishing head at Roberts Space Industries, told Sputnik that at first many supporters of the game were from older generations of gamers – people who used to play the Wing Commander series back in the 1990s, but over time the trend changed with even younger players joining the campaign.

When it comes to technology, Star Citizen uses many features that can be found in today’s space exploration games, like procedural generation of objects, but according to John Erskine, the approach to procedural generation and other aspects at Cloud Imperium Games is different: instead of just creating generic planets, the developers focus on immersion and authenticity.

What it really is – is a tool for our designers to be able to rapidly create authentic planets and worlds that are based on procedural generation, but by doing that it allows us to create more content faster, which adds to immersion as well: there are new places to explore and those places are handcrafted with the aid of procedural planet technology – we thought that would be really cool.

Star Citizen is currently in its testing stage and developers are planning to release a major update in the summer of 2017. But unlike many other titles, the game might become a long-running series instead of one finalized title, with new DLCs (or downloadable content packages) being released constantly. Here is what John Erskine told Sputnik about the developers’ plans:

I believe throughout the course of this year all the major systems that we’ve talked about will be online and playable, Hopefully, as long as people are interested in doing it, and funding it, and playing it – then we’ll continue doing it, so hopefully it’s gonna be years and years to come.

Even though this game will remain in development for several years, many players are already putting parts of Star Citizen to the test. So for those who like “sandbox” games, and prefer to expand their in-game world to distant galaxies and unexplored planets, this project is a must-see.

Imagine the future 900 years from now, where our planet is part of the United Empire Of Earth, and it’s really hard to become citizen of that empire. This is the plot of the videogame “Star Citizen”, which is currently being developed as a crowdfunded project.

The makers of “Star Citizen” coined the term “first-person universe” to describe their game. Players are free to do anything they like, whether it’s space flight itself, first-person shooting sequences or economic and social tasks that help characters achieve their goals.

The project was launched by Chris Roberts’ company, Cloud Imperium Games, with the help of thousands of gamers. In 2012 Roberts, who is also known for the 1990s space games series Wing Commander, launched a crowdfunding campaign – first in a blog, and then on Kickstarter. Within the following five years the campaign generated more than $150 million dollars, at one point even putting the title into Guinness Book Of Records as “most-funded crowdfunding project anywhere”.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) — The embassy told RIA Novosti earlier in the day that the US diplomats have been denied access to a diplomatic summer house in Moscow for the past two days despite the Russian Foreign Ministry's announcement last week that the access would be suspended from August 1.

""We perceive as a deliberate provocation the US Embassy claims that it has been denied access to the summer house ahead of the deadline,"" the source told RIA Novosti.

Cargo vehicles are not allowed in the Serebryanny Bor area as it is considered a nature reserve, the source added.

""The Americans simply did not bother to inform the Moscow department of environmental protection in advance…that they were going to send three large trucks there,"" the source said.

""When the Russian Foreign Ministry urgently resolved the matter on July 31, and security staff wanted to issue permissions for [US] embassy employees to enter… the reserve, they drove away upon command,"" the source noted.

The source added that the embassy staff was expected to return on Tuesday morning but ""US diplomats continued to tell the media that they had allegedly been prevented [from entering the area].""

On Thursday, the Russian Foreign Ministry called on Washington to cut down the number of diplomats and technical staff of diplomatic missions in Russia to 455 people, on par with Russia's diplomatic representation in the United States, by September 1. It also said that from August 1, Russia would suspend the use of all warehouses in Moscow and a compound in the Serebryany Bor park by the US embassy.

On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the personnel of the US diplomatic missions in Russia would be cut by 755 people.

Russia's move came as a response to a series of measures implemented by the United States. Last week, both chambers of the US Congress approved a bill imposing new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea, as well as limiting US President Donald Trump's ability to lift the anti-Moscow restrictions.

In December 2016, Washington adopted sanctions targeting Russia over its alleged interference in the US presidential election, something which Moscow has repeatedly denied, expelling 35 Russian diplomats and seizing two diplomatic compounds used by Russia."

MOSCOW (Sputnik) — The Russian Foreign Ministry asked the United States on Friday to reduce the number of the personnel of its embassy in Russia to the level commensurate with that of the Russian Embassy in the United States by September 1. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday that the diplomatic presence of the United States in Russia would be decreased by 755 employees.

""If they are members of trade unions, naturally, the trade union will make sure that the law is not broken when they are being dismissed, that the severance packages are paid,"" Shmakov said.

The chairman of the trade unions federation said that the US employers may face financial and legal liability if the Russian employees are dismissed in breach of legislation.

Shmakov stressed that only trade union members could turn to the organizations for help.

Russia's decision came as a response to a series of measures implemented or mulled by the United States.

Last week, both chambers of the US Congress approved a bill introducing economic sanctions on Russia, with the White House stating that President Donald Trump is intending to sign the bill into law.

In December 2016, Washington adopted sanctions targeting Russia over its alleged interference in the US presidential election, something which Moscow has repeatedly denied, expelling 35 Russian diplomats and seizing two diplomatic compounds used by Russia."

In another eloquent piece of magic the UN delivered a staggering account of how opioids are destroying our society. It’s not the numbers that are really that surprising, rather the tone. As if the people who wrote it did not know that Afghanistan has been increasingly accounting for more and more opium production to the point it is now a monopoly. As if the people who wrote it did not know that the increase in production is directly proportional to the amount of years US, UK, and other troops are stationed there.

Poland has been rocked by nationwide protests that the opposition framed as a new Solidarity movement but which was condemned by government supporters as a Soros-backed regime change operation.

The ruling Law and Justice Party, also known by its abbreviation PiS, secured the country’s first-ever parliamentary majority in the last elections, and has since embarked on a quest to reshape the country in line with its conservative values. Part of this mission involves reforming the country’s Constitutional Court to remove the judges that the Civil Platform opposition party, popularly referred to by its abbreviation PO, installed just prior to their electoral defeat. PiS understands that it must absolutely succeed in this endeavor if it’s to stand any chance at executing its long-term national vision for Poland.

It’s precisely for this reason, however, that PO marshalled tens of thousands of its supports to oppose PiS’ efforts, taking advantage of the fact that former PO leader and one-time Prime Minister Donald Tusk is now President of the European Council and is actively involved in turning liberal EU institutions against the new conservative Polish government. From the perspective of PO, its supporters, and an increasing number of influential voices in the EU, the PiS authorities in Poland are “dismantling democracy” and taking the country on the path of a “dictatorship” which they derisively compare to Hungarian leader Vikor Orban’s pro-sovereignty government. For these dramatic reasons, they also liken their current anti-government struggle to the one that their parents waged a generation ago in forming Solidarity to oppose the communists.

From the reverse perspective, however, Polish Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski accused “media conglomerates, banks and international corporations” of conspiring to stage “attempts to overthrow the government”, remarking that “the question of courts, reforms… is only an excuse.” Although not directly stated, comments such as his are usually regarded as euphemisms that George Soros and his shadowy network of “activists” are involved in one way or another, an idea which has also been floated around by others. They believe that the transnational neoliberal elite of the EU are provoking a Color Revolution scenario in the country in order to punish it for refusing to abide by Brussels’ migrant demands and other unilateral impositions of the bloc’s will.

Our final topic, picked by you, dear listeners, earlier in a poll on our Facebook page, is “China & India: Walking The Himalayan Tightrope”, focusing on the rising tensions between the two most populous countries in the world.

The high-stakes political drama between Asian giants China and India over the Donglang Plateau, also known as the Doklam Plateau, has turned the seemingly stable Himalayan region into a zone of intense Great Power competition.

China began work on modernizing an isolated road near the tri-junction of the its mountainous border with Bhutan and India in mid-June, but Bhutan regarded this Chinese-administered territory as ""disputed"" and apparently requested support from its Indian ally to stop the construction.

Incidentally, this occurred around the time that Indian Prime Minister Modi was visiting the US to meet with President Trump.

India holds a modern-day protectorate of sorts over Bhutan owing to historical circumstances and believes that it is responsible for its neighbor's defense when called upon, though China disputes the entire matter and argues that the problem is a bilateral issue between itself and Bhutan, and that India should never have gotten involved. The two nominal BRICS and SCO partners have since been engaged in a very tense standoff in the Chinese-administered territory that Beijing claims as its own, with each opposing side positioning their troops just a few meters apart from one another.

China asserts that an 1890 treaty that it signed with the UK settled the frontier between what are now the People's Republic and the independent state of India once and for all, though many Indian voices counter that neither their side nor the Bhutanese were involved in these negotiations and that the agreement is therefore illegitimate. Although official figures in Beijing and New Delhi have largely attempted to downplay the unresolved incident for now, their respective national medias have enthusiastically embraced their country's cause and made hard-hitting rhetorical cases against the other.

It's in the context of this escalating information war and ongoing standoff that Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj stated last week that ""If China unilaterally changes the status quo of the trijunction point, then that is a direct challenge to our security"", which prompted her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi to soon thereafter request that Indian forces ""conscientiously withdraw"". As the situation continues to simmer, observers are wondering how and why two supposed multipolar partners are now experiencing their worst crisis in decades and seem to startlingly be on the brink of war with one another.

Saikat Bhattacharyya, Research scholar in Economics at Jadavpur University in Kolkata, and Dong Chao, Chinese political commentator, discussed the issue.

The Trump Administration has been on a sanctions spree lately by targeting North Korea, Venezuela, Iran, and Russia in an asymmetrical show of force which fuses finance with geostrategy.

All four countries are already under differing degrees of sanctions by the US, but Trump wants to tighten the screws against each of them for various reasons. Pyongyang and Tehran have both already come under more unilateral economic restrictions by Washington due to their missile programs, while Caracas stands ready to face the wrath of the US’ financial warfare instruments due to its impending pro-democracy actions in assembling a new constituent assembly. As for Moscow, it’s been the victim of a “deep state” witch hunt for months now originating from the fake news allegations that it interfered in the US’ 2016 elections.

As a show of force, the US Congress is on the verge of passing a broad sanctions bill which will impose penalties against North Korea, Iran, and Russia, showing that these sorts of measures remain one of America’s preferred means of destabilizing its adversaries.

Sanctions have long been a tool of American foreign policy for decades, but they rarely achieve any visibly tangible dividends. More often than not, instead of toppling the governments and national elite that they’re usually directed against, they lead to unnecessary burdens and humanitarian difficulties for the vast majority of the population and their civil societies. Granted, the US believes that this tactic is useful in order to turn people against their governments, but there has yet to be a case where this policy has inarguably succeeded in the way that it was intended. It’s indeed feasible that sanctions could lead to elite infighting in some of the targeted states which destabilizes their leaderships and creates openings for Color Revolutions to succeed, though this is more wishful strategic thinking than a solidly provable concept.

In spite of the controversy surrounding them, and whether the motivation behind them is just a political fantasy or a credible long-term plot, there’s no denying the fact that sanctions still remain part and parcel of American foreign policy, and that the Trump Administration isn’t shy about wielding this asymmetrical weapon.

To discuss all these issues we are happy to be joined by Vladimir Rodzianko, managing director at The Duran, and Gordon Hahn, Senior Researcher at the Center for Terrorism and Intelligence Studies at Akribus Group, and expert at Corr Analytics.

People all over the world are protesting against globalisation, inequality and selfishness. Democratic liberalism is supposed to solve these problems, but liberalism and its big brother neoliberalism are actually the cause of these problems. Furthermore, once a country has adopted neoliberalist policies it is very hard for it ever to reject them.

Dr. Alfredo Saad Filho, from the department of Development Studies, SOAS, University of London, discusses these issues.

Dr. Filho starts the program by describing what neoliberalism is. He says that it is usually presented as a set of policies which roll back the welfare state, which endorse power for the rich. But neoliberalism has become more than that, he says. “It is a way to organize the economy, a way to organize society and the political system, around the logic of finance, the logic of extracting the maximum value that is possible from every single aspect of human interaction. This penetrates every area of social life, through privatization, through legislation attempting to force people into the labor market so that their value can be extracted from them, and so on…”

On so called ‘Liberal Democracy,’ Dr. Filho describes the international institutions which we currently have such as the UN, the IMF and informal instructions like the Davos Summit as not being very democratic. “They are inserted into the framework of global liberalism, and they have adopted the name of democracy and are institutions which serve the interests of a very small section of humanity. To call them democratic is a misdemeanor, it is not correct to say that the market can regulate these institutions. The rich can promote their own international agendas which are representative of this very small layer of humanity which runs international institutions, in order to give them legitimacy…”

The question of freedom is discussed. Dr. Filho says that liberal democracy does bring a sense of freedom: “there is freedom to trade, to make money, to accumulate profit, it is not freedom to have your human rights recognized. It is not freedom to have your basic needs satisfied.”

The process of neoliberalism of economies is discussed. Dr. Filho says: “economies change usually because of a combination of internal and external pressures. The processes can be very different. …Once you allow neoliberalism in you are changing power relations within society, you are changing the makeup of society itself, and this makes it very difficult for a reversal to occur. Once the process starts it tightens as it moves along, although it does have moments of instability and crisis as we can see today.”

Dr. Filho is somewhat optimistic because he sees that many people are realizing that neoliberalism is creating massive inequality and not solving economic problems. “Today we see two types of movements; from the left, with Bernie Sanders in the US, Corbyn in the UK and many other similar movements, and we also see a questioning of neoliberalism from the right – you see Brexit, you see Trump and others…”

The signing into law of one of three contested bills restricting the independence of Poland’s judiciary by Poland’s President, will probably result in action from Brussels. Polish critics portray the President as bowing to the will of hostile foreign powers. What are the underlying reasons for this very serious situation?

Remi Adekoya, a former political editor of the Warsaw Business Journal, and Magdalena Szmidt, a Polish lawyer and women’s rights activist participate in this program.

Remi starts off the program describing that the implications of this new law mean that the justice minister, within the first 6th months, will be able to dismiss the president of any of Poland’s lower courts (the ones that most cases are heard in), without having to give any justification. “Because some of the presidents of these lower courts are going to be afraid of losing their jobs, they might be pliant to the political wishes of the ruling party or the justice minister, plus, [after the first 6 months] because the justice minister can now appoint presidents of these courts, there is a fear that these courts will be staffed with the minister’s own people. The fear is that all of Poland’s courts under the Supreme Court will be politicized from this day on,” Remi says. Magdalena concurs: “the separation of powers in Poland has now ended.”

Why isn’t the EU doing anything?, is the next question. Magdalena says that Brussels will press for sanctions under Article 7, against Poland. “Brussels should press charges against Poland and Hungary simultaneously, striping us of our rights to vote,” she says, and continues that she does believe that the European Court of Justice will find a way to apply such disciplinary treatment. Remi describes the actual time periods and processes involved in implementing such actions, however host John Harrison raises doubts that anything will actually be done at all, given the complexity of the EU bureaucracy. Remi says that the Polish government has been abrasive in its actions, “they could have been more diplomatic,” he says, and this has upset the Brussels administration. Remi also says that “I believe the Polish government will take a step back.”

Magdalena says that the Catholic Church is now wielding too much power, and says that she thinks that the Polish government is paying the Church. The role of the Church in Polish politics is discussed. “If you want to do something, fine, but don’t force it on other people,” she says.

The involvement of the United States in this situation is touched on. “The US government has played a role in legitimizing the Polish government over the past two years… everything is being done to facilitate American investments in the energy section over the next few years… the Poles are being led to believe that a close relationship with the US is the best defense against Russia, that is what the Poles are being led to believe,” says Remi. Many other issues are discussed in this intense debate.

The signing into law of one of three contested bills restricting the independence of Poland’s judiciary by Poland’s President, will probably result in action from Brussels. Polish critics portray the President as bowing to the will of hostile foreign powers. What are the underlying reasons for this very serious situation?

In 2014, a US airstrike killed Ahmed Abdi Godane, the organization's leader. When Donald Trump became president, he temporarily halted the airstrikes to reevaluate American involvement in Somalia.

The offer comes after China’s fleet began to sail to its first overseas base in the Horn of Africa. Sputnik spoke with a military analyst about this issue.

Kuang Weilin, the Chinese ambassador to the African Union, suggested that China would consider sending troops to the border between the two East African countries, The Associated Press reported on Monday.

He stressed that China is willing to act as a mediator if needed.

Last week, China dispatched a military contingent to its first overseas military base in Djibouti , in the Horn of Africa, so the offer comes amid the increasing presence in the continent.

In an interview with Sputnik, Russian military analyst Vladimir Yevseyev said that the strengthening of the role of China as a major political player in Africa and the Middle East would possibly further disturb the US, as with China rising, the US feels threatened.

However, the question regarding the ability of China to fully cope with the peacekeeper's mission between Djibouti and Eritrea, despite the solid experience of participating in UN peacekeeping missions, remains contentious.

“China is trying to claim itself as a political player who is able to resolve armed conflicts. Yet, it is not clear how much China will cope with this task because China has no great experience in such activities,” Yevseyev said.

In addition, he said that for the settlement of armed conflicts, it is necessary to have special equipment of the armed forces. These are units that have special light weapons and ammunitions.

Furthermore, the peacekeepers should also have the skills to communicate with the local population in English, and also extensive training of the personnel for such peacekeeping operations is required.

“I'm not yet sure that China is able to fully cope with this task. However, the fact that China declares its readiness for a peacekeeping operation indicates that China is gradually becoming a political center of power,” Yevseyev said.

According to the analyst, China’s growing influence is a concern for the US, Japan and South Korea.

Despite that, China’s offer to act as a mediator is seen by some as a positive diplomatic gesture.

An expert of the Diplomatic Academy of China, Ren Yuanzhe, noted that mediation in overcoming international conflicts has become a trend of Chinese diplomacy.

“The trend of development of Chinese diplomacy in recent years is characterized by activity, initiative and offensiveness. It consistently shows an example of the diplomacy of a major power. This applies equally to China's approach to international conflicts in the Middle East and South Asia,” Yuanzhe said.

He further said that the power of China's influence is gradually expanding from Asia to the whole world.

The conflict between Djibouti and Eritrea began in the 1990s. In 2000, Qatar deployed peacekeepers into the zone of the territorial dispute, but the conflict has since grown.

“Against this background, as a responsible major power, China has declared its position, because Africa occupies an important place in Chinese diplomacy. With the realization of the One belt, One Road project we want to bring development and prosperity to the African region,” the analyst said.

Meanwhile, the conflict between Djibouti and Eritrea is capable of splitting regional stability and is not conducive to the development of China's cooperation with African countries.

“If China does not come there as an intermediary, then it will be done by other, Western states,” he said.

“Participation and mediation of China in the protection of peace and stability in the region is based on non-interference in domestic policy, creating a favorable framework for the conflicting parties for negotiations,” Yuanzhe concluded."

The offer comes after China’s fleet began to sail to its first overseas base in the Horn of Africa. Sputnik spoke with a military analyst about this issue.

Kuang Weilin, the Chinese ambassador to the African Union, suggested that China would consider sending troops to the border between the two East African countries, The Associated Press reported on Monday.

He stressed that China is willing to act as a mediator if needed.

Last week, China dispatched a military contingent to its first overseas military base in Djibouti , in the Horn of Africa, so the offer comes amid the increasing presence in the continent.

In an interview with Sputnik, Russian military analyst Vladimir Yevseyev said that the strengthening of the role of China as a major political player in Africa and the Middle East would possibly further disturb the US, as with China rising, the US feels threatened.

However, the question regarding the ability of China to fully cope with the peacekeeper's mission between Djibouti and Eritrea, despite the solid experience of participating in UN peacekeeping missions, remains contentious.

“China is trying to claim itself as a political player who is able to resolve armed conflicts. Yet, it is not clear how much China will cope with this task because China has no great experience in such activities,” Yevseyev said.

In addition, he said that for the settlement of armed conflicts, it is necessary to have special equipment of the armed forces. These are units that have special light weapons and ammunitions.

Furthermore, the peacekeepers should also have the skills to communicate with the local population in English, and also extensive training of the personnel for such peacekeeping operations is required.

“I'm not yet sure that China is able to fully cope with this task. However, the fact that China declares its readiness for a peacekeeping operation indicates that China is gradually becoming a political center of power,” Yevseyev said.

According to the analyst, China’s growing influence is a concern for the US, Japan and South Korea.

Despite that, China’s offer to act as a mediator is seen by some as a positive diplomatic gesture.

An expert of the Diplomatic Academy of China, Ren Yuanzhe, noted that mediation in overcoming international conflicts has become a trend of Chinese diplomacy.

“The trend of development of Chinese diplomacy in recent years is characterized by activity, initiative and offensiveness. It consistently shows an example of the diplomacy of a major power. This applies equally to China's approach to international conflicts in the Middle East and South Asia,” Yuanzhe said.

© REUTERS/ Marko Djurica UK Police Say There're Grounds for Manslaughter Charges Over Grenfell Tower Fire

The Grenfell Tower fire tore a community apart. In the days after the tragedy, missing picture posters of loved ones filled the streets.

However one month on, as bodies are identified and funerals take place, people are slowly coming to terms with their loss and the fact that this fire, which killed at least 80 people, really did happen.

The latest body to be identified was that of two-year-old Jeremiah Deen.

​Many of the survivors and family members of people who perished are suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) which is defined as an anxiety disorder caused by a very ""stressful, frightening or distressing event.""

Judy Bolton, a clinical nurse and coordinator of the Justice for Grenfell campaign told Sputnik that the help from local and national government has been minimal and more needs to be done to ensure those suffering from PTSD are helped.

""The UK government or gold command has said they will provide mental health services, to those who are traumatized and obviously in a terrible state. But they are expected to go to them and access these services. So it's not a referral, it's if you feel that you need mental health support, you have to go to them, which beggars belief as many people wouldn't recognize or even know the symptoms of stress, distress, trauma or suicide,"" Ms. Bolton told Sputnik.

​""This is an unprecedented event and I would have hoped that the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea would have actually seen the need to go to the survivors and bereaved families because they also are traumatized as well,"" Ms. Bolton added.

Judy Bolton is all too familiar with the symptoms of PTSD, as a trained clinical nurse, Ms. Bolton has seen the impact of the condition, comparing it to the grieving process.

People will be in denial, many will still be living in disbelief that this has happened, but soon the realization kicks in and the person, unable to cope with their loss and the situation, isolates themselves and stops talking in a bid to deal with the pain.

""With PTSD you are not able to rationally process, it's too much, and so people will go into themselves. Also they will go through erratic sleeping, sometimes not even sleeping. Also anxiety — it can paralyze you… You may see someone withdrawn and zapped out in a chair, not moving or blinking and they are locked in their own trauma,"" Ms. Bolton told Sputnik.

""I spoke to one gentlemen, he has worked all his life… he saved his partner and child from the fire, but now he has to sleep with the light on because he is scared to go to the bathroom at night,"" Ms Bolton said.

Signs of PTSD are palpitations, difficulty breathing, dizziness, sweating of hands and face. Ms. Bolton said people will also have an irrational fear of going outside and may develop agoraphobia.

Several reports of people trying to commit suicide have recently surfaced. Ms. Bolton is unable to discuss the details in order to protect people's privacy, but she says the trauma of surviving the fire has led many to want to commit suicide or self-medicate with drugs.

""The police are very aware of the drug dealers in the area. They are very aware of certain outlets that provide illicit drugs […]. We have had an influx of people outside of the area coming in to capitalize on the misery. Again those who seek to capitalize only have to ask questions, the drug dealers are more organized than gold command. Again, it's down to Notting Hill police to ensure they go to the outlets and shut these things down,"" Ms. Bolton told Sputnik

With cuts being made to every area of mental health, accessing support is not easy.

Ms. Bolton commends the local services that have helped thus far, but says waiting times are so long that support has had to be provided by the community.

""We have volunteers who go out at night and help those who can't sleep. Even at 3am you see people walking the streets as they can't sleep. So you have volunteers who will help people and talk to them.

""What we need is a safe place that is accessible 24 hours a day for people to be able to come and help, and receive help [….] People are in a real state and it's a collective state of PTSD,"" Ms. Bolton concluded.

If you know of someone suffering from PTSD since the Grenfell Tower incident, please contact the Justice for Grenfell website or the Samaritans."

MOSCOW (Sputnik) — In June, the environmental activists from the Reclaim the Power group announced that they would conduct ""creative and disruptive actions"" against hydraulic fracturing every working day of July protesting against the activities of the Cuadrilla energy company preparing to start fracking in Lancashire.

More than 70 activists have been detained during the actions that included ""lock-on"" blockades at the gates of the Preston New Road fracking site, the 2BR broadcaster reported.

The media outlet added citing a representative from Reclaim the Power that hundreds of people participated in the anti-fracking activities aimed at disrupting the activities of Cuadrilla.

According to the news outlet, during the last July event a woman strapped herself to a barrel near the Preston New Road.

In October 2016, London issued a permit to Cuadrilla to carry out fracking at Preston New Road, overturning the decision of Lancashire County Council to ban such activities in the area. In January, the company started construction of the infrastructure at the site, causing protests of local residents and environmentalists.

Hydraulic fracturing or fracking is a technology that allows extracting shale hydrocarbons by injecting pressurized toxic liquid into the ground. Fracking has been largely criticized by its opponents for the risks posed to environment and people's health, as well as for the tremors caused by the technology."

The current has gathered millions of tons of waste into one spot in the ocean to form a garbage pile that, if it were a country, would be the 30th largest in the world.

Trash islands are formed by ocean gyres, which are circulating ocean currents that gradually pull matter to their center. The South Pacific Gyres has slowly sucked in human-made garbage dumped in the water by Pacific-facing countries, forming the massive island of garbage.

The island was discovered by a team led by oceanographer Charles Moore with the Algalita Marine Research and Education in Long Beach, California. ""We discovered tremendous quantities of plastic,"" Moore, who was the first to discover the North Pacific garbage patch in the 1990s, told ResearchGate. ""My initial impression is that our samples compared to what we were seeing in the North Pacific in 2007, so it's about ten years behind.""

""We found a few larger items, occasionally a buoy and some fishing gear, but most of it was broken into bits,"" Moore added. ""We haven't yet done lab analysis, but based on my visual impression, an enormous area of the South Pacific has millions of plastic particles per square kilometer.""

Moore was the discoverer of the North Pacific garbage patch, which is estimated to be between 270,000 square miles (roughly the size of Texas) to 5,800,000 square miles (twice the size of Argentina) in 1999.

""There's a sense of urgency to get information out about this area because it's being destroyed at an enormously accelerated rate, said Moore. ""For much of the unexplored ocean, we will never have pre-plastic baseline data."" He estimates the trash island to be between 400,000 and 965,000 square miles (roughly the size of Zimbabwe and Egypt, respectively) in size.

Both Pacific patches appear to primarily consist of tiny, sometimes microscopic pieces of plastic. They post a major challenge to marine life, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a British environmental charity.

In January, the Foundation put out a report on behalf of the United Nations that claimed that at the current rate of dumping (""the ""equivalent to dumping the contents of one garbage truck into the ocean every minute,"") trash will outweigh fish in the world's oceans by 2050. Marine life can also mistakenly consume these plastic pieces, which are toxic to most forms of aquatic life.

Furthermore, due to their extremely small size, these plastic grains are virtually impossible to effectively clean up. Marcus Eriksen, a marine pollution researcher who discovered the South Pacific patch in 2011, says that the only way to prevent the islands from growing any further is to stop introducing the plastic into the oceans.

""Gone are the silly notions that you can put nets in the ocean and solve the problem,"" Eriksen told ResearchGate. ""This cloud of microplastics extends both vertically and horizontally. It's more like smog than a patch. We're making tremendous progress to clean up smog over our cities by stopping the source. We have to do the same for our seas."""

​Scientists are now questioning the future of Larsen C, as the years-long calving process has caused its area to shrink by 10 percent.

The US Air Force (USAF), which for decades used liberal amounts of poisonous firefighting foam in daily operations at local airbases, has refused to reimburse three small Colorado communities after water-purification efforts were implemented to counter toxins at levels some 1250 times above what the US Environmental Protection Agency claims is safe.

Highly toxic firefighting foam used at Peterson Air Force base has for years seeped into the groundwater of the Widefield Aquifer in the Centennial State's El Paso county, resulting in undrinkable water with dangerous levels of poisons.

Within the county, the towns of Security, Widefield and Fountain have spent an estimated $6 million to counter and contain the toxins — as well as to attempt to purify the water so that it can be safely used — with an additional projected $13 million to be spent by the end of 2018, according to a report from the Associated Press.

The USAF has offered lots of bottled water to the towns, as well as a promise that they will ""study"" the aquifer's destruction — but has flatly refused to reimburse any costs for the cleanup, according to Stars and Stripes.

The Air Force, in offering just $1.7 million for use by the water district as well as millions of dollars of consumer-grade filters and bottled water, is unrepentant, according to a spokesman for the force.

""We don't back pay — we cannot reimburse,"" asserted Cornell Long, a Air Force Civil Engineer Center chemist.

Local politicians have reacted strongly, although they too acknowledge that getting anyone within the military infrastructure to acknowledge responsibility is problematic at best.

""We really need financial help,"" stated Roy Heald, the Water and Sanitation District head for the town of Security, Colorado.

Agreeing that the USAF must accept responsibility for the poisoning of the water supply, and that the towns, the county, and the water district ""need to be compensated,"" Republican state Senator Bob Gardner of Colorado Springs added, ""the military needs to go ahead and step up,"" cited by Stripes.com.

The USAF reiterated its intention to ""study"" the issue through 2019, without offering to take any form of definitive action in addressing the county's foul water supply.

When asked for clarification, the USAF offered an email response.

""The Air Force does not have the authority to reimburse communities for costs incurred in dealing with environmental contamination issues.""

Rate hikes for water service are expected in the affected districts."

Russian Scientists Reveal the Secret of 'Red Tides' in the Sea,[],"Toxic red algae, causing ""bloody"" rains and tides in the Baltic, are rapidly spreading across the seas and oceans because they turned out to be absolute omnivores, Russian scientists found.

In recent years, Spain, the Caribbean Bay and some other regions have faced unusual phenomena — ""blood rains"" and red tides, which many religious people considered a sign of an early end of the world. Of course, there is nothing supernatural about it; these anomalies have come as a result of the rapid reproduction and blooming of brown algae. Now, large colonies of these organisms form red spots near the shores of Russia and the Baltic states.

Russian scientists from the Institute of Cytology of the Russian Academy of Science in St. Petersburg revealed the secret of the algae's ""survival success.""

""It turned out that Prorocentrum minimum [algae] can feed on both organic and inorganic compounds. Therefore, there are no such conditions in which these organisms would feel uncomfortable,"" said Sergei Skarlato from the Institute of Cytology, who led the research published in the Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science journal.

In addition, Scarlato and his colleagues found that at abnormally low salinity, these microorganisms dramatically increase their metabolic rate to compensate for the disruption in the work of DNA and proteins.

The combination of these factors, according to Skarlato, explains why the epidemic of ""blood tides"" have swept the Baltic so quickly. The ability to adapt to different conditions helped Prorocentrum minimum colonize unstable coastal ecosystems of the Baltic Sea.

""Red tides"" are extremely dangerous for other types of microbes and pose a threat to the populations of fish and birds, as well as to humans. This is due to brevetoxin, a nerve agent produced by these microorganisms. As scientists have recently discovered, the dangerous substance is produced when the algae lack certain elements. Thus, it starts to produce a sort of ""chemical weapon"" to destroy competitors and to slaughter potential sources of necessary substances.

By accumulating new data in the future, Russian scientists hope to predict and regulate these potentially toxic organisms."

Images of large deposits of what looks to be solidified molten lava-like rock in 3-foot layers were imaged under Fukushima's #3 reactor, according to a statement from the owner of the destroyed reactor Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO).

In revealing heavy damage to the reactor as a result of the core meltdown, the robot probe imaged debris mixed with destroyed reactor parts, leading technicians to suspect that what is projected to be a decades-long decommissioning process will be more difficult than initially thought.

A TEPCO spokesman stated that additional time would be required before the company can grasp the full scope of the disaster and assemble a coherent picture of the aftermath.

Extremely high radiation levels require that fresh water be continually pumped into the wrecked reactor to keep it cool, according to Deutsche Welle.

Robot probes have still not uncovered melted fuel in the two other damaged reactors due to the punishing radiation levels.

A charming little puff piece by the official UK state media has recently come out.

This is what obscure NATO spokesperson Oana Lungescu says about what the BBC are calling “sharply opinionated blogs.” Presumably this includes my own.

""If you look at the byline of people who write commentaries for Sputnik or RT, a lot of them are extremely obscure individuals connected to the far right or the far left, or so-called specialists or experts who nobody's heard of.”

So, I thought I’d give you all a little bit of a taster on who I really am.

I am the product of a profound metaphysical experience that occurred somewhere between the steppes of Genghis Khan’s Mongolia and the dusty ziggurats of Ancient Babylon.

My ancient noble bloodline contains many extremely obscure individuals connected to the far right or the far left such as Adolf Hitler, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, Nikolai Bukharin, Enver Hoxha, David Bowie, Freddy Mercury and Wurzel Gummidge.

At the age of ten, I was baptized in Hitler’s bunker, by a renegade extremely obscure individual connected to the Russian Czar known as Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin.

Soon after, I started school at a Madrassah run by an extremely obscure individual connected to the far right known as the King of Saudi Arabia.

I did not need to go to university, as I am, of course, a so-called specialist or expert who nobody's heard of.

I formed the Icelandic Heterosexual Illuminati and Meta-Neoliberal Union of Hebdophiliac Buddhismophobic Hate Criminals in 2012, in order to steadfastly oppose the impending threat of the Mayan Apocalypse. Fortunately, the dark arts of the Serbian Pansexual Jihadist Union of Stay at Home Anarcho-Otherkin Union Thugs did not prevail on this occasion.

My sharply opinionated manifestos brought about the fall of Saddam Hussein, the end of the Mubarak’s Presidency…

And better still, I managed to stop Lord Voldemort from hacking X Factor!

There are so many more things that can be said about me and my fellow Sputs-Under-The-Bed. Still, perhaps we’d better leave it here now.

After all, we wouldn’t want to be guilty of fake news now, would we?

Nah! I think I’ll leave that to the educated idiots who think Saddam had WMDs, Moderate choppers deserve Western support in their attempts to overthrow the ‘Assad Regime,’ and the governments of ‘our’ enemies (!) are populated by ‘alternative documentary’ cartoon characters like Fu Manchu, Jafar, and the Anna Amasova.

There’s a lot of talk nowadays about alternative facts.

Personally, I think some of those who hypocritically moralize about such would be better to interrogate their own ‘alternative reality.’

Because I don’t think that’s any less of a pressing problem right now.

A lot of the journalists in the pro-establishment faction of the media (albeit by no means all!) think that they are living in a James Bond movie.

Actually, they are more like grubby, hay-hopping medieval clerics who think they are doing something edgy and daring and awe-inspiringly heroic; speaking truth to power against dirty rabble-rousing serfs and peasants, or maybe even risking their neck with the odd silken-trousered princeling or two.

But Disney’s Aladdin, classic espionage movies and ‘Yellow Peril’ literature are not serious journalistic sources, for anyone who wants to conduct any remotely serious portrayal of what is actually going on in ‘bad countries.’ Fantasy is fun, but when the suppurating fantasies of over-fertile imaginations start seeping and bleeding into brute reality, then that’s when everyone has a problem.

By the way, one last thing. Quite a number of the ‘alternative facts’ I told about my life history above were entirely fictional.

However, if you think that it is stupid to believe all of those tall tales I have just blarneyed up, but that paying uncritical attention to the CIA (perpetrators of the Nazi-like MK Ultra Project), or ‘anonymous sources’ from the Washington Post, then you might want to consider whether you and your comrades are part of the problem.

As I said in another article of mine:

Post truth is as post truth does!

Alternative facts were perfectly fine for some years or decades, if not longer.

Or at the very worst, they were human errors: the proverbial Blairite ‘honest mistakes’ of those whose ‘good intentions,’ needless to say, are utterly unimpeachable in all cases. There has never been the slightest hint of neglect or of any failure of due diligence; let alone (far less so!) conscious and deliberate complicity with evil agendas, ideologies or institutions.

And now, all of a sudden, ‘alternative facts’ are bad.

Well, I have news for you.

Alternative facts were always bad.

And if you think misleading public discourse is wicked and destructive when it comes from Pyongyang or Tehran or Rangoon, and not when it comes from a ‘good country’ or any one of the myriad ‘civilized media outlets’ of ‘the great and the good…’

Then there is absolutely nothing whatsoever to separate you from the most hidebound, embittered, bigoted, rigidly inflexible and hate-ridden Salafi shill or Korean Tankie.

Think on.

However, the choppers are starting to fly too high, and are likely to come down to earth with a bump. Let's help them out with that one!

Islamists and jihadists have made a serious miscalculation.

Their twin weapons of violent/terroristic and ideological/cultural jihad, as exemplified by the appalling Manchester and London atrocities, have not resulted in a quiescent submission.

Although some elitist metropolitan intellectuals have laid down their arms, and chosen to become Dhimmis, Useful Infidels and People of the Book, this appears much less common among the broader masses of the people in Western countries.

In addition, serious scholars and academics are making excellent pushback; often assisted by grassroots social media and web activists.

For, even if such online phenomena often take a raw, emotive, and thus deeply ‘pre-reflective’ form, and often strays thereby into senseless hatemongering, the fact remains that the elite consensus of bourgeois multiculturalism and metropolitan diversity and ‘tolerance’ is under siege…

After a long honeymoon’s slumber.

Also, the current Occidental trajectory is towards populism, not elitism. Left wing and right populism are finally calling into question the eternality of the endless circle-jerk and mutual massage-orgy which assures regressive leftists that their virtue-signalling (i.e. saying things in order to sound ‘virtuous’ and ‘noble’) is actually worth the effort.

As the dividends for Islamic Exceptionalism dry up, i.e. the cynical exempting of Islam from the same high standards applied to other faiths and worldviews becomes a great deal less ‘lucrative’ in spiritual and material capital alike, social justice warriors will become figuratively homeless; if not literally also, in a few deeply unfortunate cases.

Finally, most Western countries do not have Islamic histories that are long in time, ancient in origin, or fundamentally constitutional of modern political and cultural and ideological consciousness (whether positively, or indeed negatively, as in the case of occupied Spain).

For all these reasons, it seems that there is indeed cause for cautious optimism that all is not lost in the Occident.

I have discussed several 'signs of life' in a Medium post on the 'reliberalization of Europe.'

How many such signs of life have you spotted?

Like the loose-tongued criminals and promiscuous traitors of ancient Greece who flew up into the heavens on wings made of waxen feathers, and who ended up breaking their necks when the wax melted; so also do the jihadists and Islamists risk heading for a fall.

Like the false prophet Simon Magus, who broke his neck after trying to contend with St Peter, the jihadists have been too arrogant. They are not only 'enthusiasts' in the sense John Locke speaks of: fanatics, fundamentalists, over-pious extremists guided by some wide-eyed vision.

In addition, they are also rather too 'enthusiastic' and greedy, in the usual sense of the word. For, unlike (say) Turkey or Pakistan, they have not been content to pursue a long march.

On the contrary! Outraged and despairing by the 'evil' they see around them, their flamboyant acts of provocation and of strident apologism and deflection and derailing, ultimately discredit them. The objective conditions are simply not right for them to achieve their goals.

For with some cunning and patience, they have achieved marvels elsewhere in the world; but nations that have tasted freedom for many centuries, if not millennia, have been less compliant than the cowards who have signed away their freedoms to Zia-ul-Haqq, or Ayatollah Khomeini, or other primitive, backward, reactionary barbarians.

They have been poking a sleeping giant for a little too long.

The Reliberalization of Europe is putting forth its first green shoots.

The UK Establishment must accept their own unqualified culpability for the slaughter and maiming of countless innocent civilians.

The recent appalling jihadist atrocity in Manchester, another heart-rending chapter of what the Mayor of London quite correctly characterizes as a tragic new normality to which Britons must become accustomed to, is a truly shocking and horrific event.

But it is not, for all that, remotely surprising.

I doubt that there is no enormity of terrorist brutality that can surprise anyone in the UK.

This is the Brave New World that our audaciously giddy Lords and Masters have decreed for us…

and their whirlpool, sadly, must also be ours.

The question must be asked:

Who is guilty of this utterly barbaric and wanton act of slaughter?

One answer easily springs to mind:

The repulsive jihadist cannibals who planned, plotted, and perpetrated the Manchester bombing.

This, of course, is beyond dispute.

However, while politicians try to distract you and me and our loved ones with their bread and circuses and manufactured outrage over the crimes of jihadists, it is worthwhile to bring to mind who else are directly culpable of this utterly unforgivable act of butchery.

BELLIGERENT UK POLITICIANS

First of all, the warmongering UK political establishment have been pursuing a ruthless, cold-blooded, chillingly reptilian policy of humanitarian aggression for decades. ‘Take up the White Man’s Burden’ remains the watchword, now and forevermore…

Given half a chance.

I have a target painted on my back.

And so do you.

And all do all your friends and family and loved ones in the UK.

And so does every single person in this country.

Who branded us with this mark of Cain?

I think you know.

And guess what?

I think I know too.

CRAVEN, QUIVERING INTCOM POLITICIANS

As Chomsky has aptly noted in his famous essay ‘The Crimes of IntCom,’ the so-called ‘International Community’ about which politicians sanctimoniously moralize, is really the Washington government and its ready collaborators. Chomsky has also noted that it is a ‘logical impossibility’ for the decree of the so-called ‘International Community’ to defy that of Washington.

Thus it is that the game is rigged, in favour of the most dangerous government on Earth.

UK foreign policy is complacently parasitical upon the DC death cult.

It is no surprised, also, that French collaboration knows no left or right. “Sarkollande” is the appalling two-headed monster, composed of the destroyer of Libya and the ‘peace prize winner’ who has wrought such wondrous works in the former French colony of Mali.

The enemies of civilization of every collaborating state must be blamed for the evil jihadist atrocity that has just been perpetrated; and not just the political Islamists themselves.

Let us also give a special mention to the most-favoured choppers, such as the Kingdom of Saudia Arabia; the Riyadh government has been funding dawah (proselytizing). This unspeakably treacherous agenda has had a devastating effect on Islam in the UK; British Islam has undergone a long twilight of Wahhabification.

This, as is clear to see, has had a catastrophic effect on people of all faiths and none; including (but not limited to) Muslims themselves.

THE THUGGISH WHITE NATIONALIST FAR RIGHT

Britain First, the BNP, the EDL, and other organizations of the non-theocratic strain of the far right, have consistently stirred up resentment among Muslims and non-Muslims alike. This only serves to feed conflict, and ultimately leads to the kind of chaos and devastation as we all have seen in Manchester.

The actions of the white nationalist far right are no more patriotic than those of Anjem Choudhary, the 7/7 bombers, or Tony Blair.

THE UNSCRUPULOUS ANTI-ISLAMOPHOBIA INDUSTRY (AIU)

The white nationalist far right claim terrorism has everything to do with Islam.

Similarly, the regressive left claim terrorism has nothing to do with Islam.

Both points of view are so extreme, irrational and hateful, that there is little point pedantically intellectualizing over which is worse.

The Lord’s Resistance Army.

The UVF and LVF.

Hamas, al-Qaeda, and the Islamic State.

Extremist monks in Sri Lanka and Myanmar.

Shall I go on?

THE FECKLESS ESTABLISHMENT MEDIA

It is unreasonable to tar all the UK or global media with the same brush.

However, for some reason, vast swathes of the media have both infected, and been infected by, some of the worst moral plague-bearers of all.

They also promote moral, cultural and historical relativism in various forms, undermine freedom of speech by victim-blaming those targeted by jihadists, and simplistically resort to one-sided and sentimental positions on the complex and highly sensitive Israel-Palestine dispute.

Needless to say, they also and sanctimoniously moralize about ‘Islamophobia’ instead of condemning both anti-Muslim bigots and regressive and authoritarian currents found in much of what passes for Islam today.

IRRESPONSIBLE INTELLIGENCE FUNDERS AND FREELOADERS

Now this is truly sickening.

Dragnet surveillance lets terrorists off the hook.

However, the intelligence personnel and governments at issue prefer to waste time and taxpayer’s money on mass surveillance, thereby endangering the lives of innumerable innocent people.

If any state or state intelligence body were to sudden start prioritizing saving lives, they would drop all mass surveillance, immediately, without a moment’s hesitation.

Believe it or not, they would also refrain from monitoring journalists and other non-dangerous figures.

Oh, imagine that! What an utterly scandalous suggestion!

But, let there be not the slightest sliver of doubt on this score.

If the willpower was there to save more lives, they undoubtedly could do it.

But political posturing and virtue-signalling means more to a lot of politicians and intelligence personnel, than actually safety.

Can you remember how many people have carried out terrorist atrocities in Europe who were actually supposed to be 'under surveillance,' but somehow the people in charge of such surveillance had 'better things to do with their time?'

I know I can't.

And I'm sure plenty of other people are in the same unfortunate situation as I am.

The fact is that intelligence and national security, or what passes for them, is a simply magnificent racket, and there is absolutely zero incentive whatsoever for politicians and intelligence top brass to cut the throat of the golden goose that is bringing them so much moral capital and material capital.

Are you angry about this?

You should be!

You should be so furious, you are practically unable to breathe.

If you aren’t, then I can only say:

Look around you.

Look at Manchester.

This is what ‘the Good Guys’ have wrought through their own negligence and evil deeds.

Every bit as much as ‘the Bad Guys.’

No more, no less.

Some people may be ‘offended’ by some or all of the foregoing.

I care more about truth than I do about political correctness and petit-bourgeois decency, civility and respectability.

There are others who do.

And we are awake, and we see everything that is happening today.

My dream is that one day, the UK’s slide into authoritarian barbarism will be halted by entirely peaceful and democratic means.

But until that day, you can be sure that if you are a humanitarian bomber, an AIU shill or a white nationalist race-baiter, you need to think about how far you can legitimately distance yourself from the repulsive jihadist scum who were the closest and most direct perpetrators of this evil act of indiscriminate murder.

It doesn’t matter what I think.

The UK Establishment must accept their own unqualified culpability for the slaughter and maiming of countless innocent civilians.

The recent appalling jihadist atrocity in Manchester, another heart-rending chapter of what the Mayor of London quite correctly characterizes as a tragic new normality to which Britons must become accustomed to, is a truly shocking and horrific event.

But it is not, for all that, remotely surprising.

I doubt that there is no enormity of terrorist brutality that can surprise anyone in the UK.

This is the Brave New World that our audaciously giddy Lords and Masters have decreed for us…

and their whirlpool, sadly, must also be ours.

The question must be asked:

Who is guilty of this utterly barbaric and wanton act of slaughter?

One answer easily springs to mind:

The repulsive jihadist cannibals who planned, plotted, and perpetrated the Manchester bombing.

This, of course, is beyond dispute.

However, while politicians try to distract you and me and our loved ones with their bread and circuses and manufactured outrage over the crimes of jihadists, it is worthwhile to bring to mind who else are directly culpable of this utterly unforgivable act of butchery.

BELLIGERENT UK POLITICIANS

First of all, the warmongering UK political establishment have been pursuing a ruthless, cold-blooded, chillingly reptilian policy of humanitarian aggression for decades. ‘Take up the White Man’s Burden’ remains the watchword, now and forevermore…

Given half a chance.

I have a target painted on my back.

And so do you.

And all do all your friends and family and loved ones in the UK.

And so does every single person in this country.

Who branded us with this mark of Cain?

I think you know.

And guess what?

I think I know too.

CRAVEN, QUIVERING INTCOM POLITICIANS

As Chomsky has aptly noted in his famous essay ‘The Crimes of IntCom,’ the so-called ‘International Community’ about which politicians sanctimoniously moralize, is really the Washington government and its ready collaborators. Chomsky has also noted that it is a ‘logical impossibility’ for the decree of the so-called ‘International Community’ to defy that of Washington.

Thus it is that the game is rigged, in favour of the most dangerous government on Earth.

UK foreign policy is complacently parasitical upon the DC death cult.

It is no surprised, also, that French collaboration knows no left or right. “Sarkollande” is the appalling two-headed monster, composed of the destroyer of Libya and the ‘peace prize winner’ who has wrought such wondrous works in the former French colony of Mali.

The enemies of civilization of every collaborating state must be blamed for the evil jihadist atrocity that has just been perpetrated; and not just the political Islamists themselves.

Let us also give a special mention to the most-favoured choppers, such as the Kingdom of Saudia Arabia; the Riyadh government has been funding dawah (proselytizing). This unspeakably treacherous agenda has had a devastating effect on Islam in the UK; British Islam has undergone a long twilight of Wahhabification.

This, as is clear to see, has had a catastrophic effect on people of all faiths and none; including (but not limited to) Muslims themselves.

THE THUGGISH WHITE NATIONALIST FAR RIGHT

Britain First, the BNP, the EDL, and other organizations of the non-theocratic strain of the far right, have consistently stirred up resentment among Muslims and non-Muslims alike. This only serves to feed conflict, and ultimately leads to the kind of chaos and devastation as we all have seen in Manchester.

The actions of the white nationalist far right are no more patriotic than those of Anjem Choudhary, the 7/7 bombers, or Tony Blair.

THE UNSCRUPULOUS ANTI-ISLAMOPHOBIA INDUSTRY (AIU)

The white nationalist far right claim terrorism has everything to do with Islam.

Similarly, the regressive left claim terrorism has nothing to do with Islam.

Both points of view are so extreme, irrational and hateful, that there is little point pedantically intellectualizing over which is worse.

© REUTERS/ Toby Melville Does Terrorism Change Election Results?

Terrorism may ‘have no religion,’ as the politically correct old saw goes, but terrorists generally do.

The Lord’s Resistance Army.

The UVF and LVF.

Hamas, al-Qaeda, and the Islamic State.

Extremist monks in Sri Lanka and Myanmar.

Shall I go on?

THE FECKLESS ESTABLISHMENT MEDIA

It is unreasonable to tar all the UK or global media with the same brush.

However, for some reason, vast swathes of the media have both infected, and been infected by, some of the worst moral plague-bearers of all.

The hard-right red tops, or Right-SJW media, practice shameless race-baiting, race-hustling and ‘white identity politics,’ stirring up hatred against asylum seekers, Muslims, and members of ethnic minorities.

Meanwhile, myriad privileged metropolitan regressive-leftist intellectuals of the Left-SJW media consistently downplay the crucial role religious ideas and motivations play in underlying violent jihad.

1. Ferrying Migrants into Europe’s Heartland:

NATO’s ships could stop the migrant flows in a heartbeat. Instead, the Alliance’s vessels are a vital link in bridging the Mediterranean, outdoing even the human traffickers. Ironically, maritime and human rights laws are used to justify positioning nearly a million young men of fighting age across the EU.

2. Failing to Stem the Tide of Terrorism:

Free movement across EU borders allows drugs, arms, human traffickers and ‘bad dudes’ to hide among the refugee influx. Instead of freedom and unity, European citizens face a permanent state of emergency that cruelly erodes their civil liberties while leaving them exposed to increased risk.

3. Subverting National Democracy:

© AP Photo/ Mindaugas Kulbis No Reason to Return to Arms Race Even Amid Possible Escalation in Europe - Russian Foreign Ministry

The EU-NATO Axis sees Brexit as a threat, Russia as a threat, and has now labeled President Trump an existential threat . While the bloc is able to flexibly co-opt almost any ideology from Conservative, Eurosocialist, Fascist, Trotskyite, Environmentalist, LGBT, into its expansionist agenda- it scorns sovereign democracy as both a menace to its internal integrity and the armed front against Russia.

4. Population Replacement:

The EU-NATO Axis has no use for genuine patriots who might question both its methods and their goals. Its primary need is cheap manpower to artificially maintain economic growth regardless of the social cost. Like it or not, in the key demographic of 18-30, mass immigration is de facto population replacement.

Even vulnerable societies in the Baltic are not to be spared, while Ukraine presents a vast opportunity for the resettlement of tens of millions of migrants from the Middle East.

This new eastern empire is to be ruled by a multicultural Germany and settled not by Germanic soldier-farmers as envisaged by Himmler- but instead by male migrants imported from the most blighted corners of the earth.

The EU-NATO Axis envisages a new ethnic compound to bind their eastern conquests composed of migrant men and Slav women. It’s a continuation of Germany’s drive to the east that began with the Teutonic Knights, that culminated in the horrors of the Third Reich, and which now seeks to finally conquer the Slav world for good. The EU-NATO Axis has weaponized population decline for geopolitical leverage.

5. Neocolonialist Expansion:

Like Hitler’s plans to build an empire in the East and Napoleon’s dream of conquering the Orient, the EU-NATO Axis seeks to expand into both Ukraine and North Africa.

These expansionist goals are driven by the elites who want extractive resources, strategic depth, living space and absolute suzerainty over newly assimilated lands.

Of course, this is dressed up as the promotion of ‘civil society’ and ‘colored revolution’ to give a veneer to the looting of nations and the suppression of local resistance. It’s a policy that has knowingly promoted the worst kind of militancy from Kiev to Cairo.

6. Propaganda and Ideology:

The aims of the EU-NATO Axis are so radical, so likely to fuel extremism and so paranoid- that only a sophisticated propaganda infrastructure is ever likely to thwart potential resistance to its dual erosion of the nation state and western identity.

Using the soft totalitarianism of ‘moral blackmail,’ the EU-NATO Axis inspires the liberal MSM to use cry bully tactics to suppress legitimate opposition while cynically stoking cuckold leftist street mobs to rise to its defence.

The MSM, including state broadcasters, are simply the globalist propaganda wings of Brussels where both the EU and NATO are headquartered.

7. Revolution:

Far beyond anything it has ever done before in terms of victimizing western citizens, the EU-NATO Axis and its bipartisan allies in the United States are rallying to provoke conflict with Russia in a dogged effort to delegitimize President Trump.

As the contagion of civil disorder linked to modest immigration reform metastasizes across America, NATO troops are massing on Russia’s borders even as pro-EU militias under orders from Kiev and John McCain have begun shelling the Donbass in violation of the Minsk ceasefire agreements.

In a sign that Theresa May could well be double dealing against President Trump, a British Type 45 Destroyer, HMS Diamond, is moving towards Ukraine even as the fighting, in fulfillment of McCain’s New Year vow to confront Russia, worsens with each hour.

The EU-NATO Axis is no conspiracy theory: It’s hiding in plain sight. If left unchallenged, it will rip to shreds the very fabric of western civilization.

One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them. One Ring to bring them all- and in the darkness bind them.

No one ever truly believed that American democracy was perfect. But the sabotaging of the transition period and the fissuring of the US intelligence community are the outcomes of a scorched-earth policy spawned from a deadender mentality that simply refuses to defer to democratic values. Such nihilism inexorably messages America’s bloody history of four lethal presidential assassinations between 1865 and 1963.

Arguably, the armed lone fantasist, hopelessly lost in a world inundated with the victim politics of the liberal elite and where fragile self-worth is tallied up by the number of facebook likes has never had a greater incentive to seek not just personal redemption- but the superstar fame of committing what any sane society would consider unthinkable.

And yet by slow degrees and at a subliminal level, the respect for democratic institutions and the values that maintain them are being recklessly eroded to the point where, in the eye of the warped extremist mind at least,- the heinous becomes not only possible, but desirable.

Needless to say, Marcus Junius Brutus, a respected senator, who initiated Caesar’s murder in 44 BC, believed he was acting to save the Roman Republic. Likewise, Abraham Lincoln’s assassin, John Wilkes Booth, reckoned enfranchising the South’s former slaves threatened society and that the only way to prove white lives mattered meant pulling out a gun.

For Lee Harvey Oswald, President Kennedy’s killer, the motives, while nebulous, are perhaps even more nightmarish than some tidy political aim that didn’t plumb the depths of human frailty while breeding a thousand competing conspiracy theories: The 1964 Warren Commission Report suggested that Oswald, a 24-year-old ex-marine and former defector to the Soviet Union, was a social misfit with a grudge against authority.

Moreover, the Report also concluded that Oswald’s ‘Marxism for Dummies’ approach to Communist dialectic had alienated him from not just the Soviet Union, but from his homeland and probably anywhere else he was ever likely to go.

Unyielding arrogance, mental instability, violent narcissism, social rejection- a miasma of broiling factors that lurk behind the outwardly normal façade of the would-be presidential assassin may lie dormant if not activated by a sly political narrative that lauds the act of atrocity as potentially meritorious.

While the budding assassin might be sane enough to realize his or her actions might not be immediately extolled, the fact that they can at least be understood is the first step to self justification in the kind of tortured soul that does double duty as the court of history: Such malign pathologies are sure to be drawn to the hysterical debate that rejects Mr. Trump as a ‘ Russian stooge ’ the way a moth is slowly drawn to a flame.

Still, as with any serial killer, gruesome notoriety is its own reward- though today’s toxic political climate is likely to appeal to those seeking much wider validation than that offered by some obscure subculture: For the kind of deranged fanatic likely to be motivated to go after President Trump, it’s enough that his-her actions will be pondered by liberal professors in the best universities, analyzed by the mainstream media, and duly declared as justified by whatever fringe groups latch on to the same kind of sick moral relativism that equated 911 with American foreign policy in the developing world.

Moral Depravity

The cruel, self debilitating truth is that it will be all too easy to find liberal intellectuals in America willing to compare President Trump’s assassin to Georg Elser- the humble carpenter who planted a bomb in the Burgerbraukeller in the 1939 plot to kill Adolf Hitler.

© AFP 2017/ PAUL J. RICHARDS Here's How the Trump Presidency Will Play Out

The bipartisan elite’s stubborn strategy of Russophobia and its enabling media frenzy surrounding Mr. Trump’s fully democratic victory, if not directly targeting unstable minds with the precision of a reaper drone, is nevertheless fueling the kind of social instability that might tip those of a certain pathology over the edge: It’s all too easy to imagine that some lone assassin might lunge forth not only armed with a gun- but with the delusional view that President Trump was installed by the Russians, that he is about to declare genocide in the Middle East, or that, in the quasi-religious terms of the Left- he represents the victory of hate over hope.

Indeed, the elite’s incessant rhetoric and its sanctimonious grandstanding is of such virulence that apart from leftist fanatics and lone crazies- the grim possibility that a mole might emerge among the Secret Service, someone who sees himself as a Von Stauffenberg type figure, motivated by a desire to save America from ‘the Kremlin’s candidate’ can no longer be dismissed: the Brutus complex in its purest and most lethal form.

As the now thoroughly politicized deep state fractures in the manner of some banana republic’s security regime and the tentacles of the US political establishment flail out to the EU-NATO Axis in their attempts to subvert the constitution, the risible message is being sent on all levels that President Trump is both grotesquely illegitimate and that he is, as one CNN opinion piece has put it today- ‘preparing to surrender America’s interests to Russia.’

Accordingly, as a result of this crafty policy of strategic incitement to civil disorder, an anarchist group known only as Disrupt-J20 is planning to attack Thursday’s planned ‘Deploraball’ at the National Press Club with acid filtered into the sprinkler system. Unsurprisingly, the 900,000 expected in Washington for the inauguration are sure to include a motley collection of radicals hell-bent on trouble. That these useful idiots of that same Deep State that lied to them on Iraq have been conditioned into believing they are ‘acting against the imperialist establishment’ underscores their stupidity as well as their sniveling sense of moral justification.

Willing Victims of Globalist Incitement

From last night’s lone protester trying to set himself on fire outside Trump Tower to the 200,000 man ‘March on Washington’ planned for just hours after the presidential inauguration, the elites are mobilizing the power of the street fist- methods identical to colored revolution exported by the EU-NATO Axis and the CIA into the Russian geo-cultural sphere and which have employed fascist methods to subvert democracy. Is this what a deep state coup d’état looks like when initiated not in Kiev, but in Washington itself?

Tellingly, the corporate liberal media, while nominally touting the Left’s agenda, is slyly angling for McCain’s deep state neocon faction as it destabilizes American democracy. At no point has this project to erode public faith in the American constitution and the presidency ever acknowledged, even for a second, that its incendiary efforts pose legal culpability and that the madman who cries ‘fire’ in a crowded theater is legally responsible for the chaos that ensues.

In their efforts to ensure Brutus not only feels vindicated- but that he has his audience, the mainstream media and the controlling elitist cartels are no doubt relying on the multiple degrees of separation between them and any potential assassin: Should the unthinkable happen, god forbid, that’s not a view that will be shared by the American people who will undoubtedly demand a day of reckoning.

Indeed, the elite’s incessant rhetoric and its sanctimonious grandstanding is of such virulence that apart from leftist fanatics and lone crazies- the grim possibility that a mole might emerge among the Secret Service, someone who sees himself as a Von Stauffenberg type figure, motivated by a desire to save America from ‘the Kremlin’s candidate’ can no longer be dismissed: the Brutus complex in its purest and most lethal form.

As the now thoroughly politicized deep state fractures in the manner of some banana republic’s security regime and the tentacles of the US political establishment flail out to the EU-NATO Axis in their attempts to subvert the constitution, the risible message is being sent on all levels that President Trump is both grotesquely illegitimate and that he is, as one CNN opinion piece has put it today- ‘preparing to surrender America’s interests to Russia.’

Accordingly, as a result of this crafty policy of strategic incitement to civil disorder, an anarchist group known only as Disrupt-J20 is planning to attack Thursday’s planned ‘Deploraball’ at the National Press Club with acid filtered into the sprinkler system. Unsurprisingly, the 900,000 expected in Washington for the inauguration are sure to include a motley collection of radicals hell-bent on trouble. That these useful idiots of that same Deep State that lied to them on Iraq have been conditioned into believing they are ‘acting against the imperialist establishment’ underscores their stupidity as well as their sniveling sense of moral justification.

Willing Victims of Globalist Incitement

From last night’s lone protester trying to set himself on fire outside Trump Tower to the 200,000 man ‘March on Washington’ planned for just hours after the presidential inauguration, the elites are mobilizing the power of the street fist- methods identical to colored revolution exported by the EU-NATO Axis and the CIA into the Russian geo-cultural sphere and which have employed fascist methods to subvert democracy. Is this what a deep state coup d’état looks like when initiated not in Kiev, but in Washington itself?

Tellingly, the corporate liberal media, while nominally touting the Left’s agenda, is slyly angling for McCain’s deep state neocon faction as it destabilizes American democracy. At no point has this project to erode public faith in the American constitution and the presidency ever acknowledged, even for a second, that its incendiary efforts pose legal culpability and that the madman who cries ‘fire’ in a crowded theater is legally responsible for the chaos that ensues.

In their efforts to ensure Brutus not only feels vindicated- but that he has his audience, the mainstream media and the controlling elitist cartels are no doubt relying on the multiple degrees of separation between them and any potential assassin: Should the unthinkable happen, god forbid, that’s not a view that will be shared by the American people who will undoubtedly demand a day of reckoning.

But Ukraine remains the planned political death blow.

The fingerprints of both dissident Republicans and diehard Clintonites have led to a former SIS agent turning gun-for hire in a plot that could have come straight out of some tawdry spy thriller. While John McCain was the first to receive the one-time British agent’s findings, the initiative to employ the supposed MI6 officer turned freewheeler came from Senator Harry Reid who seems to have a fondness for fake news and all who tout it:

Is it really possible that such a person is committed to America’s interests abroad and democratic institutions at home?

Far away in time and space from the plush Ritz Carlton hotel where, so this implausible story goes, the President-elect once engaged in a series of sordid acts under the watchful eye of Russia’s security services , Senator John McCain (R-AZ) used New Year to tour the Ukrainian frontline in a bloody-minded show of defiance to the Trumpist revolution.

Indeed, the Ritz Carlton and Pissgate are just a brief stopover before the ultimate destination: Trump’s removal from office justified on the basis of an upsurge in violence in Ukraine. Could a sleazy Manchurian ever be relied upon to confront the Russian bear when the FSB had Pissgate’s tapes in their pocket?

To deconstruct the entire Pissgate narrative, it’s not only necessary to track down the MI6 link in this great chain of grubby fakery- it’s vital to understand the kaleidoscope of ideas and interests that made Pissgate possible. And that takes us to Ukraine- where the grand finale will be played out.

While the rest of the world prayed for a peaceful New Year, relentless John McCain mischievously pitched up in the village of Shirokino, near Mariupol, where he duly exhorted Kiev’s militias to fight against Vladimir Putin with the fiery assurance that: ‘in 2017 we will defeat the invaders and send them back to where they came from.’ In the cold mud of a charred pro-government village, a bloodcurdling show of alpha male bonding unfolded as President Petro Poroshenko proudly presented Senator McCain with his New Year’s gift: a domestically manufactured Ukrainian assault rifle.

If Kiev’s fighters weren’t visibly displaying SS insignia on their helmets, and had been scrubbed clean of their Nazi armbands and tattoos, that’s probably only because McCain had been burned before- from posing with armed fanatics in the Middle East to supporting the World Anti-Communist League whose leader was inevitably outed as a Nazi sympathizer.

Having personally donated money to the Contras, a band of savages known for slaughtering both peasants and priests alike, Shirokino wasn’t perhaps such an unlikely destination for McCain- even in the season of goodwill. In any case, he made no effort to sanitize the reckless nature of his plans- quite the contrary: both McCain and Senator Lindsay are relying on as much publicity as they can get for their scheme to bring mayhem to a region still struggling to recover from years of brutal fighting.

Although no clearer intention to set the Donbass Conflict Zone ablaze could have possibly been stated, McCain’s travelling companion, Senator Lindsay Graham (R-SC), eagerly chimed: ‘So 2017 is a year of offence and we’re going to tell our colleagues what’s at stake.’

That this is an astounding display of cold war bluster that jeopardizes Ukrainian lives is rivaled only by the obvious fact that the spurious claims the senators have made that ‘Ukraine’s war is America’s war’ is one that American citizens themselves would no doubt strongly dispute given Trump’s victory on a ticket that clearly focused on salvaging relations with the Russian Federation after Obama’s grotesque mismanaging of foreign policy in almost every theater.

King of Clubs

John McCain, a failed presidential candidate, is out to take Trump down and if Ukraine can be used as a platform to achieve this, then regardless of the cost to life and limb- so be it. While some might hanker after any evidence that McCain’s sojourn in the Hanoi Hilton provides proof of the senator’s moral rectitude, even a cursory glance at McCain’s career shows that the 80-year old is a cunning opportunist obsessed with becoming President of the United States- even though Americans have spurned him not once, but twice.

Indeed, that Donald Trump, who never served in Vietnam, who was more concerned with running his businesses than either whitewashing the Contras, pulling out of the 1972 ABM Treaty , stitching up Iraq on WMDs, or otherwise violently intervening abroad- will be the 45th President of the United States must be something that utterly galls McCain: It is the ultimate insult to a patrician politician like McCain whose military credentials are impressive.

Having made winning the presidency look so easy, McCain will now go to any lengths to ensure that Trump is taught a salutary lesson in humility. Not only that, Trump needed to be thoroughly shamed in a way that only Pissgate’s loathsome revelations could ever achieve. If Pissgate proves anything, it is that the GOP establishment and the Democrats have merged into a single insurgent faction that Trump’s wafer thin support base will find all but impossible to contain. If the plan is not some military coup as was scandalously touted by the LA times- it most certainly is to plunge the Trump presidency into an early tailspin. Pissgate was contrived to mingle suspicion with disgust and while it can’t cripple Trump in itself, it’s a stabbing cut at his public persona.

CC BY 2.0 / Marcin Wichary / Russian hacker bear Romanian Hacker, RT and Internet 'Trolls': US Intel Report on 'Russian Hacking' Lacks Evidence and Credibility , Pissgate sets the scene for personal perversion to blur with later military incompetence- the tried and tested tactics of the Trotskyite rubric. Needless to say, those who conjured up Pissgate are intimately familiar with Russian history, professional Russophobes eking out their time lobbying for the arms industry in the ideological bloodlands between neoconservatism and neoliberal interventionism.

What augurs now is the dystopian nightmare of a constitutional crisis on the Hill whose tangled roots will lie in Ukraine, the Baltic, Georgia, or possibly the Middle East. Ukraine, however, is by far the preferred option and exactly the place where McCain, who infamously stoked the fires of rebellion on Kiev’s Maydan in 2014, feels most ideologically at ease and indeed, most valued by the unruly natives.

McCain’s sullen strength lies in the bipartisan appeal of his machinations. Make no mistake, neoconservatives and neoliberals differ only on minor ideological nuances and who personally gets to divide up the winnings: On foreign policy issues, their aims and their methods reinforce each other. It’s no accident that neocon hawks like Robert Kagan defected to Clinton, or that McCain, and Lindsay Graham even more so- both flirt with liberal issues on a whim.

The deeper ideological cement that unites all factions now gunning for Trump is a globalist hatred of sovereign democracy and the Russian Federation which, according to this worldview, thwart American hegemony. What American hegemony means in both theory and practice differs between factions, just as World Socialism had various interpretations among the 20th century’s various communist sects: from militarily imposed US global leadership for democracy in the minds of neocons like McCain to an almost Trotskyite internationalism according to President Obama’s canon- globalist goals vary only in the manner of their propaganda packaging, rather than their outcomes. From Serbia to Libya, it’s a blood-spattered lesson Poroshenko ought to have borne in mind had he any residue of compassion for his long-suffering people.

When McCain and Lindsay declared 2017 as the year ‘they go on the offensive’- they absolutely need to be taken seriously. If Poroshenko is oblivious to the carnage McCain’s warmongering is sure to cause, neither Trump nor President Putin have that luxury. For the former, it represents a laser-like challenge to his political survival, while for the latter it means the rekindling of a conflict Russia has worked hard to contain.

Of course, it’s President Trump who has the most to lose. McCain and his bipartisan insurgents would be more than happy to oust Trump on the basis of the Trump University fiasco, or lawsuits initiated by the dozens of women who have accused Trump of sexual assault : But that simply isn’t going to happen. And yet the salacious vector was just too good to abandon entirely- Pissgate merely being the international version.

Awful though Pissgate is, an infinitely stronger pesticide is needed and McCain, allied to the Left, will instead rely on the time-honored strategy of chaos that has worked ever since it overthrew Tsar Nicholas exactly 100 years ago: an event that in similar fashion fused British spies with rumours of sexual impropriety to initiate radical change.

America’s October Revolution

Like Tsar Nicholas, who was falsely accused of being a German agent, a key vector in taking down President Trump is the accusation that he is a Kremlin stooge. Yet the potential of that accusation to inflict long-lasting damage upon Trump is now fast waning, with even Rolling Stone smelling a rat and McCain’s tedious senate hearing on cyber security able to generate only diminishing returns. The Russian hacking hoax is however only the opening salvo in a go-for-broke strategy meant to secure Trump’s ultimate removal: It’s the first act of a political coup against Trump that will be firmly rooted, just like the October Revolution, in the blood, guts, and incompetent response to great power conflict. The intersection between Ukraine and the hacking hoax couldn’t in fact be any clearer.

Pissgate’s crude imperative is to throw everything into sharp relief.

And what of Poroshenko? Like Saakashvili in 2008, he can easily be relied upon to play his role by instigating armed conflict. At some point in 2017, Kiev’s thunderous artillery may well open up on the Luhansk People’s Republic as Poroshenko moves to fulfill his Faustian pact with McCain. It’s at this sorry point, where innocent Ukrainians of all ethnicities are being torn to shreds by indiscriminate artillery barrages, that McCain will get the leverage over Trump he so desperately needs. Remember again:‘2017 is a year of offence and we’re going to tell our colleagues what’s at stake if we don’t push back.’ Pissgate is there to ensure that when the crisis explodes onto our screens, the American public can be assured that the man they elected is to be mistrusted at every turn.

The American people now have the cards stacked against them. It’s the same in Europe where McCain, who laughably condemned Brexit as an opportunity for President Putin to unravel the West, lures Kiev into the folly of conflict with Russia via not just the promise of lethal arms, but the far more dangerous promise of EU membership.

McCain and his fellow globalists on the neoliberal faction of the movement absolutely rely on the EU to enable their ideas.

Still, it’s a far off cry from accusing Trump of ‘being soft on Russia,’ even in a time of regional conflict in Ukraine, to actually getting him either impeached.

But think again: the liberal media will shamelessly force-feed atrocity pictures of casualties from McCain’s timely little war that will render Trump seemingly impotent even as they amplify earlier allegations that originated in the hacking hoax.

However, it’s immigration reform that will incite the masses to violence and public disorder. In short, as any Trotskyite theoretician would be the first to acknowledge, foreign conflict must fuse with domestic chaos to achieve the desired result.

Pissgate aside, while it might be hard to imagine snowflakes and BLM swarming onto the streets in support of John McCain- so long as globalist ends are served, the details don’t matter. But even here a word of caution is needed: John McCain is Chairman of the International Republican Institute (IRI) whose work is linked both to George Soros, the US State Department and has included, among other things, training activists for the Arab Spring, a coup in Haiti, and organizing right wingers in Poland.

The IRI embodies the bipartisan nature of the globalist agenda and the fact that it will employ anyone from Kiev’s Neo-Nazis to labour activists and gender equality campaigners as and when needed. That McCain and Soros would be able to collude at different ends of the globalist spectrum in order to incite civil unrest in the United States is a dead certainty. Needless to say, the IRI is banned on the territory of the Russian Federation for the kind of reasons American patriots may soon discover at first hand.

As we enter 2017, is there any hope? The problem is that Trump is leading a national revolution for American freedom without having had the time, or perhaps even the inclination, to develop a disciplined support base for his policies. Instead of commanding a dedicated cadre of revolutionaries, he is sitting on the point of the GOP needle, wholly reliant on protest votes to counter, hopefully, senatorial resentment at being so comprehensively upstaged.

© REUTERS/ Shannon Stapleton More Plans for Nigel? Farage Sets Foot in Trump Tower Again

Farage understood that protest votes were ephemeral and that’s why he quit when he was ahead. Trump, by contrast, is trapped by those same protest votes that commit him to implementing his promises- without being able to rely on them when McCain and the liberal establishment make their move. Perhaps, McCain, too old and discredited to ever be President now, sees himself as a Von Hindenburg type figure, stepping in to save his country from Trumpist perdition. Or perhaps he’s just a sore loser who can’t get over his hatred of Russia. Certainly, as Pissgate shows, Russia is at the center of his fantasies.

Either way, if Trump is to fend off the globalist plot against American democracy, not only must he avoid being baited into ‘standing up to Vladimir Putin’- he must move his ideological agenda as far from the so-called Alt-Right as he can get. He has talented people on his side, the delightfully vivacious KT McFarland, for example, whose Weinberger Doctrine on US military intervention could reign in McCain and his ilk. Newt Gingrich’s Contract with America provides another example of the kind of inclusive proactive policy push Trump now needs to find if he is to resist McCain and Pissgate’s assorted deep state putschists.

Above all, as the West faces civilizational collapse, just as the barbarians flocked to feast on Rome’s carcass in the 5th century, today’s angry third world multitudes are massing at the cry of their globalist enablers to devour the innards of our societies. In such a perilous time, with the mass extinction of western civilization imminent, provoking unnecessary conflict with Russia is no act of American patriotism.

And yet this is just one battlefield in what all are agreed is the Great Cyber War of 2017.

© AFP 2017/ CLEMENS BILAN Dozens of Sex Attacks Registered in Berlin Despite 'Tough' Security Measures

In a disturbing new twist to the EU’s burgeoning epidemic of migrant sex attacks, a powerful network of pro-NATO think tanks dedicated to launching ‘total war’ against Russia are scrambling an army of cyber spooks in a frantic bid to play down the upsurge in migrant-related crime over the New Year.

Cold war hawks from think tanks including the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) and the Legatum Institute have opened up a new front in their longstanding information war against both Russia and euroskeptics: the categorization of media reports on migrant criminality as a combination of ‘fake news’ and ‘far-right xenophobia.’

High Stakes

The think tanks, the nervous system of a network of lobbyists that links the eurocrats with Washington, are funded by the titans of the US arms and energy industries. The avowed mission of these policy advocates is to preserve the EU, regardless of the social cost, as a market for US defence contractors and LNG suppliers. The system is underpinned not only by political alliances between US neocons and democrats and their counterparts in NATO’s capitals- but by an intricate web of personal contacts built up since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the voluntary retreat of the Soviet Union from Eastern Europe.

Polish-American top Project Fear strategist Anne Applebaum, a Pulitzer prize-winning historian and aficionado of the totalitarian era, is a leading influence within the Warsaw-based CEPA think tank. Ms. Applebaum has built her entire literary career upon blurring the boundaries between the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation.

In similar fashion, Brexit , and now the Trump victory, are no outpouring of grassroots democracy, according to her narrative, but sinister international conspiracies against the established world order that must be smashed. For Anne Applebaum, innocent popular democracy is nothing but an extended metaphor for counterrevolutionary subversion. Needless to say, that’s the very thing she’s been trying to export to Russia for the last 15 years.

Chillingly, Ms. Applebaum, whose bunker mentality reflects that of the beleaguered communist leaders in the last days of the Warsaw Pact that she is so fascinated with as a historian, views truth as a commodity that is wholly conditioned by ideology. Thusly, UKIP are what she has branded “a strange coalition of cranks, cheats, and open racists.”

In September 2016, Applebaum, formerly one of the most respected authorities on the Cold War tweeted: “UKIP is now the functional equivalent of the Soviet era British Communist Party. It promotes foreign despotism.” In an ideological contortion act, while slamming simple British patriots seeking only to recover a modicum of self determination, Applebaum is an ardent supporter of Ukraine’s ultra-nationalists.

NATO’S Wicked Witch of Eastern Europe

If Ms. Applebaum’s mindset is more Erich Honecker than Ronald Reagan as she confronts the rising tide of people power in the EU, there is an infinitely darker rubric at hand than anything represented by the benign Warsaw Pact: Lifting the concept straight out of Goebbels’ infamous 1943 Sportpalast speech, Applebaum, in August 2014, called for ‘total war’ against Russia in an article written for her home paper- the Washington Post.

But what would total war against Russia look like? One where Warsaw might get the chance to use those patriot missiles Applebaum’s own husband, the former Polish foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski, brought to Poland years before tensions flared in Ukraine?

Do you want Total War?

Applebaum’s threat of total war shows that the Crimean crisis was the pretext the EU-NATO Axis’ ideologues had been searching for all along. Their aim is not simply to preserve the EU- it is to negate Russian sovereign democracy. This is why being a euroskeptic while remaining pro-NATO is untenable. It’s a cruel contradiction.

NATO is not a force for regional stability- how can it be when Applebaum and the ideologues around her from Clinton to McCain hold these delusional, hegemonic views?

For the record, as Ms. Applebaum knows, Russia has faced military aggression on many previous occasions. As in the past, the response would be decisive. This video is about the Battle of Kursk, the largest tank battle of all time. It’s a slight cinematic glimpse into total war- but the reality is something even Anne Applebaum, for all her gentle research, is unable to imagine.

Is pushing the world to this through such violent language, military posturing, and disregard for sovereign rights what the EU means by an ‘eastern partnership?’ Do the warmongering views being touted without any real pushback of the type that was commonplace in the 70s during detente make us in Western Europe, who have no legitimate quarrel with Russia, safe or unsafe? Of course, the answer is obvious.

It’s at this point that the humble euroskeptic begins to realize that the coercive machinery of political correctness is based on preserving the geopolitical basis of the EU-NATO Axis, rather than any deference to liberal humanism. After all, where is the humanism in total war against Russia? Where is the humanism in airbrushing the mass rape of women from Sweden to Bavaria?

Thusly, both Brexit and the Trump campaign have been marred by accusations that they have led to an uptick in hate crime. It’s interesting to note that Anne Applebaum enjoys unique access to the Polish Embassy in London- which was a center of post-Brexit outrage- just as she does with the Washington Post which was the first to run claims that the Vermont power grid had been subject to ‘Russian hacking.’

And yet, in both cases, these hyper-partisan accusations were found to be demonstrably false: In the UK, the BBC is slowly being forced to concede that the tragic murder of a Polish man, Arkadiusz Jozwik, by a 15-year-old punk in Essex was not somehow inspired by Brexit.

Equally, the Washington Post’s so called ‘Russian cyber hack’ of a Vermont utilities provider was in reality nothing of the kind. If Ms. Applebaum, a vociferous Clintonite, is only an irrelevant circumstantial link between these two episodes of unfettered information warfare- the mentalities that conjured up these fake stories exist on a single vector- as do their reactionary political objectives.

While sniveling that she has been the victim of ‘a Russian smear campaign’ Ms. Applebaum has had no compunction in agitating against democracy on both sides of the Atlantic: In the UK, she has, quite laughably, targeted the Daily Mail as ‘a newspaper that propagates the ideas of the Populist International.’

From there it’s just a short step to the criminalization of euroskeptic ideas- even in the British mainstream media. As in the United States, this can be achieved through accusations of hate crime, treason, and sympathy with what Applebaum calls the Popular International- all show trialed by the liberal mainstream media . None of this can be justified by what Applebaum and her fellow experts in Soviet history in the think tanks refer to as ‘defending European values.’ Is it any accident that Anna Fotyga, who seeks to suppress RT for its unbiased reporting on euroskeptic issues, is a close friend of Anne Applebaum? Let’s call them the Warsaw set for convenience.

The reporting of migrant sex attacks is now a political act. It is an act of resistance. Superficially, the culprit is political correctness but that is merely the outer layer of the onion- meant to mobilize leftist street support in defence of the EU and a rationale for local police chiefs to both suppress the news and advance their own careers in a way that is, ironically, contrived to be morally uplifting.

Behind the PC veil lurk the deep state, the arms industry, the transatlantic political cartels, the energy moghuls, all of whom rely on the likes of CEPA and a plethora of other think tanks to shape public policy on anything from how migrant sex attacks should be reported, or not as the case may be, to how defending EU free movement is the only way to insulate the Polish economy from its crippling defence budget.

Working at the gritty end, the cyber trolls of EUvsDisinfo are busily claiming that an incident in Dortmund, where a 1,000-strong mob of migrants went on the rampage, never even took place. Merely mentioning the alleged rape of a girl in Muehdorf on social media was deemed a criminal offence by the Bavarian State Police. As in any totalitarian infrastructure, petty officials soon learn to comply with expectations- or as Russians say ‘the fish always rots from the top.’ The role of the EU-Atlantacist think tanks is to ensure that the fish putrefies in its absolute entirety and that the whole pond is irreversibly polluted.

And yet as 2017 unfolds, the truth is leaking out. And for the anti-Russian think tanks and their attendant cyber trolls- it’s the last thing they wish to hear. In a terrible irony, those neocon historians who have studied the horrors of the 20th century’s trampling of the individual are subconsciously resurrecting the dark arts of totalitarian manipulation as they erase the suffering of countless women while projecting their own inherent venality onto the Kremlin leadership.

In Innsbruck as the New Year bells chimed, dozens of women were sexually assaulted even as 90 policemen looked on. In Chemnitz a girl was ambushed. In Neumarkt, another young lady was attacked. In both Hamburg and Augsburg women reported numerous sex offences in Tahrir style crowd violence that singled out females. Meanwhile, in France, the europhile media maintained a stoic silence as over a thousand cars were torched.

Dirty Money?

Anne Applebaum takes those she can fool to the brink of a massive cultural showdown between the West and Russia- a lofty clash between Muscovy’s autocracy and the EU’s liberal values; but this is a mere prelude to her claim that all the Kremlin really wants is a safe haven for its money. For Applebaum, in the ultimate damp squib of a finale, Russia is finally revealed in her last act as nothing more than a petty kleptocracy. For someone who knows Russian history so well, it’s a flawed conclusion that could have only been reached through the deepest psychological projection of her own materialism. For years, rumors have swirled about Applebaum’s financial dealings and the unaccounted for $800,000 that appeared in her bank accounts for 2014.

If the ailing Schengen Zone is one thing, migrant mayhem in the militarily sensitive areas of Poland and the Baltic States are given special attention by the Pro-NATO think tanks with CEPA running a weekly rundown on euroskepticism in nations that are increasingly questioning the viability of the Faustian pact that sees them trading their traditional values for NATO’s protection from an imaginary Russian threat. Like the STASI, or the SECURITATE, CEPA monitors the pulse beat of public opinion- as does EUvsDisinfo. Tellingly, CEPA’s reports on migrant sex crimes on NATO’s Eastern Flanks, which are always airbrushed as ‘Russian disinformation,’ are coldly filed under ‘

And that is precisely how the EU’s leading Russophobes including Edward Lucas, Ben Nimmo, Peter Pomerantsev, Ben Judah, Mark Galeotti, and Anne Applebaum see the reporting of migrant criminality: not as a human tragedy, that of the needless suffering of the innocent individual, but as a mere radar blip on the battleboard of total war against the Russian Federation. And if nothing else convinces you in all of this that the EU-NATO Axis is already on the path to the totalitarian repression of its own people — then that should.

© AFP 2017/ CLEMENS BILAN Dozens of Sex Attacks Registered in Berlin Despite 'Tough' Security Measures

In a disturbing new twist to the EU’s burgeoning epidemic of migrant sex attacks, a powerful network of pro-NATO think tanks dedicated to launching ‘total war’ against Russia are scrambling an army of cyber spooks in a frantic bid to play down the upsurge in migrant-related crime over the New Year.

Cold war hawks from think tanks including the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) and the Legatum Institute have opened up a new front in their longstanding information war against both Russia and euroskeptics: the categorization of media reports on migrant criminality as a combination of ‘fake news’ and ‘far-right xenophobia.’

High Stakes

The think tanks, the nervous system of a network of lobbyists that links the eurocrats with Washington, are funded by the titans of the US arms and energy industries. The avowed mission of these policy advocates is to preserve the EU, regardless of the social cost, as a market for US defence contractors and LNG suppliers. The system is underpinned not only by political alliances between US neocons and democrats and their counterparts in NATO’s capitals- but by an intricate web of personal contacts built up since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the voluntary retreat of the Soviet Union from Eastern Europe.

In India, people just love to do and see theater. In the 19th century in the state of Bengal, in present day West Bengal, the city of Kolkata was slowly evolving and with it, the concept of proscenium theater was gradually taking shape. At present, the city of Kolkata has plenty of theatre groups consisting from entry level to senior theatre personalities, but it was one Russian gentleman named Gerasim Lebedev, who not only commercialized Bengali Theatre but also gave access to ordinary Indians to take part, act and see theatres who were otherwise not allowed to enter a proscenium theatre that was reserved only for the British.

In other words, it was Mr.Lebedev, who first made it possible for the ordinary Indians to enjoy drama in a proscenium theater. As such, the contribution of this Russian gentleman is of paramount importance in the field of Indian proscenium theater. Russian balled is also great to watch, but only a few people have access to it.

Your points do not 'purchase' you any rights and are not taken away after moderator and / or blogger priveleges have been granted.

Does earning 25,000 points automatically make me a Sputnik blogger?

In order to become a Sputnik blogger you need to apply for blogging rights: on your profile page, you will find several tabs, including the ‘Achievements’ tab. Once you’ve gained an amount of points necessary for the special status of your choosing, a new link will appear in that tab — just click it and we will review your request! You can get to your profile page by clicking on your username on the top-right corner of any page, near the time and date. Sputnik reserves the right to reject an application and / or revoke blogger priveleges after they've been granted.

Will I get paid for writing in my blog?

We are currently working on a program that could give our top bloggers an opportunity to capitalize on their talent, but it is in development as of December 2015 and we cannot disclose further details.

How do I find out how many points I’ve earned?

To find out if you’re doing well and if you’ve earned enough points to become a moderator or blogger, just visit your profile page. You can get there by clicking on your username on the top-right corner of any page, near the time and date.

The battle of Armageddon refers to the final war between human governments and God. In the book of Revelations, in Christian scriptures, this ultimate battle of good and evil takes place on a plain beneath the Israeli town of Megiddo. Most scholars agree the reference to the town is figurative only, but Tel Megiddo is just over 80 miles from embattled Damascus, Syria. I know this is an interesting revelation for some, but geographic proximity to end days is not the only “coincidental” moment of our time.

There’s a song from the 1960s that comes to mind. The melody and lyrics of the Zager and Evans super hit tune “In the Year 2525” are droning in my brain this morning, one stanza in particular:

“In the year 7510 If God's a-comin' he ought to make it by then Maybe he'll look around himself and say Guess it's time for the Judgement day.”

After you read this article, I am sure some of you will agree that God may be arriving a bit ahead of schedule. For Russians, the Chinese, and folks in Iran and millions of others worldwide, US President Barack Obama’s State Department’s “ Russian body bags of terror ” announcement to the world, is cause for fearsome contemplation. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova asked on her Facebook page:

""Don't you think that such ventriloquism about ‘body bags,' ‘terrorist attacks in Russian cities' and ‘loss of aircraft' sounds more like a ‘get 'em' command, rather than a diplomatic comment?""

While few contemporary political analysts focus on the history of Palestine, and especially not the so-called “Holy Lands”, revisiting history does reveal monstrous implications. Few geopolitical scholars today recall Palestine’s role in both World Wars.

The Battle of Megiddo of 1918, Great Britain’s crushing defeat of the Ottoman Turks, Lawrence of Arabia’s part, the latter taking of Damascus, all that drama is lost in current day propaganda and the business of détente. But the echoes of Armageddon grow louder now.

The march to Damascus, the Pursuit to Aleppo, and the crushing effects in the aftermath are still with us. The Turks are still there, the Arab tribesmen, the Brits and the Europeans, and new American adventurers are at play. What, you thought rumors Turkish President Recep Erdoğan is after a new Ottoman Empire were conjecture? That, as they say, is another story.

With biblical catastrophe in mind, anyone focused on European politics should pay keen attention to the refugee crisis, the banking situation, and the underlying potential for revisiting the holocaust. Yes, I said it; the holocaust had its roots in racial and religious divide, and especially in socio-economic frictions. In the lead up to World War II Germans carried their payday home in wheelbarrows the Mark was so worthless.

News hedge funds are pulling money out of Deutsche Bank, arguably the “brokest” bank in Europe, sets the stage for a worthless euro. Europe’s “brokenness” is further compounded by the burden of millions of refugees, and failing austerity and other economic endeavors. With the United States “leaning” on NATO allies to prop up Ukraine, and to reinvest in an arms buildup aimed at Russia, many European nations are now balking. All it will take is one more shortfall and the EU could splinter along nationalistic lines we’ve witnessed before.

Furthermore, when Chancellor Merkel’s party MP came under fire for using a Nazi propaganda term in a speech, an undercurrent that exists here in Germany was uncovered, though few fully recognized. German Bundestag representative Bettina Kudla Tweeted “The Umvolkung of Germany has already begun. There is a need for action!” – the duality of the German populace reappeared. For those unfamiliar, Umvolkung was used by Nazis to mean “ethnic transformation”, and from my discussions in the villages surrounding our offices, ethnic and cultural upheaval is the loathsome subdued fear. I do not mention this lightly either, I assure you.

We’ve lived her in Germany’s oldest city of Trier for almost a decade, and there is a duality of appearances in the country. By duality I mean, there is the side of opinion Germans show Ausländers (foreigners), and the side they reveal to neighbors and trusted friends. My “conversations” have been informative, to say the least, and of late the tone toward Chancellor Merkel and the refugees has gone full dark. N

ot only are Germans scared and worried about the scope of Frau Merkel’s refugee policies, even the most moderate among my constituents exhibit real animosity now. Where a kind of cool detachment is generally shown outwardly, beneath the calm a tempest is brewing. And the tempest is not a totally anti-Muslim trend, but anti-American is the way of the sentiment now. I leave the reader to conjure his or her own neo-fascist nightmare for now.

Vladimir Putin’s scolding of the US coalition via YouTube, when Russian air forces hammered on video those ISIL (Daesh in Arabic) tanker trucks, it was a revelation many of us thought would bring an end to the Obama shell game of protecting ISIL and other anti-Assad elements. I originally termed Central Command’s ludicrous air campaigning as “flying air cover for jihadists”. How could I have known how right I was? Who among my countrymen would have ever guessed; ""One nation under God"" recited as children in school, might ever end up anything like;""the Great, the Mother of Prostitutes and Abominations of the Earth""?

Today, the United States is in an even more provocative and desperate war, one where invisible special forces and spook advisers assist anybody that will fight the real Syrian Army. The US, Qatar, NATO, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, UAE, and fundamentalists including the rebel FSA, Ahrar al-Sham, Al-Nusra — Al-Qaeda in Syria, and the Turkmen are arrayed on one side, while the Syrian army or Assad, the NDF, Russia, Iran, Hezbollah, Shiite groups from Iraq, sit on the other.

Splattered all over the map of Syria are the Kurds and the ever more nebulous Daesh forces. Meanwhile, China’s tacit policy of non-intervention support for Assad teeters on the pinpoint of US machinations in the South China Sea and elsewhere. Joint naval drills from Russia and China of late, would tend to draw the line the west least needs to see. Returning to Armageddon, I mean Syria…

30 miles from the Syrian Golan Heights, which Israel now occupies, Tel Megiddo is now a national park. As I type this article, the mightiest forces on our planet are arrayed, essentially surrounding this focal point from ancient and modern history. For those interested, Megiddo's 5,000-year-old ""Great Temple"", which dated to the Early Bronze Age I (3500–3100 BCE), has been described as “among the largest structures of its time in the Near East”.

At the apex of the point where the world’s major religions converge, the so-called Levant (Syria-Palestine and the wide eastern Mediterranean) is not part of the Daesh identity by chance. Breaking this all down, history, tradition, religion, politics and geography all coincide very uncomfortably within international relations today. Obama withdrew from Afghanistan leaving the same mess America swore to fix. Iraq is a mess too. Libya and other Arab Spring overthrows destroyed any sense of stability in the greater region. And now American diplomats threaten to kill Russians? Right out in the open?

As an independent analyst and writer, not one of my colleagues in alternative media has any doubt any more. There is a nasty gash in civility and the polis, a wound opening along cultural, racial, religious nationalistic, economic, and geographic lines. The astute and truthful out there can see it, acknowledge it, and call attention to it, while those involved in tearing it further hide it.

In America God is out of sight, the bible or any religious texts are being made into comic books. A kid cannot even put his hand over his heart and pledge allegiance any more. In Europe atheism and agnosticism have supplanted just about every strict belief. In the western world, increasingly, being Muslim means being suspect or worse. And Russians are automatically hell bent on reclaiming a long lost Soviet Empire!

And somebody is going to accuse me of being a bible conspiracy theorist when they read this! We’ll see, is the best I can say. The only puzzle left for me is whether or not Obama or Clinton will meet the wrath of God as president. Mr. Trump will surely shoot off his own foot before getting a shot at being the Anti-Christ.

This is legalized fraud at best.

Wall Street has a new hobby use good money to create the illusion that all is well; only unlike most hobbies, the intent is to distort reality and reward lazy insiders for doing next to nothing. Gone are the days of actually trying to improve the bottom line, by improving efficiency, finding new markets, etc.; now the idea is simply cut the supply of outstanding shares, thereby magically boosting the EPS. Why are executives doing this with such impunity? The “safe harbor” rule passed in 1982, essentially allows corporations to repurchase shares without having to face charges of manipulating the price of their shares. Before the passage of this rule, stock repurchases were next to zero. In fact, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Baldwin both share the sentiment that stock buybacks should be forbidden by the SEC because they are a form of market manipulation.

Senator Baldwin issued the following statement in regards to share buybacks:

In 1982, when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a rule to provide 'safe harbor' from manipulation liability, buybacks were near zero. Last year, over $500 billion was spent on share repurchases.

Senator Warren also shares a similar sentiment

“These buybacks were treated as stock manipulation for decades because that is exactly what they are,” she said. “The SEC needs to recognize that.”

Does the SEC recognize that; apparently not as the SEC admits it not monitoring stock buybacks to prevent manipulation? SEC chair Mary White made the following comments in response to a letter addressed from Senator Baldwin

“Performing data analyses for issuer stock repurchases presents significant challenges,” White writes, “because detailed trading data regarding repurchases is not currently available.”

White goes on to state that “because Rule 10b-18 is a voluntary, safe harbor, issuers cannot violate this rule.”

Many other leaders and experts view share buybacks in a negative light

Druckenmiller told CNBC in March that he is extremely concerned about the doubling in U.S. corporate debt to roughly $7 trillion, up from about $3.5 trillion in 2007. ""Most of that mix has been in more highly leveraged stuff,"" he said. ""And if you look at what corporations have been using it for, it's all financial engineering.""

Brian Reynolds Chief Market Strategist at New Albion Partners:

“Pension funds have to make 7.5%,” so they are putting their money “in these levered credit funds that mimic Long-Term Capital Management in the 1990s.” Those funds, in turn, “buy enormous amounts of corporate bonds from companies which put cash onto company balance sheets…and they use it to jack their stock price up, either through buybacks or mergers and acquisitions…It’s just a daisy chain of financial engineering and it’s probably going to intensify in coming years.”

Stanley Druckenmiller:

""If you're running a business for the long term, the last thing you should be doing is borrowing money to buy back stock.""

Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock

“It is critical … to understand that corporate leaders’ duty of care and loyalty is not to every investor or trader who owns their companies’ shares at any moment in time, but to the company and its long-term owners,” Fink wrote in the letter, dated March 31, 2015.

James Montier:

He labels share buybacks as the “The World’s Dumbest Idea,”. He states that shareholders are not providing capital to corporations but are instead extracting it and demonstrates that since 1980 public companies have repurchased more equity than they have issued.

Harvard Business review stated the following in article title profits without prosperity

In 2012 the 500 highest-paid executives named in proxy statements of U.S. public companies received, on average, $30.3 million each; 42% of their compensation came from stock options and 41% from stock awards. By increasing the demand for a company’s shares, open-market buybacks automatically lift its stock price, even if only temporarily, and can enable the company to hit quarterly earnings per share (EPS) targets. Full Story

Bottom line, they can do what they want without having to worry about any repercussions. It’s like giving a prisoner the keys to the cell and telling him to make sure the door to the jail cell remains locked at all times.

Stock repurchases are nothing but a nefarious, albeit cunning account trick to inflate the widely followed earning per share statistic for a stock. The old way of increasing EPS was to increase profits, but the cunning and gray method is to decrease the number of outstanding shares. In the present environment of tough corporate profits, this simple trick can make the difference between demonstrating declining or rising profits. In this ultra-low interest atmosphere, cash is cheap and given the challenges most corporations face in improving the bottom line, taking the easy out makes sense. Most executives see this as a win-win situation; get paid handsomely for doing nothing.

In a recent report, CNN money states that that dividend and stock buybacks will new a new high of $ one trillion in 2015. Gold Sachs is expecting that number to surge for 2016; they state this number will increase by 7% in 2016, surpassing the one trillion mark.

Everyone is joining the party now because it’s the easiest way to improve the bottom line; just take a look at some of the recent participants

© Photo: Tactical Investor Chart shows that the supply of the outstanding number of shares has continued to drop while the demand has held.

The above chart shows that the supply of the outstanding number of shares has continued to drop while the demand has held. Consider this, since 2009; corporations have spent over $2.4 trillion on share buybacks. The above figure matches the Feds current balance sheet, which has soared to $2.4 trillion since the inception of QE.

Conclusion

Despite all the noise, nothing is going to change on Wall Street for greed overrules everything else. Morales are meaningless in the land of lust and greed, and unless strict new laws are put in place or the safe harbor rule is repelled, nothing will change. Why would executives take a large pay cut when they can legally take this route, do next to nothing and walk away with a fortune. Would you do things differently if the roles were reversed? Maybe some of you would respond with a yes, but the vast majority would probably be only too glad to follow the same path.

As long as compensation is based on share performance, except the outlook to worsen. The era of cheap money only adds fuel to an already raging fire. Against this backdrop of so-called wonderful growth, share prices have doubled over the past five years and so has corporate debt. This party will not end well, but waiting for that day, could mean financial loss for you. There is a vast chasm that separates being right and being right at the right time. Wall Street is lined with Tombstones of people who were right but could not stay solvent long enough to benefit from their convictions. We expect corporate to debt to soar to heights that could make the current levels appear sane in nature. Translation, stock prices could continue trending upwards for far longer than most envision.

The first and worst of all frauds is to cheat one's self. All sin is easy after that. Pearl Bailey"

The above chart shows that the supply of the outstanding number of shares has continued to drop while the demand has held. Consider this, since 2009; corporations have spent over $2.4 trillion on share buybacks. The above figure matches the Feds current balance sheet, which has soared to $2.4 trillion since the inception of QE.

Conclusion

Despite all the noise, nothing is going to change on Wall Street for greed overrules everything else. Morales are meaningless in the land of lust and greed, and unless strict new laws are put in place or the safe harbor rule is repelled, nothing will change. Why would executives take a large pay cut when they can legally take this route, do next to nothing and walk away with a fortune. Would you do things differently if the roles were reversed? Maybe some of you would respond with a yes, but the vast majority would probably be only too glad to follow the same path.

As long as compensation is based on share performance, except the outlook to worsen. The era of cheap money only adds fuel to an already raging fire. Against this backdrop of so-called wonderful growth, share prices have doubled over the past five years and so has corporate debt. This party will not end well, but waiting for that day, could mean financial loss for you. There is a vast chasm that separates being right and being right at the right time. Wall Street is lined with Tombstones of people who were right but could not stay solvent long enough to benefit from their convictions. We expect corporate to debt to soar to heights that could make the current levels appear sane in nature. Translation, stock prices could continue trending upwards for far longer than most envision.

The first and worst of all frauds is to cheat one's self. All sin is easy after that. Pearl Bailey"

© AFP 2017/ Mark RALSTON Empire of Whiners

With an Orwellian 99% majority that would delight the Kim dynasty in North Korea, the ""representative democracy"" Capitol Hill has bulldozed its latest House/Senate sanctions package , aimed mostly at Russia, but also targeting Iran and North Korea.

The White House's announcement — late Friday afternoon in the middle of summer — that President Trump has approved and will sign the bill was literally buried in the news cycle amidst the proverbial 24/7 Russia-gate related hysteria.

Trump will be required to justify to Congress, in writing, any initiative to ease sanctions on Russia. And Congress is entitled to launch an automatic review of any such initiative.

Translation; the death knell of any possibility for the White House to reset relations with Russia. Congress in fact is just ratifying the ongoing Russia demonization campaign orchestrated by the neocon and neoliberalcon deep state/War Party establishment.

Economic war has been declared against Russia for at least three years now. The difference is this latest package also declares economic war against Europe, especially Germany.

That centers on the energy front, by demonizing the implementation of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and forcing the EU to buy US natural gas.

Make no mistake; the EU leadership will counterpunch. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission (EC), put it mildly when he said, ""America first cannot mean that Europe's interests come last.""

On the Russia front, what the Empire of Sanctions faces does not even qualify as a hollow victory. Kommersant has reported that Moscow, among other actions, will retaliate by banning all American IT companies and all US agricultural products from the Russian market, as well as exporting titanium to Boeing (30% of which comes from Russia).

On the Russia-China strategic partnership front, trying to restrict Russia-EU energy deals will only allow more currency swaps between the ruble and the yuan; a key plank of the post-US dollar multipolar world.

And then there's the possible, major game-changer; the German front.

The Fools on the Hill

Even without considering the stellar historical record of Washington not only meddling but bombing and regime-changing vast swathes of the planet — from Iraq and Libya to the current threats against Iran, Venezuela and North Korea — the Russia-gate hysteria about meddling in the 2016 US presidential election is a non-story, by now thoroughly debunked.

The heart of the matter is, once again, energy wars.

According to a Middle East-based US energy source not hostage to the Beltway consensus, ""the message in these sanctions is the EU has no future unless it buys US natural gas to cut out Russia. To deny Russia the natural gas market of the EU was the goal behind the just lost war in Syria to put the Qatar-Saudi Arabia-Syria-Turkey-EU pipeline in and the opening to Iran for an Iran-Iraq-Syria-Turkey-EU pipeline. None of these plans worked.""

The source adds as evidence the 2014 oil price war against Russia, orchestrated by ""the dumping of Gulf States' surplus oil or reserve capacity on the world market. Since this has failed to bring Russia to its knees, the destruction of the Russian natural gas market in the EU has become a national priority for the United States.""

As it stands, 30% of all EU oil and natural gas imports come from Russia. In parallel, the Russia-China energy partnership is being progressively enhanced. Russia is already geared to increase oil and gas exports to China and Asia as a whole.

The leadership in Berlin is now convinced that Washington is jeopardizing Germany's energy diversification/energy security via the sanctions war. Russian natural gas and oil is secured by overland routes and is not dependent on the oceans, which, as the energy source stresses, ""are no longer under United States control. If Russia in response to United States belligerency drops an Iron Curtain over Europe, and redirects all its natural gas and oil exports to China and Asia, Europe will be utterly dependent on largely insecure sources of natural gas and oil such as the Middle East and Africa.""

And that bring us to the ""nuclear"" possibility in the horizon; a Germany-Russia alignment in a Reinsurance Treaty, as first established by Bismarck. CIA-related US Think Tankland is now actively discussing the possibility.

Another US business/political source, also a practitioner of thinking outside the (Beltway) box, stresses, ""this is what it's all about. That is the true goal of Russia, and the United States has fallen into the trap. The United States has had enough of Germany and what it considers dumping of German products on the United States through rigged currency. They are now threatening Germany with sanctions, and there is nothing Germany can do with the EU on their back facing vetoes from Poland, who is giving them trouble once again. The fools in Congress are really going after Germany, and throwing Germany in the arms of Russia.""

The US as the New Carthage

A possible Germany-Russia alliance, as I've written before, rounds up the China/Russia/Germany entente capable of reorganizing the entire Eurasian land mass.

The Russia-China strategic partnership is extremely attractive to German business, as it smoothes access via the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). According to the business/political source, ""the US is at war with China and Russia (but not Trump, our President) and Germany is having second thoughts about being nuclear cannon fodder for the US. I have discussed this in Germany, and they are thinking of renewing the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia. No one trusts this US Congress; it is considered a lunatic asylum. Merkel may be asked to leave for the leadership of the UN, and then the treaty would be signed. It will shake the world and end any thought of the United States being a global power, which it isn't anymore.""

© Sputnik/ Natalia Seliverstova German Businesses 'Interested' in Lifting Sanctions to Develop Ties With Russia

The source adds, half in zest, ""we think that Brzezinski died under the pressure of the realization that this was coming and that all his hatred of Russia and his life work to destroy them was becoming utterly undone.""

So, in a sense, it's ""welcome to the 1930s all over again and the rise of nationalism in Europe. This time Germany will not make the mistakes of 1914 and 1941 but will stand against their traditional Anglo-Saxon enemies. The United States has truly become today's Carthage and the disorder in Congress reflects the same stupidity of Carthage facing Rome. Legislators undermined their genius Hannibal as they are undermining the greatest president of the United States since Andrew Jackson. As Sophocles wrote in 'Antigone', 'God first makes mad those he wishes to destroy.' This Congress is mad.""

International media lit up in feverish speculation earlier this week after unsubstantiated reports emerged once again that Russia is supposedly arming the Taliban. Moscow struck back at these accusations by decrying them as baseless and part of a US disinformation campaign, which they are, but a few more words need to be offered about this provocative episode in order to place it into its proper context.

The US is aghast that Russia has taken the lead in organizing the Moscow peace process for Afghanistan, which has already seen three meetings hosted in the Russian capital involving all of the war-torn country’s regional stakeholders.

Granted, there’s still a lot of work that needs to be done before this framework can yield anything resembling tangible results, but it’s nevertheless a constructive step in the right direction and presents a multipolar alternative to the previously American-dominated initiatives on this issue.

Importantly, Russia’s policy has recently evolved to the point where Moscow has come to regard the Taliban as an indispensable party to reaching a political solution to the War on Afghanistan, and this is largely due to the group’s effective anti-terrorist fight against Daesh.

© AP Photo/ Allauddin Khan Daesh Declares War on Taliban - Reports

Russia has been warning for the past couple years about the “Islamic State’s” creeping infiltration into the Afghan battlespace, and the organization’s spate of attacks there over the past year have vindicated everything that Moscow was concerned about it and given its peace efforts a renewed impetus.

Correspondingly, Russia has also been engaged in a fast-moving and comprehensive rapprochement with Pakistan during this time as well, motivated by the shared threat that Daesh’s activities in Afghanistan pose to both Great Powers.

Pakistan is more directly affected by this stemming from the fact that it borders Afghanistan and that terrorists there could be exploited by Islamabad’s adversaries to wage the Hybrid War on CPEC, but Russia is also at risk because any large-scale destabilization of its CSTO allies in Central Asia could draw it into a new military conflict and also generate uncontrollable waves of “Weapons of Mass Migration” which could crash into the Russian heartland.

For these reasons, Russia and Pakistan have a common interest in bringing peace to Afghanistan and incorporating the Taliban into the country’s political process, but it’s this combination of factors which has thrown the US’ permanent military, intelligence, and diplomatic bureaucracies (the “deep state”) into such a tizzy. They understand the game-changing implications of the Russian-Pakistan rapprochement and fear that it might grow to the level of a geostrategic partnership, which is why they’re so eager to disrupt it at all costs.

There’s no better way to simultaneously complicate the security situation for both Russia and Pakistan than to destabilize the situation in Afghanistan, though the unintended blowback of this could inevitably be the further strengthening and possible expansion of the unfolding rapprochement between both sides in response.

Regardless of the possibly counterproductive consequences, the US “deep state” seems to have made up its mind to dispatch more soldiers to Afghanistan in order to bring this about, which could have the effect of intensifying the Taliban-Kabul conflict and preventing both sides from pooling their efforts together to defeat Daesh, to say nothing of advancing a political solution to their long-running war.

Trump, on the other hand, while grasping the strategic significance of deploying more boots on the ground in this tri-regional pivot state at the crossroads of West, Central, and South Asia, is also worried about the domestic political repercussions of doing so, especially if this results in more body bags being sent back to the homeland.

Furthermore, Trump distrusts his “deep state” to the point of being suspicious of practically all of his appointees, including his own National Security Advisor General H. R. McMaster according to reports. This senior administration figure had apparently been lobbying the President to authorize more troops to Afghanistan, but Politico writes that this was in vain because a “sh*t show” recently ensued which saw Trump dramatically rebuking McMaster by declining to deploy more soldiers and humiliatingly ordering the General’s proposal back to the drawing board.

It’s not known with any degree of absolute certainty why he made this decision, but it’s likely that the aforementioned domestic political considerations and “deep state” distrust played a guiding role, as well as the influence of his Chief Strategist Steve Bannon.

Reports circulated earlier this month that the former Breitbart executive is urging Trump to “outsource” the war to private military contractors (PMCs, also known as mercenaries) such as those under the control of his friend and infamous Blackwater founder Erik Prince.

The idea behind this proposal is that swapping uniformed US troops with PMCs will allow Trump to disingenuously make the case that he’s drawing down America’s conventional involvement in the War on Afghanistan and therefore win political points at home, all the while silently expanding its informal footprint through more mercenaries, many of whom are former US military personnel anyhow.

It’s also politically convenient for another reason as well – as the war intensifies, more Americans will inevitably be killed, but the public doesn’t react the same way to a mercenary’s death as they do to an official soldier’s, and the former isn’t necessarily a matter of public record, either.

US military casualties – whether uniformed or private – will probably become a more frequent occurrence in Afghanistan if Trump has his way in prying the country’s gargantuan untapped mineral reserves from the Taliban.

The New York Times reported earlier this week about how the President is now interested in the estimated $1 trillion of resources lying under Afghanistan’s soil, a sizeable chunk of which is presently under the Taliban’s control and consists of the rare earth minerals that China presently has a monopoly on.

These metals are indispensable to modern-day civilian electronics such as cell phones and military equipment like precision-guided missiles, so there’s clearly a strategic motivation for the US to dominate the extraction of Afghan minerals in order to either deny this resource to its competitors or control their access to it.

The resultant strategy that’s coming into play is one in which the US wants to push the Taliban out of its resource-rich areas, extract and export the rare earth minerals under the soil there, and ensure sustainable security for this entire operation, with the point of contention within the administration coming down to whether it should be uniformed US soldiers or private mercenaries that fight the Taliban.

The “deep state” wants the Pentagon to be in charge of this because it would guarantee that billions of tax-payer dollars continue pouring into their Afghan slush fund, which is notoriously known to be full of waste and corruption, because the pecuniary advantages to be reaped from PMCs are considerably limited to much fewer individuals such as Erik Prince and Stephen Feinberg (the owner of the DynCorp PMC), both of whom are regarded as Trump’s advisors.

In order to push their case that the military should be in charge of this ultra-profitable operation, the “deep state” concocted the fake news conspiracy theory that “Russia is arming the Taliban” in order to “play the Russia card” in pressuring Trump to side with the Pentagon as opposed to the PMCs.

They thought that they could manipulate the President into doing whatever they wanted on the foreign policy front so long as they found a way to incorporate the ongoing anti-Russian witch hunt into their demands, though it looks like Trump isn’t as doing what they expected (or at least not right away) because his personal cohorts have a financial interest in this enterprise too. No matter what Trump ultimately decides, and whether it’s to go forward with McMaster’s uniformed troop surge, the Bannon-Price-Feinberg PMC proposal, or a combination thereof, the US will do whatever it can to prevent the Moscow peace process from succeeding.

The $1 trillion mineral bonanza that’s made Trump all of a sudden interested in Afghanistan is too big of a potential prize for the billionaire businessman to pass up, and he knows that the US won’t be able to extract its envied mineral resources as long as the Taliban retains control of the territory above them.

Therefore, it’s expected that the US will attempt in one way or another – whether through the Pentagon and/or PMCs – to go on the offensive against the Taliban, possibly by having its soldiers and/or mercenaries play a decisive “Lead From Behind” role in using Kabul’s fighters as cannon fodder to this effect. The anticipated escalation of the War on Afghanistan and the inevitable window of opportunity that Daesh will see in all of this are bound to negatively impact on the security situation in the surrounding states, but it will also make it all the more important that Russia and Pakistan take their strategic cooperation to the next level in formulating a joint response.

0,http://sputniknews.com/columnists/201707251055851782-space-race-fifty-years-on/#comments,sputniknews,A Rocket to the Moon! Remembering the Space Race Fifty Years On,[],"It's exactly fifty years ago since the Russians got to the moon first. Yes, that's right. The Russians.

Well, at least that appeared to be the case in the film Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon, released in that wonderfully groovy Summer of Love in 1967.

A whimsical and utterly charming international comedy about a space race in 19th century Britain, shot in glorious Eastman color and filmed in Ireland's stunningly picturesque Wicklow Mountains, Rocket to the Moon encapsulated the sunny optimism of the era in which it was made.

""The music is a highlight and it is almost impossible to find, at times, a happier little film than this one is in spots,"" says one reviewer on IMDb.com.

At the time the film (whose American title was Those Fantastic Flying Fools) was released in July 1967, there was of course a real-life ""moon race"" going on between the US and the USSR — and one that didn't involve Tsarist agents, Troy Donahue and Phineas T. Barnum.

The Soviets had launched the first artificial satellite, (Sputnik, of course!) and put the first man (Yuri Gagarin) and the first woman (Valentina Tereshkova) into space. They also put the first animal into orbit too — a little dog named Laika.

Soviet achievements were being praised even by leading British Tory MPs.

""Forty years ago the Soviet Union was a backward country, poor, illiterate, and agricultural. Today she is identified with prodigious feats of science and technology,"" enthused Aubrey Jones in 1961 in the Sunday Times.

But the Americans, beaten in other areas, were determined to get to the moon first. President Kennedy proposed, in May 1961, that ""before this decade is out"" the US would land a man on the moon and return him safely to earth. ""We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard,"" Kennedy said eighteen months later at Rice University.

When Rocket to the Moon was released, we were in fact just two years away — to the very week — from the US achieving its goal — even though JFK sadly wasn't there to see it.

The Cold War had ""moved to the heavens,"" in the words of Jeremy Isaacs and Taylor Downing. But weren't we better off seeing a space race rather than increased hostilities on earth? Back in the 1960s we were all — to paraphrase Oscar Wilde — looking at the stars, and our dreams were very big indeed.

Fifty years ago, it seemed, as in the Victorian era — that all things were possible. A man on the moon. Supersonic passenger planes. The work-life balance sorted. Global equality. The eradication of terrible diseases. A genuine internationalism based on mutual respect between nations and cultures. There were still many problems, but the setbacks the US was experiencing in Vietnam, and the popular opposition to that war the world over were signs that imperialism had hit a brick wall.

Growing detente between east and west, brought about because the US couldn't get its way in south-east Asia, led many to hope that the Cold War would end in a merging of two systems. Western countries were certainly becoming more socialistic — with full employment, generous welfare provision and an extension of public ownership the norm. The working man — and woman — had never had it so good, in east and west. Music and films reflected the ""feel good"" factor of the time. The number one record of fifty years ago was appropriately enough ""All you need is love.""

So where did it all go wrong?

The problem was that those who supported detente in the west were pushed aside by those who wanted to destroy the Soviet Union, and indeed any economic system which put the needs of the majority first. The 1970s were the apogee of progressive politics, with historically low levels of inequality, and historically high levels of social/public ownership, but the decade also witnessed the start of the neocon/neoliberal fight back.

We saw examples of this with the toppling of the democratically elected socialist Salvador Allende in Chile in 1973, and the restructuring of the Chilean economy by ""The Chicago Boys"" — and in the battles inside the Carter administration from 1977-80. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance wanted to strengthen detente, but the aggressive hawk Zbigniew Brzezinski — Carter's National Security adviser, persuaded the president to back Islamist ""rebels"" in Afghanistan in order to ""bleed"" the Soviet Union for ""as much and as long as is possible.""

Things got even worse under Ronald Reagan, who stepped up the program for aiding the ""Mujahideen,"" leading to the birth of al-Qaeda. While in Britain, Margaret Thatcher, a Cold War warrior for the 1%, set about dismantling the equitable post-war economic settlement with glee.

The fall of communism at the very end of the 80s, cheered on even not just by the neo-cons, but by many ""progressives"" too, paved the way for a new, even more aggressive form of neo-liberalism and a series of brutal wars against independent nations by the US and its closest allies.

The results have been truly catastrophic. Today, half the world's wealth is owned by just eight individuals, while the living standards of ordinary people continues to fall.

""At home Euro-American policy elites — the least needy people the world has ever seen — are driving through a hard neo-liberal agenda in order to gnaw away at wages within their own territories."" writes Robert Hunter Wade, professor of political economy.

""Regime-change"" wars — waged for the benefit of the elites — have destroyed whole countries, created a refugee crisis of biblical proportions and helped spread terrorism around the globe.

We don't get films like Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon made any more. We get much darker artistic offerings, reflecting our more fearful, depressed times: The Hunger Games, Game of Thrones, Broadchurch and Nordic Noir films.

But remembering the Swinging Sixties, the race to the moon, and the cheery optimism of those much happier days, shows us it doesn't have to be like this.

Not BRICS+, For Sure",[],"So, who is hampering international trade? Experts agree that the recent summit of the G20 in Hamburg was characterized by certain changes in the dividing lines between economic “globalists” and “nationalists.”

President Donald Trump, the representative of the biggest of the “old successful” economies (the so called G7 group, formed back in the 1970s) was accused of protectionism. This was something new and unexpected for G20, a group created with the specific aim of fighting “protectionist instincts,” with the United States supposedly playing the role of the main lobbyist of free trade.

Sanctions as ""Adhesive"" for the West

The situation when the American president is almost officially called a destabilizing factor and even “a threat to European security” (in the words of the European Council’s head Donald Tusk) – this situation is disconcerting for the whole community of Western nations. In these circumstances, the so far futile economic sanctions that they jointly imposed on Russia may serve as a form of adhesive for the Western alliances.

So, even though these sanctions have so far failed to return to the “revolutionary” regime in Kiev its “counterrevolutionary” territories in the Russian-speaking east and south, attempts to economically strangle Donbass, Crimea and Russia as a whole will stay with us for duration. These sanctions are not needed by the people of Russia or Ukraine, but they help to keep the Western alliances and their loyal elite in Kiev together.

However, the recent American bill on anti-Russian sanctions, approved by the US congress’s House of Representatives, obviously went too far even for European politicians. The bill was criticized in a statement of the European Commission, and members of the business community questioned the legality of additional scrutiny and even punishments, which the bill imposes on the businessmen having connections to the Kremlin.

Wider Context

Anything can be a reason for sanctions from today’s Western world – the willingness of Crimeans to live in Russia, China’s attempt to build artificial islands in South China sea or even Poland’s judicial reform. Viewed in a wider context, the anti-Russian sanctions fit a general pattern of America’s and the EU’s attempts to economically sideline not just Russia, but any potential economic competitors, including China and other BRICS countries (BRICS standing for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa). The long history of the economic isolation of the former Soviet Union and Mao’s People’s Republic of China seems to confirm the feasibility of such plans on the side of the US and the EU. So, it is the West, and not Russia or China who does not want free trade.

What will be Russia’s response?

The Russian president Vladimir Putin at the summit in Hamburg called the anti-Russian economic sanctions “a hidden form of protectionism.” Moscow on a number of occasions stated that “sanctions are not our initiative” and vowed to continue looking for trade deals with the EU and other Western entities.

The Chinese leader Xi Jinping, speaking a few months earlier at the international business forum in Davos, Switzerland, praised global trade, saying that China was not afraid of fair competition. So, the Russian and Chinese leaders have learnt the lesson of the Soviet Union and of Mao’s China: self-isolation is not the answer, if anyone is against free trade, it is not us.

The irony of history is that supposedly “not open societies” of Russia and China at the G20 summit spoke out against protectionism, while the president of the biggest “open society” Donald Trump used protectionist rhetoric.

Ways to the Future

Whatever our old hopes and new expectations, one new development has to be admitted and accepted: the old core-periphery model of globalization is becoming simply dangerous for sustainable development.

The “core” in the old form of the G7 countries is no longer as all-mighty and reliable as before, and its “peacemaker credentials” are irrevocably tarnished by its interventions in the former Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya and Syria. The former periphery (especially the BRICS countries) is no longer the periphery any more, having gained substantial economic and political weight. So, the old “core-periphery” model, already characterized by imbalances and inequality, has to give way to “no core – no periphery” model of BRICS + (meaning BRICS plus its members’ regional and non-regional partner countries).

China, which is expected to host the next BRICS summit , lauded the BRICS+ project as the priority of the BRICS’ agenda for the years 2017-2018.

In a way the ideology of BRICS + could perhaps be called a different form of globalism. In some ways, BRICS+ is similar to the combination of TPP and TTIP, once lobbied for by the former president Obama. Just like BRICS+, the TPP-TTIP combination also includes five key pillars (also spread representatively across continents), namely the US, Japan, Canada, Australia and the EU.

The fact that BRICS countries are located on different continents (Russia, China and India being placed in Eurasia, while Brazil is in south America and South Africa occupies the farthest tip of the African continent) – this fact had long been seen as a weakness of BRICS. “What can such distant lands have in common?” – so sounded the common wisdom. But seen from the globalization point of view, this weakness becomes a strength. Located on three different continents, the BRICS countries might become “poles of attraction” for the developing economies of the “global South,” offering what might be termed as “balanced regionalism” as an attractive alternative to the old “core and periphery” model.

China’s One Belt One Road is a good example of an integration project which gives a chance to three beneficiaries: Russia, the developing economies located along the route of the ancient Silk Road and the countries of the former Soviet Union.

The EU member states are also going to be beneficiaries, with the Silk Road routes ultimately leading to their territories. And there are other examples of the budding BRICS+ relationships:

Russia-centered Eurasian Economic Union has a free trade agreement (FTA) with Vietnam; Latin American MERCOSUR union of countries (with Brazil at its center) has a free-trade agreement with Israel.

No More ""Forced"" Globalizations

BRICS+ formula can also benefit rich countries, becoming a framework for the already existing free-trade agreements (FTAs): one can mention the FTA between European Free Trade Agreement (EFTA) and the South African Customs Union (SACU), or the Japan-India comprehensive economic partnership agreement.

A new type of economic integration with BRICS+ at its center would provide a welcome alternative to the old US-EU-centric model of globalization which forced shock therapy on its peripheral countries (Russia and many countries of Latin America had a negative experience with this kind of “therapy”).

Even if for some time the Western globalization model and BRICS+ might coexist, this would provide the much needed competition in globalization models: a lot of experts explain the failures of the US-EU-centered globalization model (such as the 2007-2009 crisis) by absence of alternatives, which led to absence of competition and subsequent dearth of new ideas.

For Both Poor and Rich

The BRICS+ model is not going to ignore the existing rich countries or the already functioning global institutions, such as the World Trade Organization WTO.

The aim of BRICS+ is not to dominate, but to offer a link between the existing global institutions (such as WTO and IMF) and the amalgam of developing countries. The economic and financial weight of developing countries is no longer negligible: 14 out of 15 largest sovereign wealth funds are owned by the developing countries. However, these countries are underrepresented in the existing international institutions, still dominated by the G7. For example, in the IMF the consolidated share of the BRICS is just below the 15 percent mark. The addition of BRICS+ partners would raise the consolidated share of the vote by 1-2 percentage points to more than 15 percent. This would enable the BRICS+ to have a blocking stake with respect to the key decisions of the Fund.

It should be noted that countries willing to conduct a sovereign foreign policy (such as Russia and China) are interested in closer cooperation in the framework of BRICS+ also for financial security reasons. The modern Western elite is now often willing to use its dominance in the financial sphere for punishing the defiant international actors: the long-lasting exclusion of Iran from the operation of SWIFT system of international payments comes to mind. The BRICS+ could serve as a platform creation of its member countries’ sovereign payment systems. It could also be used for extending the use of national currencies in mutual trade transactions, thus reducing the dependence of BRICS and other non-Western countries on dollar and euro.

There is no doubt that the gaps and fissures which became apparent in the US-EU-centered economic system at the G20 summit in Hamburg – these gaps and fissures will only accelerate the creation and development of the BRICS+ integration model. There is too much void to fill on the currently monopolized market of “globalization models.”

So, even though these sanctions have so far failed to return to the “revolutionary” regime in Kiev its “counterrevolutionary” territories in the Russian-speaking east and south, attempts to economically strangle Donbass, Crimea and Russia as a whole will stay with us for duration. These sanctions are not needed by the people of Russia or Ukraine, but they help to keep the Western alliances and their loyal elite in Kiev together.

However, the recent American bill on anti-Russian sanctions, approved by the US congress’s House of Representatives, obviously went too far even for European politicians. The bill was criticized in a statement of the European Commission, and members of the business community questioned the legality of additional scrutiny and even punishments, which the bill imposes on the businessmen having connections to the Kremlin.

Wider Context

Anything can be a reason for sanctions from today’s Western world – the willingness of Crimeans to live in Russia, China’s attempt to build artificial islands in South China sea or even Poland’s judicial reform. Viewed in a wider context, the anti-Russian sanctions fit a general pattern of America’s and the EU’s attempts to economically sideline not just Russia, but any potential economic competitors, including China and other BRICS countries (BRICS standing for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa). The long history of the economic isolation of the former Soviet Union and Mao’s People’s Republic of China seems to confirm the feasibility of such plans on the side of the US and the EU. So, it is the West, and not Russia or China who does not want free trade.

What will be Russia’s response?

The Russian president Vladimir Putin at the summit in Hamburg called the anti-Russian economic sanctions “a hidden form of protectionism.” Moscow on a number of occasions stated that “sanctions are not our initiative” and vowed to continue looking for trade deals with the EU and other Western entities.

The Chinese leader Xi Jinping, speaking a few months earlier at the international business forum in Davos, Switzerland, praised global trade, saying that China was not afraid of fair competition. So, the Russian and Chinese leaders have learnt the lesson of the Soviet Union and of Mao’s China: self-isolation is not the answer, if anyone is against free trade, it is not us.

The irony of history is that supposedly “not open societies” of Russia and China at the G20 summit spoke out against protectionism, while the president of the biggest “open society” Donald Trump used protectionist rhetoric.

Ways to the Future

Whatever our old hopes and new expectations, one new development has to be admitted and accepted: the old core-periphery model of globalization is becoming simply dangerous for sustainable development.

The “core” in the old form of the G7 countries is no longer as all-mighty and reliable as before, and its “peacemaker credentials” are irrevocably tarnished by its interventions in the former Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya and Syria. The former periphery (especially the BRICS countries) is no longer the periphery any more, having gained substantial economic and political weight. So, the old “core-periphery” model, already characterized by imbalances and inequality, has to give way to “no core – no periphery” model of BRICS + (meaning BRICS plus its members’ regional and non-regional partner countries).

China, which is expected to host the next BRICS summit , lauded the BRICS+ project as the priority of the BRICS’ agenda for the years 2017-2018.

In a way the ideology of BRICS + could perhaps be called a different form of globalism. In some ways, BRICS+ is similar to the combination of TPP and TTIP, once lobbied for by the former president Obama. Just like BRICS+, the TPP-TTIP combination also includes five key pillars (also spread representatively across continents), namely the US, Japan, Canada, Australia and the EU.

The fact that BRICS countries are located on different continents (Russia, China and India being placed in Eurasia, while Brazil is in south America and South Africa occupies the farthest tip of the African continent) – this fact had long been seen as a weakness of BRICS. “What can such distant lands have in common?” – so sounded the common wisdom. But seen from the globalization point of view, this weakness becomes a strength. Located on three different continents, the BRICS countries might become “poles of attraction” for the developing economies of the “global South,” offering what might be termed as “balanced regionalism” as an attractive alternative to the old “core and periphery” model.

China’s One Belt One Road is a good example of an integration project which gives a chance to three beneficiaries: Russia, the developing economies located along the route of the ancient Silk Road and the countries of the former Soviet Union.

The EU member states are also going to be beneficiaries, with the Silk Road routes ultimately leading to their territories. And there are other examples of the budding BRICS+ relationships:

Russia-centered Eurasian Economic Union has a free trade agreement (FTA) with Vietnam; Latin American MERCOSUR union of countries (with Brazil at its center) has a free-trade agreement with Israel.

No More ""Forced"" Globalizations

BRICS+ formula can also benefit rich countries, becoming a framework for the already existing free-trade agreements (FTAs): one can mention the FTA between European Free Trade Agreement (EFTA) and the South African Customs Union (SACU), or the Japan-India comprehensive economic partnership agreement.

A new type of economic integration with BRICS+ at its center would provide a welcome alternative to the old US-EU-centric model of globalization which forced shock therapy on its peripheral countries (Russia and many countries of Latin America had a negative experience with this kind of “therapy”).

Even if for some time the Western globalization model and BRICS+ might coexist, this would provide the much needed competition in globalization models: a lot of experts explain the failures of the US-EU-centered globalization model (such as the 2007-2009 crisis) by absence of alternatives, which led to absence of competition and subsequent dearth of new ideas.

For Both Poor and Rich

The BRICS+ model is not going to ignore the existing rich countries or the already functioning global institutions, such as the World Trade Organization WTO.

The aim of BRICS+ is not to dominate, but to offer a link between the existing global institutions (such as WTO and IMF) and the amalgam of developing countries. The economic and financial weight of developing countries is no longer negligible: 14 out of 15 largest sovereign wealth funds are owned by the developing countries. However, these countries are underrepresented in the existing international institutions, still dominated by the G7. For example, in the IMF the consolidated share of the BRICS is just below the 15 percent mark. The addition of BRICS+ partners would raise the consolidated share of the vote by 1-2 percentage points to more than 15 percent. This would enable the BRICS+ to have a blocking stake with respect to the key decisions of the Fund.

It should be noted that countries willing to conduct a sovereign foreign policy (such as Russia and China) are interested in closer cooperation in the framework of BRICS+ also for financial security reasons. The modern Western elite is now often willing to use its dominance in the financial sphere for punishing the defiant international actors: the long-lasting exclusion of Iran from the operation of SWIFT system of international payments comes to mind. The BRICS+ could serve as a platform creation of its member countries’ sovereign payment systems. It could also be used for extending the use of national currencies in mutual trade transactions, thus reducing the dependence of BRICS and other non-Western countries on dollar and euro.

There is no doubt that the gaps and fissures which became apparent in the US-EU-centered economic system at the G20 summit in Hamburg – these gaps and fissures will only accelerate the creation and development of the BRICS+ integration model. There is too much void to fill on the currently monopolized market of “globalization models.”

The US has lost its six-year war for regime change in the Arab country. It's time to wrap it up.

It's not over yet, of course. It remains to be seen if Trump's decision can in fact be implemented. Can the CIA be reined in to obey orders? Will the US be able to stop regional client regimes, like Saudi Arabia, from stepping up their covert supply of American weapons to the militants in Syria?

Also, Trump's decision does not mean the US and its allies will withdraw ground and air forces from Syria, where they are illegally operating in violation of international law.

© AFP 2017/ LOUAI BESHARA End of CIA Program for Syrian Rebels Means Assad's Removal From Power No Longer Priority for US

Nevertheless, the American president's declared ending of the CIA's role in fueling the insurgency in Syria should be seen as a welcome move. It is the right thing to do, and a brave one also because of the anti-Russia flak he is bound to receive for taking the decision. It would have been politically expedient for Trump to have not pulled the plug on the CIA in Syria. But by doing so, he is bound to compound the anti-Russia hysteria gripping Washington and large sections of the media accusing him of being a ""Kremlin stooge"".

Any rational person would have to agree that the best way to end the violence in Syria is for foreign countries to halt pouring weapons into the country. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has long maintained this logical position: if nations want Syria's bloodshed to stop, as they claim, then they should stop supplying arms and cut out sponsoring militant groups.

By its own admission, the US has been funneling weapons into Syria since at least 2013, according to media reports, and probably before that date right back to the beginning of the war in March 2011. Not only the US but its NATO partners, Britain, France and Turkey, as well as regional allies Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Israel. This is an admission of a criminal conspiracy to destabilize a sovereign country by supporting illegally armed anti-government militant groups. It matters little whether these groups are arbitrarily designated ""moderate rebels"". They are illegally armed.

With a Syrian death toll of up to 400,000 over six years of war, millions of refugees and a culturally rich country driven to the brink of destruction, it is blindingly obvious that Trump made the right call to at least partially reduce the flow of weapons, by ending the CIA program. It is well past time to bring the US-led criminal assault on Syria to an end.

Trump's call was also a brave one because the US media immediately and predictably depicted the move as a ""concession to Russia"". With the US president already being assailed with endless accusations of ""colluding"" with Russia in winning the election to the White House last year, his decision to leash the dogs of war in Syria this week only lends more grist to the Russophobia rumor mill.

The Washington Post headlined the news with: ""Trump ends covert CIA program to arm anti-Assad rebels in Syria, a move sought by Moscow"".

Several other US media outlets followed suit, making snide comments that the move ""will please the Kremlin"" and that Trump was ""appeasing Putin"" by closing down the CIA covert operations in Syria.

The American corporate media persist with the myth that the CIA has been backing ""moderate rebels"". When in reality, the ""moderate rebels"" and the ""terrorist jihadists"" are one and the same motley army of mercenaries. Mercenaries who have barbarized the Syrian people with sickening massacres, under the tutelage of the CIA and other foreign military services.

With contorted logic, US media spin that Trump's shuttering of the CIA program to train ""moderate rebels"" in Syria may now strengthen the hand of ""extremists"".

There are mutterings in the US media suggesting that this is what Trump talked about with Putin during their meetings in Hamburg at the G20 summit earlier this month. Especially, during the so-called ""secret meeting"" in front of 18 other heads of state while at dinner.

What the incorrigible lying US media don't get is that American involvement in Syria has been a criminal enterprise from the get-go, constituting a monumental crime against peace and humanity. The US-sponsored terrorism in Syria has gone on for far too long. No amount of sanitizing by the media can alter that brutal truth.

It was Russia's principled decision at the end of 2015 to intervene in Syria, in accordance with international law, that began to bring the criminal conspiracy to an end. Two years on, the Syrian state is beginning to get the upper-hand over the foreign-backed militant groups that have ravaged the country. Russia's military support has been vital to that impending victory.

""The shuttering of the [CIA] program is also an acknowledgment of Washington's limited leverage and desire to remove Assad from power,"" noted the Washington Post.

In other words, begrudgingly, the US war for regime change in Syria is being acknowledged as a defeat. And it is Russia that ensured that defeat.

Since the New York Times broke the story last weekend of the meeting between Donald Trump Jr and the Russian lawyer there has been a frenzy among the anti-Trump political camp that the so-called ""Russia-gate"" affair has reached a critical moment.

Demands for impeachment have grown because, it is asserted, a member of the Trump campaign team met with a ""Kremlin-connected lawyer who had information to damage Clinton"".

If you read the story in this way then perhaps the ""smoking gun"" conclusion might be made: Trump's son, Donald Jr, responds ""I love it"" when told in an email that a Russian lawyer working for the Kremlin wants to give him information that would politically damage Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential contender against his father.

Trump Jr did indeed respond enthusiastically to the offer and the meeting did take place at Trump Tower in New York City on June 9 last year, two weeks after his father won the Republican party's nomination for president. Donald Jr earlier this week released a batch of private emails confirming those details.

Political opponents of President Trump, mainly Democrats but also Republicans, as well as prominent news media outlets, like The New York Times, Washington Post and CNN, are now saying that the meeting between Trump's son and the Russian lawyer is the ""first hard evidence"" of the alleged Russia collusion to interfere in US democracy.

However, this version of the story has a crucial fatal flaw. All the claims made to Trump Jr about the ""Kremlin-connected lawyer"" and the ""Russian government wanting to help Trump get elected"" are deeply suspect. The grandiose claims were made by a former British tabloid journalist named Rob Goldstone who appears to be acquainted with Trump Jr.

Goldstone, who works as a publicist and an entertainments manager, wrote to Trump Jr to set up a meeting with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya. The lawyer was acting for the family of Russian pop star Emin Agalarov.

It turns out that the Russian lawyer wanted to meet the Trump campaign to make legitimate representations about US legislation known as the Magnitsky Act (2010), which has sanctioned several Russian individuals and business people over alleged human rights abuses.

Natalia Veselnitskaya, the attorney, has this week told US media that this was the sole subject of the meeting with the Trump campaign, and that she was not acting on behalf of the Russian government, but rather in a private professional capacity. She also said that she never had any intention to discuss Hillary Clinton with Trump Jr. As far as she was concerned, the meeting was only about issues related to the Magnitsky Act.

The Kremlin has confirmed that Veselnitskaya does not work for the Russian government. In fact, the Kremlin said it was not even aware of her legal practice.

Trump Jr also confirmed in subsequent media interviews that his meeting with Veselnitskaya was an anti-climax. He says he heard ""nothing"" about Clinton from the Russian lawyer, whom he said wanted to talk about Magnitsky issues. ""I realized that this was the real purpose for the meeting,"" said Trump Jr.

That means that Trump Jr was misled by the music publicist Rob Goldstone. For whatever reason, Goldstone embellished the nature of the forthcoming meeting with the lawyer as being about juicy political gossip to help the Trump election campaign.

In other words, the former tabloid hack was putting his own spin on the matter by claiming that the lawyer was ""Kremlin-connected"" and was conveying ""information from the Russian government to damage Clinton in order to help Trump's election"".

The lawyer for the family of Emin Agalarov, the Russian singer who asked Goldstone to set up the meeting between Trump Jr and Veselnitskaya, has now come out to rubbish the claims made by Goldstone.

""The vast majority of what Rob Goldstone said in email exchange with Donald Trump Jr is not accurate,"" Agalarov's family attorney, Scott Balber, told RT. ""The only thing that's true is that Emin asked the meeting to be arranged. The rest of it is not true, it's false.""

So there you have it. It appears that the US media frenzy this week about obtaining a ""smoking gun"" implicating Trump in collusion with the Russian government to subvert the American presidential election is yet another over-the-top sensation with little factual basis.

Simply put, the Russian government was not involved in US election interference, as the Kremlin has maintained all along.

What the US media are basing their latest collusion allegations on are merely claims made by a former British tabloid hack and pop star publicist who would have had self-serving reasons to ham up the ""goods"" in order to sell Trump Jr a scoop.

This would not be the first time that the Russia-gate affair has relied on dodgy information from a dubious British source. Recall that the ""dirty dossier"" was authored by former British MI6 spy Christopher Steele, who made outlandish claims that the Kremlin had ""Kompromat"" on Donald Trump Sr from hotel orgies with Russian prostitutes.

Granted, one could censure Donald Trump Jr for being willing to receive information from what he believed to be Russian government sources to take down Clinton. But, hey come on, that's politics and the dirty business of ""opposition research"" which all parties engage in. It's impossibly naive and self-righteous to pummel Trump Jr over it.

Anyway, the salient fact remains that there was no such transfer of information from the Russian government to the Trump campaign. The US media are once again going off on a tangent, chasing their tails and tilting at windmills.

To make a grandstanding big deal about Trump Jr's conduct is the height of hypocrisy, especially in light of Hillary Clinton's campaign having commissioned the British ex-spy Christopher Steele to dig dirt on Trump Sr, as reported by award-winning investigative journalist Robert Parry.

The whole ""Russia-gate"" affair is a wild fiction dreamt up by powerful American elements who frankly refuse to abide by democracy. To make things worse, Russia is embroiled as a villain in the piece, which ensures US-Russia bilateral relations deteriorate to dangerous levels of hostility, where even the breakout of war has become a real possibility.

Washington and the US media have been in thrall to this fantasy for the past seven months, and yet still no evidence has been unearthed to justify the squandering of taxpayer money and paralysis of American government. It's not Russia that is undermining US democracy. It is Americans themselves.

Meanwhile, the White House issued a statement hailing the two-hour discussion (four times longer than originally scheduled) between the two leaders as a good start to working together on major world problems.

“No problems were solved. Nobody expected any problems to be solved in that meeting. But it was a beginning of a dialogue on some tough problem sets that we’ll begin now to work on together,” said HR McMaster, Trump’s top national security adviser.

Trump deserves credit for the way he conducted himself. He met Putin on equal terms and with respect. “It’s an honor to meet you,” said the American president as he extended a handshake.

The much-anticipated encounter comes nearly seven months after Trump was inaugurated in the White House. Over that period, large sections of the US media have run an unrelenting campaign accusing Trump of being a Russian stooge and alleging that Putin ordered an interference operation in last year’s US election to benefit Trump.

Apart from innuendo and anonymous US intelligence claims, recycled endlessly by dutiful news organizations, there is no evidence of either Trump-Russia collusion or Putin-sanctioned cyber hacking . Trump has dismissed the claims as “fake news”, while Moscow has consistently rejected the allegations as baseless Russophobia.

Against this toxic background of anti-Russian propaganda, President Trump met Putin at the weekend. The two men were due to talk face-to-face for 30 minutes. As it turned out, their discussions went on for two hours. They reportedly exchanged views on pressing matters of Syria, Ukraine and North Korea among other things. Trump brought up the issue of alleged Russian meddling in the US elections, and Putin responded in detail to assure his American counterpart it was a fabricated brouhaha in which Russia had nothing to do with it.

Only days before the big meeting, US media editorialists and pundits were warning Trump to confront Putin in an aggressive manner. The Washington Post, one of the leading anti-Russia voices, exhorted Trump to rap Putin on “US election meddling” as if the claim was a proven fact. It also urged the president to give notice to Putin that Russia had to accede to regime change in Syria. It was a get-tough order.

To his credit, Trump did not allow the Russophobia in the US media to influence his manner with Putin. He was cordial, respectful and open to listening to the Russian viewpoint on a range of issues. So much so that it appears both leaders have agreed to work together going forward.

The question now is: what next? Trump and Putin have evidently got off to a good start despite the inordinate delay and toxic background. But what does Trump’s willingness to engage positively with Moscow actually mean in practice?

© REUTERS/ Steffen Kugler/Courtesy of Bundesregierung Political Knockout: Western Media Blasts Trump After Meeting With Putin

The US Deep State comprising the military-intelligence nexus and their political, media machine in Washington does not want to normalize relations with Russia. Russian independence as a powerful foreign state under President Putin is a problem that rankles US global ambitions. That’s why the Deep State wanted anti-Russia hawk Hillary Clinton to win the election. Trump’s victory upset their calculations.

Under immense pressure, Trump has at times appeared to buckle to the US political establishment with regard to projecting hostility towards Russia, as seen in the prosecution of the covert war in Syria and renewed sanctions on Moscow.

The day before he met Putin in Germany, Trump was in Poland where he delivered a barnstorming speech in Warsaw in which he accused Russia of “destabilizing countries”, among other topics. The American president also inferred that Russia was undermining “Western civilization”. It was provocative speech bordering on hackneyed Russophobia. It did not bode well for his imminent meeting with Putin. A clash seemed to be coming, just as the US media had been cajoling.

However, the meeting the next day with Putin was surprisingly congenial. And the substance of discussions indicates a genuine desire from both sides to cooperate.

It is good that both presidents have struck up a rapport and personal understanding. Nevertheless, it is important to not bank too much on that.

Immediately following the constructive meeting between the leaders, the US media started cranking up the Russophobia again. The US media are vents for Deep State hostility towards Trump and his agenda for normalizing relations with Moscow.

The New York Times reported another breathless story about Trump’s election campaign having contact with “Kremlin-connected” people. CNN ran opinion pieces on how the president had fallen into a trap laid by Putin.

It is hard to stomach this outlandish confabulation that passes for journalism. And it is astounding that a friendly meeting between leaders of nuclear powers should not be received as a good development.

But it shows that Trump his up against very powerful deep forces within the US establishment who do not want a normalization with Russia. The US Deep State depends on confrontation, war and endless militarism for its existence. It also wants a world populated by vassals over which US corporations have suzerainty. An independent Russia or China or any other foreign power cannot be tolerated because that upends American ambitions for unipolar hegemony.

Trump’s encounter with Putin was commendable because he did not succumb to toxic Russophobia and adopt a stupid, mindless tough-guy posture. Instead, Trump reached out to Putin in a genuine way, as two human beings should do.

The US Deep State is not about humanity or understanding. It is about maintaining perceived dominance over other humans, where anyone seen to be an obstacle is disposed of in the most ruthless way.

President John F Kennedy was assassinated in broad daylight by the US Deep State because he dared to seek a normalization and peaceful coexistence with Moscow. The Deep State does not want normalization or peace with Russia or anyone else for that matter because there are too many lucrative vested interests in maintaining the war machine that is American capitalism.

This is not to predict a violent demise for Trump. The Deep State has other methods, such as the orchestration of media and other dirty tricks.

Trump’s friendly overtures to Russia are at least a promising sign. But given the power structure of the US, and its incorrigible belligerence, it is doubtful that Trump will be allowed to go beyond promises. If he attempts to, we can expect the dark forces to step up.

What needs to change is the US power structure through a democratic revolt. Until that happens, any president in the White House is simply a hostage to the dark forces of the Deep State.

It's revealing to compare the stories that have made the headlines in the western media in the first six months of 2017, with those that haven't.

There's been saturation coverage of alleged Russian interference in the US presidential election — and Russian state ""hacking"" in general — even though no hard evidence of these activities has yet been produced.

The ""threat"" posed to us all by ""the rogue state"" of North Korea has also been a regular headliner.

While in April, the ""big story"" was of a chemical weapons attack in Syria — which was blamed very quickly on the Syrian government, even though its guilt was unproven.

By contrast these very important stories below received nowhere near the same amount of coverage they should have.

The World's Biggest Humanitarian Crisis Since WWII

No, it's not in Syria, but in Yemen. In March, the UN warned that up to 20 million people were at risk of starvation and famine in Yemen, Somalia, South Sudan and Nigeria — with two-thirds of the population of Yemen needing assistance. In June, the World Health Organization said that 1,310 people had died in a cholera epidemic in Yemen and warned that 300,000 people could be infected by the end of August.

© AP Photo/ Hani Mohammed A man center, holds house destroyed by a Saudi-led airstrikes in outskirts of Sanaa, Yemen, Thursday, Feb. 16, 2017.

Yemen has been bombed for the past two years by staunch western-ally Saudi Arabia, with US and UK not only providing the weaponry, but logistic support. The ""humanitarian interventionists"" in the western media meanwhile keep schtum. The ""responsibility to protect,"" it seems, does not apply to civilians in Yemen.

The Yemen situation is very quiet also. Im assuming it is because the damage is being done by UK weapons via Saudi — Steven o' Scotland (@StevenOScotland) July 3, 2017​

'Liberated' Afghanistan in Flames

When the country was ""liberated"" by the US-led coalition in 2001, there was wall-to-wall coverage. But sixteen years on, the war not only continues but has intensified.

The Taliban, whose defeat was toasted sixteen years ago, now controls between 30-50% of the country. Daesh also has an increasing presence.

There's been a big spike in terror attacks in 2017, with 90 killed in one incident in Kabul in May — and over fifty killed in separate attacks across the country a week earlier.

© REUTERS/ Mohammad Ismail Afghan policemen inspect at the site of a blast in Kabul, Afghanistan May 31, 2017

But this isn't news, or at least not big news, on a par with ""Russian hacking."" The ""liberators"" of Afghanistan are too busy trying to ""liberate"" Syria.

Almost Half a Million Refugees to Their Homes in Syria

Yes, that's right, refugees are returning to Syria. The UNHCR says that almost 500,000 have gone back to their homes so far in 2017. But they're returning to areas which are under government-control or liberated from anti-government ""rebels,"" which rather goes against the official narrative that they were fleeing the Syrian government, doesn't it?

USUK media for years claimed Syria refugees 'fleeing Assad'. Yet with rebels now gone, already 500,000 have returnedhttps://t.co/YSP0oJL5jh — Charles Shoebridge (@ShoebridgeC) June 30, 2017​

So, in the legendary words of Leslie Nielsen in Naked Gun, it's a case of:

""Alright, nothing to see here, please disperse!""

Israel's Airstrikes on Forces in Syria Fighting al-Qaeda/Daesh/al-Nusra

Israel's been bombing Syria quite a lot in 2017. But it hasn't been targeting ISIS/Daesh or al-Qaeda affiliates, the sort of groups which carried out or inspired terror attacks against European civilians in Europe the past year, but the forces fighting ISIS/Daesh and al-Qaeda affiliates.

The strikes have been widely reported in the Israeli media, but the role of Israel in effectively strengthening the position of Daesh/al-Qaeda in Syria, hasn't received much — if any — real coverage in western countries.

Again, Leslie Nielsen and that famous Naked Gun scene springs readily to mind.

2017: Likely to Be the Fourth Consecutive Hottest Year in History

Trump's Paris climate accord pull-out made headlines, but apart from that there's been nowhere near enough coverage of the fact that that the planet continues to get hotter — and the dangers that poses to life on earth.

In March, the World Meteorological Organization warned that we were entering ""truly uncharted territory.""

Just a few days ago, temperatures in the Iranian city of Ahvaz reached a mind-boggling 54 degrees Celsius — the hottest temperature ever recorded in June in mainland Asia.

May 2017 was the second warmest May in 137 years of modern record-keeping: https://t.co/pWawcMLk1q pic.twitter.com/NXoszHnkp8 — NASA GISS (@NASAGISS) June 15, 2017​

May 2017 meanwhile, was the second hottest since records began.

But hey, let's focus instead on UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn meeting with some guys from Sinn Fein thirty years ago, shall we? That's far more important.

UK State Collusion With Radical Islamic Jihadists

The terrorist attacks in the UK in the spring of 2017 of course made the headlines, but what wasn't up for discussion was the role the UK government and MI5/6 had played in cultivating and colluding with extremist groups — like the LIFG (Libyan Islamic Fighting Group) which Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi was associated with.

""Critical questions — such as why the security service MI5 maintained terrorist 'assets' in Manchester and why the government did not warn the public of the threat in their midst — remain unanswered,"" wrote John Pilger.

Abedi/father fought for #Libya LIFG in 2011. UK worked alongside Libyan Islamists at this time, probably LIFG. https://t.co/MneebE4Yga https://t.co/qtq2pX9nbC — Mark Curtis (@markcurtis30) May 27, 2017​

""The 'smoking gun' is that when Theresa May was Home Secretary, LIFG jihadists were allowed to travel unhindered across Europe and encouraged to engage in 'battle': first to remove Muammar Gaddafi in Libya, then to join al-Qaeda affiliated groups in Syria.""

It was a ""smoking gun"" that major western news outlets conveniently chose not to notice.

The Multiple Terror Attacks in Pakistan

Like neighboring Afghanistan, Pakistan has seen a big spike in terrorism in 2017 — and like Afghanistan — it hasn't made the headlines.

In January, 25 people were killed when a vegetable market was bombed in Parachinar.

In February, at least 88 were killed in a suicide bomb attack on a shrine in Sehwan.

There has been attacks every couple of days in Pakistan with many dead and injured. No coverage here of that either. — Grace Murphy (@GraceMurphy2) July 2, 2017​

Last week (end of June) another 75 people lost their lives in market bombings in Parachinar.

The attacks have received scant coverage. And — guess what — the Eiffel Tower's lights weren't switched off, nor were its colors changed to the Pakistan flag, in solidarity.

Pakistani victims of terrorism are, like Syrians, ""unpeople"" for western media ""humanitarians.""

The Conflict and Chaos in 'Liberated' Libya

There have been heavy battles in Tripoli as rival factions fight for control of the Libyan capital.

Meanwhile, slave markets have returned to the country which had the Highest Human Development Index in Africa just eight years ago.

Libya is a failed state — transformed by NATO into a jihadist theme park. But let's ignore the North African hell-hole shall we, and make the case for further western ""liberal interventions"" against states with the ""wrong"" governments.

Daesh Hits Iran

Yes, that‘s right. Iran, the country we're told ad nauseam is the ""world's greatest sponsor of terrorism"" was hit by deadly terror attacks on its Parliament and at the shrine of Ayatollah Khomeini.

© AP Photo/ Ebrahim Noroozi Police officers control the scene, around of shrine of late Iranian revolutionary founder Ayatollah Khomeini, after an assault of several attackers in Tehran, just outside Tehran, Iran, Wednesday, June 7, 2017

ISIS/Daesh — the same group that's been targeting civilians in Europe — claimed responsibility, but highlighting how the world's worst terror group and Iran are enemies contradicts the official narrative about Iran, doesn't it?

So let's move on to another story, pretty damn quickly.

Upsurge in Violence in Congo

Thousands have been killed in recent months in the African state and more than a million have been displaced over the last year. But rather like the war between 1998-2003 which is thought to have cost the lives of over 5 million people, it's had nowhere near the same level of media coverage as the conflict in Syria.

""I can't say that the Congolese, we are in control of our destiny. No, because the ones who benefit from our minerals are not the local population, but western countries are the ones who are taking everything. They make themselves rich, while we are getting poorer and poorer,"" a Congolese, Bernard Kalume Buleri, told a new RT documentary.

Would we be hearing more about the desperate plight of the people in Congo if western countries weren't ""taking everything""?

I'll let you make your own mind up.

Before the Riyadh coup, an insistent narrative had been pervading selected Middle East geopolitical circles according to which US intel, “indirectly”, stopped another coup against the young Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim al-Thani, orchestrated by Mohammad bin Zayed, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, with help from Blackwater/Academi's Eric Prince’s army of mercenaries in the UAE. Zayed, crucially, happens to be MBS’s mentor.

Our source clarifies, “the events are connected. Prince is CIA, but he probably stopped any coup attempt on Qatar. The CIA blocked the coup in Qatar and the Saudis reacted by dumping the CIA selected Mohammed bin Nayef, who was to be the next King. The Saudis are scared. The monarchy is in trouble as the CIA can move the army in Saudi Arabia against the king. This was a defensive move by MBS.”

The source adds, “MBS is failing everywhere. Yemen, Syria, Qatar, Iraq, etc. are all failures of MBS. China is also displeased with MBS as he has been stirring up trouble in Xinjiang. Russia cannot be happy that MBS was and is behind the lower oil price. Who are his allies? He has only one and that is his father, who is hardly competent.” King Salman is virtually incapacitated by dementia.

The source is adamant that, “it is very possible the CIA will move against the monarchy in Saudi Arabia.” That would qualify as the war between President Trump and selected sectors of the US deep state reaching a whole new level.

And to add to the charade, there’s the Jared of Arabia factor. There's no way any serious inside player would confirm anything about the (aborted) coup in Qatar. But if that coup attempt really happened, and was squashed, Jared Kushner may have had inside information, considering his connections.

According to the source, “Jared Kushner is essentially bankrupt at 666 Fifth Avenue, and needs Saudi financial help. So he is doing everything the Saudis want. 666 Fifth is in such bad financial shape that even his father-in-law cannot bail him out.”

Operation Desert Hubris

This convoluted trail of events does corroborate the famous December 2015 memo by the BND – German intelligence, according to which the House of Saud had adopted “an impulsive policy of intervention”, with then Defense Minister and Deputy Crown Prince MBS, a “gambler”, bound to cause a lot of trouble.

The BND memo detailed how the House of Saud, in Syria, bankrolled the creation of the Army of Conquest – basically a revamp of Jabhat al-Nusra, a.k.a. al-Qaeda in Syria — as well as ideological sister outfit Ahrar al-Sham. Translation; the House of Saud aiding, abetting and weaponizing Salafi-jihadi terrorism. And this from a regime that now charges Qatar of doing the same (Doha supported different outfits).

In Yemen, the BND worried that MBS’s war against the Houthis and the Yemeni Army was only profiting al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Now MBS’s war – conducted with American and British weapons — has also provoked a horrendous humanitarian catastrophe.

How come an arrogant, sloppy, hubristic ignoramus like MBS has come so close to set the whole of Southwest Asia on fire? And not only Southwest Asia; waves of despair are flowing in Western investment circles to the effect that MBS is such a loose cannon his actions will destroy retirement accounts all over the spectrum.

Some essential background is in order. What we have today is the Third Saudi kingdom — founded by Ibn Saud in 1902, keeping the same, previous noxious alliance with troglodyte Wahhabi clerics. Ibn Saud only ruled Najd in the beginning; then, in 1913, he annexed Shi’ite Eastern Arabia (that’s where the oil is), and up to 1926 Hejaz, on the Red Sea coast. A “united” Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was proclaimed only in 1932.

Ibn Saudi died in 1953. Arguably the most influential of his harem of wives was Hassa al-Sudairi. They had 7 sons together. (Demented) King Salman, Nayef and MBS are all Sudairis. MBS is the first of Ibn Saud’s grandsons within striking reach of the throne.

Quite a few other princes are more competent that MBS. Nayef, who spent a long time in the Interior Ministry, was the Saudi counterterrorism czar (thus being a CIA darling). There’s Mitab bin Abdullah, minister of the Saudi Arabian National Guard; notorious Prince Turki, former intel chief, former ambassador to the US, and former best pal of Osama bin Laden; and Khaled bin Faisal, governor of Mecca and former education minister.

Take the risible list of 13 demands now imposed on Qatar – that’s MBS’s work – including the bellicose virtual excommunication of Iran and shutting down al-Jazeera.

No wonder every major geopolitical player is now gaming war scenarios – although only Germany stated its concerns on the record. Qatar is a NATO observer. Doha is adamant; it won’t fold to the absurd Saudi demands.

The theme of economic sanctions against Russia and especially against its region of Crimea is becoming a real bonanza for lawyers. First, the US Senate tried to introduce the legislation that would make president Trump's administration incapable of lifting the sanctions on Russia. Thanks to some pressure from Germany and other EU member states, the Senate bill has been stopped: the German foreign minister and the Austrian chancellor said that the bill had not been coordinated with the EU and could harm the German and Austrian energy supplies from Russia

However, the EU did not trail far behind the US with its own share of ""sanctions craze."" The European Council announced on Friday that the EU would extend anti-Russian sanctions for six months more. Ukraine, from its side, though not yet a member of the European Union, has already outdone all of its European neighbors in introducing the most sophisticated sanctions against its former region of Crimea. Ukraine's president Petro Poroshenko recently announced new sanctions targeting individual sanatoriums in Crimea, there are Ukrainian sanctions aimed at seizing the property of Crimean officials in Ukraine, etc.

Cash Withdrawals Made Possible

Russia's top leadership keeps saying that Western sanctions are regrettable, but they won't make Russia give up Crimea, as Mr. Poroshenko is demanding. But how are all of these sanctions viewed ""on the ground"" — inside Crimea itself? A brief trip to Crimea in June 2017 made me understand: Crimea wants to be a part of the ""bigger world,"" but only together with Russia.

…Changes are apparent already inside the small airport in Simferopol (the capital of Crimea): unlike in 2016, it is possible to use Russian credit cards and withdraw cash using the international paying systems.

""We have been working on that and we have made cash withdrawals possible,"" said Andrei Melnikov, the minister of economic development of the Republic of Crimea — now the ""youngest"" region of the Russian Federation. ""You will feel quite at home here with your VISA or Master Card.""

The only difference from other Russian regions was that people withdrew cash not from the familiar Sberbank's green cash machines, but from the black cash machines of some other banks. Sberbank, apparently, decided not to subject itself to Western ire. Western visitors of Crimea, however, show more understanding for Crimea's plight than the EU officials.

""People who know the history of Crimea and Russia were not surprised by what happened here in 2014, when Crimea became a part of Russia again,"" explains the head of the parliamentary committee for international relations of the Republic of Cyprus, Georgios Lillikas, speaking to reporters at the recent International Economic Forum in Yalta. ""I believe sanctions are not here for duration, the problem will be resolved via political dialogue. History taught us that.""

How Did We Get There?

Crimea's history is indeed a troubled one. The Republic of Crimea, which is located on the ancient Crimean peninsula, has been a part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic inside the Soviet Union in 1954-1991 and a region inside independent Ukraine in 1991-2014. After the referendum held in the aftermath of the violent regime change in Ukraine in the early 2014, Crimea came back to Russia, whose part it had been since the 1780s. Western sanctions on companies doing business in Crimea followed instantly, with numerous other limitations. For example, foreign embassies continued viewing Crimea as still a part of Ukraine, so Crimeans had difficulty getting their visas for foreign travel. In another EU-approved move, the supposedly ""Western liberal"" Ukrainian authorities declared ""persona non grata"" any Russian artist or singer who performed or exhibited his works in ""occupied"" Crimea, sometimes extending the prohibition to visitors from third countries too.

Reactions of the People

So, people in Crimea do have some ground for comparisons — with both old and new times. And what are the voices of the people from the land — don't they want to get back to Ukraine, as the EU and the US insist they should? In order to find out the truth I talked not only to ethnic Russians, who make up a 68 percent majority of the Crimean population, but also to the local minorities — Crimean Tatars, Jews and Greeks.

""What do you think I am — an idiot? To want Crimea go back to Ukraine?"" Mikhail Degtyar, a 62 years old Crimean-born Jew and a television reporter, now sharing his time between Moscow and Crimea, is visibly emotional. ""When the so called Ukrainian activists cut all electricity supplies to Crimea in the winter of 2016, women who were giving birth at the local maternity clinics were dying because the lights went off everywhere. Am I supposed to approve that? I have nothing against the Ukrainian people, but I don't want to live under a regime where such so called popular actions are permitted to happen.""

Officially, the Ukrainian government did not approve of the actions of the ultra-right organizations which in autumn 2015 blew up the electricity lines connecting the Kherson region of Ukraine to ""energetically insufficient"" Crimea, plunging the peninsula into darkness. But the Ukrainian authorities did not do anything to remove the violent ""civic activists"" who prevented the lines from being repaired, beating and insulting the repair teams. These Ukrainian ""civic activists"" in that memorable 2015 included not only the veterans of the neo-Nazi Azov battalion and the Right Sector group, made infamous by their suppression of the population of Donbass. Electricity line poles were exploded and workers prevented from repairing them also by the activists of the Mejlis of Crimean Tatar People, an organization banned in Crimea but lionized in the West as ""the true representatives of the Crimean Tatar people.""

As a result, Crimea restored its electricity supplies only in spring 2016 thanks to the construction of ""energy bridge"" with Russia, built under President Putin's personal supervision.

Between Two Motherlands

Zaur Smirnov, currently the head of Crimea's State Committee for Interethnic Relations, was a member of the Presidium of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People when Crimea was a part of Ukraine, but he broke with that organization when it ""turned against its own people,"" in Zaur Smirnov's own words.

""I am a Crimean Tatar and I was a member of the Mejlis under Ukraine, because I wanted to serve my people,"" Zaur Smirnov said at a meeting with the members of Russia's Azerbaijani community in Simferopol, the capital of Crimea. ""But when the Mejlis tried to leave us without light and water, how could I react? When the Mejlis' leader Mustafa Djemilev started talking about sending armed kamikazes to Crimea from neighboring Ukrainian regions — what could my attitude be, except for a very negative one? If Mejlis' leaders continue considering themselves citizens of Ukraine, let them live in Ukraine. The Mejlis' top leadership — they all have homes in Ukraine, they have been for a long time living off the grants from the Western organizations which helped the ruling regime in Kiev seize power in 2014. Let them live with the regime they helped to install. I want to live in Crimea, with my people. Thanks to Crimea's reunification with Russia, the Tatar language is now one of the three state languages of Crimea (Russian, Tatar and Ukrainian). We could never get this kind of language legislation under Ukraine.""

In Ukraine, there is only one state language — Ukrainian. Russian and other minority languages are struggling for at best a regional status, which had been guaranteed to them by a special law adopted under former president Viktor Yanukovych, ousted by Maidan protest insurgency in 2014. One of the main slogans of the anti-Yanukovych protests in 2013-2014, actively supported by the US and the EU, was the cancellation of the law on regional status for minority languages. So much for Western support to language diversity.

The Good Side of Not Travelling

Most of Crimea's government members are under Western sanctions, but the head of the Republic of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, thinks that personal sanctions might also have a positive effect: the local officials, most of whom started their careers under corrupt Ukrainian presidents, are simply forced to stop thinking about foreign banks accounts and real estate in Europe. ""Instead, they will finally concentrate on making their own neighborhoods beautiful,"" said former prosecutor general of Crimea Natalya Poklonskaya, a young woman popularly considered to be the prettiest victim of Western sanctions, currently working as a Russian State Duma deputy in Moscow.

That logic might work: since 2014, not a single official in Crimea had an international search warrant issued on him after making it off with public money (a very common phenomenon in independent Ukraine). During the same period, according to Crimea's head Sergei Aksyonov, Crimean economy expanded, since the Russian-speaking peninsula was no longer discriminated against.

""When Crimea was under Ukraine, the budget of our autonomous republic was limited to 22 billion rubles ($0.37 billion) in the best of times between 1991 and 2014,"" Aksyonov said at the international forum ""Open Crimea by One's Own Eyes"" held in Crimea in mid-June 2017. ""In 2016, we collected in Crimea 40 billion rubles ($0.67) in taxes plus we get an annual investment of about $1.67 billion for our infrastructure, mostly from the federal budget of Russia.""

Industries Revived

Pretty figures do not always reflect the dire realities of individual citizens' lives, but the interviewed Crimeans seem to agree: there are definitely more employment opportunities under Russian rule, pensions and salaries grew. There are significant improvements in infrastructure: new roads, a bridge connecting the peninsula to ""continental"" Russia is being in the final stages of its construction.

""Under Ukraine, we were scrambling to make a niche for ourselves at the overseas markets, but we were still losing workplaces,"" says Alexander Batalin, the director general of the ""Fiolent"" industrial plant in Simferopol, specializing in the production of high precision industrial equipment. ""Now 90 percent of our products go to the Russian market, and we already have orders for the next year which are several times more lucrative than at any period of our life under independent Ukraine.""

According to Batalin, Fiolent set itself the aim of filling 10 percent of the Russian market of high precision machinery. ""We have to make it since the markets of Ukraine and the EU are not accessible to us,"" Batalin explains. ""But if we achieve this goal, this will allow us not only to maintain our personnel of 1.6 thousand people, but even to expand.""

Champagne for Sanctions

Alexander Zhukov, the chief specialist at Massandra winery, the famous Crimean wine-making plant whose roots date back to the tsarist times of the late 19century, also says that sanctions do not bother him as long as the Russian market stays open. ""We have 144 million people in Russia, tens of millions of them are familiar with the product of our winery, this will allow us to survive,"" Zhukov explains. ""As for more distant future, our plant and its vineyards were created in the late nineteenth century by prince Lev Golitsyn, who made wine supplies to the court of emperor Nicholas II. So, connoisseurs not only in Russia, but also abroad had the time to taste and appreciate our wines. They will want OUR wines more and more.""

When Massandra, complete with its vineyards and famous 19th century wine cellars was included in the sanctions lists of both the EU and Ukraine, Yanina Pavlenko, Massandra's director general, celebrated this fact with the introduction of a new line of sparkling wines (popularly called ""shampanskoye"" — from the French ""champagne"" — in Russian).

""I am proud to be in America's list of personal sanctions,"" Yanina Pavlenko said in an interview to RIA Novosti news agency. ""Despite all of this pressure, Massandra continues to take part in international wine competitions, and we get prizes there. This is the main thing for us. As for vacationing, I can enjoy it in Crimea. Meanwhile, California, wait for me.""

So much for the Western sanctions and their ""crippling"" effect on Russian psyche.

""Instead, they will finally concentrate on making their own neighborhoods beautiful,"" said former prosecutor general of Crimea Natalya Poklonskaya, a young woman popularly considered to be the prettiest victim of Western sanctions, currently working as a Russian State Duma deputy in Moscow.

That logic might work: since 2014, not a single official in Crimea had an international search warrant issued on him after making it off with public money (a very common phenomenon in independent Ukraine). During the same period, according to Crimea's head Sergei Aksyonov, Crimean economy expanded, since the Russian-speaking peninsula was no longer discriminated against.

""When Crimea was under Ukraine, the budget of our autonomous republic was limited to 22 billion rubles ($0.37 billion) in the best of times between 1991 and 2014,"" Aksyonov said at the international forum ""Open Crimea by One's Own Eyes"" held in Crimea in mid-June 2017. ""In 2016, we collected in Crimea 40 billion rubles ($0.67) in taxes plus we get an annual investment of about $1.67 billion for our infrastructure, mostly from the federal budget of Russia.""

Industries Revived

Pretty figures do not always reflect the dire realities of individual citizens' lives, but the interviewed Crimeans seem to agree: there are definitely more employment opportunities under Russian rule, pensions and salaries grew. There are significant improvements in infrastructure: new roads, a bridge connecting the peninsula to ""continental"" Russia is being in the final stages of its construction.

""Under Ukraine, we were scrambling to make a niche for ourselves at the overseas markets, but we were still losing workplaces,"" says Alexander Batalin, the director general of the ""Fiolent"" industrial plant in Simferopol, specializing in the production of high precision industrial equipment. ""Now 90 percent of our products go to the Russian market, and we already have orders for the next year which are several times more lucrative than at any period of our life under independent Ukraine.""

According to Batalin, Fiolent set itself the aim of filling 10 percent of the Russian market of high precision machinery. ""We have to make it since the markets of Ukraine and the EU are not accessible to us,"" Batalin explains. ""But if we achieve this goal, this will allow us not only to maintain our personnel of 1.6 thousand people, but even to expand.""

Champagne for Sanctions

Alexander Zhukov, the chief specialist at Massandra winery, the famous Crimean wine-making plant whose roots date back to the tsarist times of the late 19century, also says that sanctions do not bother him as long as the Russian market stays open. ""We have 144 million people in Russia, tens of millions of them are familiar with the product of our winery, this will allow us to survive,"" Zhukov explains. ""As for more distant future, our plant and its vineyards were created in the late nineteenth century by prince Lev Golitsyn, who made wine supplies to the court of emperor Nicholas II. So, connoisseurs not only in Russia, but also abroad had the time to taste and appreciate our wines. They will want OUR wines more and more.""

When Massandra, complete with its vineyards and famous 19th century wine cellars was included in the sanctions lists of both the EU and Ukraine, Yanina Pavlenko, Massandra's director general, celebrated this fact with the introduction of a new line of sparkling wines (popularly called ""shampanskoye"" — from the French ""champagne"" — in Russian).

""I am proud to be in America's list of personal sanctions,"" Yanina Pavlenko said in an interview to RIA Novosti news agency. ""Despite all of this pressure, Massandra continues to take part in international wine competitions, and we get prizes there. This is the main thing for us. As for vacationing, I can enjoy it in Crimea. Meanwhile, California, wait for me.""

So much for the Western sanctions and their ""crippling"" effect on Russian psyche.

It was a beautiful Saturday afternoon, when all of a sudden sheer horror struck flocks of tourists and business owners alike as a dark discharge invaded the area, bringing with it a putrid smell.

""I was just praying it wasn’t an oil leak,"" Pat Proctor, vice president for Rainbow Air Inc., a local helicopter tourism agency, told Buffalo News. ""It looked like something out of a sci-fi movie.""

— Maid of the Mist (@maidofthemist) July 29, 2017

​Luckily for Proctor, and dozens of others, it wasn’t an oil leak. It was a sewer discharge that came from the Niagara Falls Wastewater Treatment Plant.

Despite having the paperwork that said all signs were go on the release, it didn’t help in calming residents and owners.

""We were shocked,"" Nick Melson, a Niagara Falls city administrator, told Buffalo News. ""We were caught off guard. We had to do some digging ourselves to find out what was going on. And we were very upset that we weren’t notified.""

Not alone in their frustration, businesses like Maid of the Mist, a boating tour company, chose to vent their inquiry on Twitter.

​The Niagara Falls water board later explained that one of their sewage plant’s filtration basins had to be flushed out ahead of scheduled maintenance. While such events typically occur during the spring and fall, it couldn’t be avoided do to plant upgrades planned for Monday.

""We don’t normally do this during the tourist season,"" Rolfe Porter, water board executive director, told the paper.

Though the sight and smell lingered for hours it eventually dissipated overnight and was fully gone by 8:00 a.m., reported Melson.

The sewage discharge doesn’t normally change the color of the water, but Porter indicated the water had an altered color due to the sediment that was released from the bottom of the basins.

Moving forward, officials say they will work to better inform the community of any further work in the future in the hopes of easing concerns."

Recent studies in the US and the UK claim that spending time at the beach improves happiness, well-being and even mental acuity, possibly explaining why Hawaiian residents have consistently been ranked by six consecutive Gallup polls as the happiest people in America by state, according to news.com.au.

To add weight to a claim that probably needs no proving, research by Japan's Kobe University observed that those who live in a place with a view of the ocean are more relaxed than those who do not.

These ever-so-evident research results are mirrored by additional evidence posted to Sciencedirect.com, claiming that UK citizens who live by an ocean claim to have a higher quality of physical and mental health than those who live inland, particularly in deep urban enclaves.

Decades of scientific research has shown that seawater helps the physical body to fight infection, as it contains magnesium, potassium and iodine — just three of a large number of minerals that are beneficial to the human organism in moderate external doses.

As if the saltwater's balm is not enough, the sea air has long been known to provide benefits to the respiratory system that improve sleep, according to the post.

During a conversation about the positive mental and physical effects of a body's proximity to the sea, clinical psychologist Richard Shuster remarked that the relaxed calm kindled by several hours on a beach is not just due to all that sunlight-induced vitamin D, cited by NBC.

""The color blue has been found by an overwhelming amount of people to be associated with feelings of calm and peace,"" Shuster said, suggesting that staring at the ever-changing ocean causes a meditative state, shifting brain wave frequency.

The sound of ocean waves ""de-stimulates our brains,"" Shuster offered, cited by news.com.au.

As even the feeling of sand between one's toes is is well-known to be pleasurable and healthy, Shuster asserted that the oceanic calm one gains at the beach can be recreated in a meditative practice — one that only gains in value by actually being there.

""Focus on how your body feels warm from the rays of the sun,"" he said, ""focus on what it feels like to have your feet in the sand, breathe deep and smell the ocean air.""

How far are you from an ocean? Probably not so far that the benefits of being there are outweighed by the hassle of preparation, travel, and putting on all that sunscreen.

But you don't need to pay a clinical psychologist to tell you that."

Honolulu Police to Fine Those Caught Texting in a Crosswalk,[],"A pedestrian staring into the screen of a handheld device while traversing a busy street is an obvious urban deathwish, and the city of Honolulu, Hawaii, has now made this dangerous behavior a misdemeanor - with fines attached.

Intended to prevent the oblivious from becoming another statistic, the new law will go into effect in October according to local government, and fines will be leveled against those who cross ""a street or highway while viewing a mobile electronic device,"" cited by the Verge.

At a public announcement staged at one of the city's busiest intersections, Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell stated that the new law was intended to remind pedestrians to ""use common sense as they walk around this beautiful city,"" as well as making sure that ""they don't become another statistic.""

""We hold the unfortunate distinction of being a major city with more pedestrians being hit in crosswalks, particularly our seniors, than almost any other city in the county,"" Caldwell said.

According to a University of Maryland study, between 2000-2011 more than 11,000 people in the US sustained injuries as a direct result of being distracted by a handheld device while walking.

The tropical island city is now the largest urban center in the US to implement laws against being distracted in crosswalks by devices, including cell phones, text messaging devices, pagers, PDAs, laptops, video games or cameras, according to the Verge.

The new law, which goes into effect October 25, will see fines of $15-$35 for a first offense, $35-$75 if a second offense occurs within a year, and $75-$99 for a third time within that same year.

The practice of listening to audio devices is exempt from the ban, as are those who can prove that they were making a telephone call to emergency services at the time of their citation.

As with many other states, Hawaii also has banned the use of handheld devices while operating a motor vehicle.

Those complaining of lawmaker overreach have criticized the new bill.

According to a recent editorial in The Star, legislators involved in crafting and passing the bill were depicted as ""exasperated parents telling foolish children to not do stupid things that tempt death,"" adding that human stupidity is omnipresent, with or without laws."

The move by Saudi Arabia and three allied Arab countries to break off diplomatic relations with Qatar is rooted in ideological and economic questions, including plans for a new gas pipeline, Mohammad Sadeq Jukar, expert in energy politics at the Iranian Energy Ministry's Strategic Research Center, told Sputnik Iran.

Since breaking off diplomatic relations in June, Riyadh has stopped air traffic to and from Doha and deprived its neighbor of vital imports via its only land crossing. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE had also issued a 13-point ultimatum to Qatar including demands to close the Al Jazeera broadcaster, close a Turkish military base, curb ties with Iran and end Doha's alleged support for terrorists.

Refusing to yield to the demands, Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said that they were ""made to be rejected.""

An analyst, Mohammad Sadeq Jukar, told Sputnik Iran that ideological differences between Riyadh and Qatar are one of the main sources of the conflict, as is a planned new pipeline project.

""One of the main factors in the dispute between Qatar and Saudi Arabia is their difference in ethno-confessional politics, in particular support of certain Islamic factions and groups in different countries: Turkey, Egypt, South Africa. Qatar takes an independent position of moderate Islam, which doesn't suit Saudi Arabia, propagandizing radicalism and extremism,"" Jukar explained.

While Qatar shares its only land border with Saudi Arabia, it also shares the world's largest natural gas field with Iran, located in the Persian Gulf.

In contrast to its Arab neighbor, Qatar enjoys a good relationship with Iran based on their economic cooperation, and Tehran has shipped and flown food to Qatar since Saudi Arabia's blockade began. This relationship is an example of Qatar's independence from Saudi Arabia, which wants Doha to fall in line with its foreign policy, Jukar said.

""These fundamental disagreements between Saudi Arabia and Qatar are in no way connected with Iran. To a greater degree, this is a conflict of ideological and political interests.""

""If Qatar gives in to this pressure and turns into another emirate of Saudi Arabia, the energy compass will change direction in favor of the Persian Gulf states.""

Qatar, the world's third-largest supplier of liquefied natural gas (LNG), currently supplies the UAE and Oman with natural gas via the Dolphin pipeline which runs across the Persian Gulf. Despite the UAE's sanctions against it, Doha says it has no intention of cutting the supply. According to Jukar, another factor in the dispute is the planned Dolphin 2 pipeline, which Saudi Arabia wants control over.

""The Dolphin 2 gas pipeline was being actively negotiated before the Qatari crisis began. It was planned that Qatari gas would be exported along this pipeline to the UAE. The volumes may increase, and in turn this will threaten the export of Iranian gas to the countries of the region.""

Saudi Arabia stands to gain a lot if the project goes ahead under the auspices of Riyadh rather than Doha, the Iranian analyst said.

""If Qatar gives in and resumes negotiations for this project, then Saudi Arabia wins. The planned Dolphin 2 gas pipeline will pass through disputed territory which is claimed by Saudi Arabia. In this case, Saudi Arabia may abandon ambitions it held regarding disputed territories of the Dolphin 1 project. Or, Saudi Arabia will also allow the extension of the gas pipeline to Kuwait. All this will be possible if Qatar makes concessions and gives in. In general, in this case energy cooperation between the Persian Gulf countries will only grow and develop.""

""On the other hand, the fate of the electric grid in the Persian Gulf will also become an issue. Since the Arab states of the Persian Gulf are in dire need of electricity, this project is sure to develop, and Qatar will play a paramount role. Because Saudi Arabia has a growing demand for energy, Qatar may become the main gas supplier for the Saudis in the future. So far, Saudi Arabia satisfies its electricity needs by burning its oil. In the hottest months of the year, approximately 700,000 barrels per day are used to produce energy … if the project to produce gas by nontraditional means [such as fracking of shale formations] in Saudi Arabia doesn't get off the ground then in the future it will turn into a gas importer.""

""In general, the countries that have declared a boycott on Qatar understand that putting pressure on Qatar will harm them, especially the UAE. Here, it's not only the issue that the Dolphin project will be suspended – a whole branch of gas supply may be chopped off, and this is a big loss for the UAE. The damage will cost them $2 — $2.5 billion annually. Besides, they import gas from Qatar at a very low price, and in the event of an interruption in supplies, it will be simply impossible for them to find an economically beneficial alternative,"" Jukar said."

On Sunday, Bahrain's Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmed Khalifa said that the countries blocking Qatar, namely, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, are ready for dialogue with Doha if the Qatari authorities confirm the end of their support for terrorism.

""We express our readiness for a dialogue with Qatar if it confirms the cancellation of terrorism support,"" Khalifa said at a joint press conference in Bahrain's capital Manama.

In June, the four aforementioned Arab states cut off diplomatic relations with Qatar, accusing the latter of supporting terrorism and meddling in their internal affairs. Doha has denied the accusations.

Speaking to Sputnik, Saudi expert Anwar Ishki pointed out that ""the countries blocking Qatar are doing their best to cooperate with Doha within the framework of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) without bringing the crisis to an international level.""

""To achieve this goal and prevent Qatar from supporting terrorist organizations, a spate of new economic [restrictive] measures may be used against Qatar, which may even be expelled from the GCC,"" Ishki said.

As for a possible US contribution to resolving the Qatar crisis, Ishki said that Washington had already worked out a strategy on developing relations with Qatar and that it stipulates the division of duties between responsible persons.

For example, President Donald Trump stands for taking steps to counter terrorism, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson calls for clinching agreements with Doha that will allow the US to take control of all the banking operations carried out by Qatar.

Already, the transfer of each and every riyal from Qatar is coordinated with America, according to Ishki.

After breaking off relations with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates issued an ultimatum with 13 demands to Qatar.

The document includes requests that Qatar sever its relations with Iran, close Turkey's military base in Qatar and shut down the TV channel Al Jazeera, as well as support for the Muslim Brotherhood, a terrorist organization which is banned in Russia, Egypt and elsewhere.

The new ultimatum also did not provide any fixed deadline, according to the reports. It was later reported that the list was not cut down and that a modified list of six broader principles was issued instead.

However, Bahrain's Ambassador to Russia Ahmed Saati told Sputnik on July 21, that the media reports were wrong and the four Arab countries hadn't cut back or modified the list of demands.

Deep in the Negev Desert in southern Israel a large commercial greenhouse posing as a tomato farm was actually growing a much more profitable product — marijuana. Police spent over 24 hours digging up the vast number of plants following the seizure of the facility, according to Jerusalem Online.

An estimated 13,500 living plants were uprooted and destroyed according to reports, in what has been described as one of the largest seizures of living marijuana plants — a substance recently decriminalized in Israel — in recent memory.

The seizure, on one of the many communal farming communities in the country, is predicted to bring about a shortage of the popular recreational substance, according to an assertion by an unnamed police spokesperson, cited by Jerusalem Online.

The comparative size of the haul — when balanced against the size of the country — had officials breathlessly estimating its street value at some $25 million.

Those responsible for growing what is increasingly noted by prominent medical researchers around the globe as a relatively benign material, are now the subject of a manhunt, according to Israeli police.

Although the growers managed to avoid capture, police in Israel noted that the ongoing campaign to remove the business of marijuana growing and distribution from the nation's culture would continue.

On March 5 of this year the public consumption of marijuana was decriminalized in Israel. First-time offenders will be fined $270 and four-time offenders will receive jail time.

Selling or growing pot in the country remains a criminal offense, however."

The seizure, on one of the many communal farming communities in the country, is predicted to bring about a shortage of the popular recreational substance, according to an assertion by an unnamed police spokesperson, cited by Jerusalem Online.

The comparative size of the haul — when balanced against the size of the country — had officials breathlessly estimating its street value at some $25 million.

Those responsible for growing what is increasingly noted by prominent medical researchers around the globe as a relatively benign material, are now the subject of a manhunt, according to Israeli police.

Although the growers managed to avoid capture, police in Israel noted that the ongoing campaign to remove the business of marijuana growing and distribution from the nation's culture would continue.

On March 5 of this year the public consumption of marijuana was decriminalized in Israel. First-time offenders will be fined $270 and four-time offenders will receive jail time.

Selling or growing pot in the country remains a criminal offense, however."

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — The Ukrainian government's decision to purchase American thermal coal will boost the US economy and help it establish global energy dominance, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a briefing on Monday.

""This announcement will… boost our own economy, supporting jobs in the coal and transportation industries,"" Sanders said. ""[As the Trump administration] continues to move the country down the path of energy dominance, we hope to see more mutually beneficial partnerships like these in the future.""

Earlier on Monday, Ukraine's state-owned power generation company Centrenergo PJSC announced that it would purchase American thermal coal from Xcoal Energy and Resources in the US state of Pennsylvania.

Sanders said the partnership will provide Ukraine with a secure, reliable alternative energy source ahead of the winter months.

The US company anticipates that shipments of American coal will arrive in Ukraine in late August or early September."

Beijing police said in a statement on Monday night that certain members of the company, Shanxinhui, were egged on by people with ulterior motives to participate in an illegal gathering on Monday and seriously disturb the capital's social order. Their gathering is suspected of breaking the law.

Zhang Tianming, the company's legal representative, and others have been put under ""coercive measures"" on suspicion of organizing and leading a pyramid scheme previously.

Police succeeded in persuading participants to disperse and those believed to have led the illegal gathering and refused to obey police orders have been taken away for further investigation, the statement said. ""Those who instigate or organize illegal gathering and who participate in such gathering will be punished by law,"" it said.

The Xinhua News Agency cited the Ministry of Public Security as saying on Friday that police accused Zhang and others of plotting, manipulating and persuading people into taking part in a pyramid scheme disguised as a charity for the poor, and swindled them of huge amounts of money. The ministry said pyramid schemes are often disguised as charities, false currency, e-commerce and WeChat marketing.

The opening-up of Tibet is in line with the general trend, but due to some historical and geopolitical factors, it has had to face some special challenges involving international strategy and security in the process of its development.

First, India's attitude toward the B&R is not conducive to Tibet's involvement in the initiative. Among countries and regions along the route of the B&R, India is the only large economy that has yet to express public support for the initiative. Given this situation, India is unlikely to consider building a railway linking it to the autonomous region.

Second, Sino-Indian border trade is underdeveloped, which is a serious barrier to developing Tibet's trade. More than 90 percent of trade between India and the autonomous region, which border one another, passes through the port of Tianjin in North China, which is 4,400 kilometers away.

Third, Nepal's internal politics may thwart the interconnection of the two countries' infrastructure. In contrast to what Indian media outlets have reported, Nepal does have an interest in China's B&R initiative, but the Himalayan country has misgivings about ramping up efforts to carry out the agreement reached by its former prime minister, KP Sharma Oli, who had a pro-China stance. He agreed to speed up the interconnection and strengthen cooperation with China, but this process may be held up due to India's attitude toward the B&R.

With economic integration between Tibet and the rest of China a major way for the region to play a more active role in the B&R initiative, China should create a favorable international environment for itself to speed up the interconnection with South Asian countries and make Tibet a bridgehead for that process.

First, Tibet could continue to improve its infrastructure, including roads, telecom facilities and land border ports.

Second, while setting the stage for strategic interaction with India, China should focus on cooperation with the state governments of India and major companies there. These parties are always significantly less interested in geopolitics than national governments. There is a strong desire among state governments in India to promote local economic development, while heads of local government departments care about their individual political careers relating to economic growth.

Many investment promotion delegations led by chief ministers of Indian states have visited China to attract investment, and these events offer a shortcut for the B&R initiative to establish a presence in India. China needs to strengthen cooperation with state governments in northeast India such as Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh.

Third, China should become a dependable friend of Nepal. Although political uncertainty persists, Nepal is the best option for Tibet's opening-up and interconnection with the outside. Since the early 1990s, ""striking a balance"" has been a principle of the foreign policy pursued by Nepal, on the basis of a rise in nationalism and anti-India sentiment.

Events such as an undeclared economic blockade by India, which led to shortages of fuel, medicine and other supplies in Nepal, have led most Nepali people to abandon their illusions about India. Although India maintains a considerable presence in Nepal, this does not necessarily mean that the smaller nation is unwilling to change the status quo, although its internal political disputes diminish its solidarity. China has no intention of competing with India in Nepal; rather, what China hopes to achieve is that Nepal and other neighboring countries can get a free ride on China's economic rise.

China hopes that Nepal can serve as a bridge to India, which means that China needs to speed up interconnection with Nepal first. China should strengthen cooperation with Nepal in terms of the economy and infrastructure, and enhance political and cultural exchanges.

Fourth, we must optimize local industries in Tibet to make it an important node for the B&R initiative. We should take the opportunity to promote specialized industry development, focus on improving the environment and pursue natural and cultural heritage protection.

In addition, as Tibet is close to South Asia, we may also make full use of the unique advantages of Tibet in geography and humanities to boost the local financial industry.

Finally, in participation in the B&R initiative, Tibet must pay attention to connections to people in surrounding countries and regions.

I-MILES Vehicle Tactical Engagement Simulation System (VTESS) allows commanders to simulate violent conflict via force-on-force and force-on-target training exercises with lasers and blank rounds, according to Military & Aerospace Electronics. In April, the Pentagon awarded the firm $288 million to build the system.

Lockheed is basically building a highly sophisticated laser tag game.

In inhospitable territories where a central power grid is nonexistent, the turbines are seen as an ideal, if not essential solution for the supply of electricity.

In some areas along the Russian Arctic coast, wind speeds regularly exceed 5-7 m/s, an extremely favorable indicator for the cost-effective use of wind energy.

However, the use of conventional wind turbines has been limited by the regular bursts of high wind speeds, which can damage or break wind turbine equipment. At speeds above 11 m/s, the rotors of traditional turbines risk damage, and their electric generators can overheat. Wind speeds above 25 m/s threaten to destroy the wind turbines altogether.

Russian engineers conducting tests in the Kanin Peninsula, a large Arctic territory in the Nenets Autonomous Region bordering the White and Barents Seas, have found that not a single foreign wind turbine could withstand wind speeds in local conditions. This, scientists said, was an indication that their onboard speed-limiting systems were not effective, and designed for work only in 'hothouse conditions.'

Accordingly, one of the key challenges for a team of scientists from South Ural State University in Chelyabinsk, Russia has been to come up with an effective mechanism for limiting the power sent from the turbine when wind speeds reach above 11 m/s. The team specializing in wind power has created a unique electromechanical control system which can slow down the rotor, preventing it from reaching dangerous speeds.

The unique nature of the system developed by the Russian scientists consists of its low use of small amounts of power from the generator itself for braking. The completely automatic control system consists of a combination of mechanical and electrical blocks, a programmable microcontroller, and a set of sensors which monitor the current state of the wind turbine's main components.

Yevgeny Sirotkin, a postgraduate student at South Ural State University's Polytechnic Institute, said that the system he and his fellow researchers are working on is one-of-a-kind. ""The system we ae making has no analogues in the world. We plan to create a small enterprise which will engage in the production of these systems.""

""In the Arctic, such a system can pay for itself in the space of a week or a month, following the first wind storm,"" Sirotkin explained. ""The cost of our electromechanical system will be only 2-3% that of the total cost of the wind turbine, and will have a service life of 35 years.""

The scientist emphasized that in areas without a power grid, the cost of electricity generated from wind turbines is just 5-10 rubles per kilowatt-hour ($0.08-0.16 US), far below the cost of energy produced by diesel generators, which can reach up to 80 rubles per kWh ($1.33), and aren't suited for year-round use in harsh Arctic conditions.

The mass production of the super-tough Russian wind turbines requires a large production capacity, including a workshop for casting rotors, a shop for building generators, a workshop for its metal support components, etc. Therefore, the final assembly will take place at a large defense enterprise with which South Ural State University is already cooperating. University scientists will produce the control systems, and supply the finished products for installation aboard the turbines.

The scientists say they are already conducting joint scientific work with their US counterparts, and that Japanese investors are interested in the development of vertical axis wind turbines.

© AFP 2017/ TOSHIFUMI KITAMURA Okinawa Government Files New Lawsuit Over US Air Base Relocation

Construction work to lay the foundations for a new US Marine Corps airbase on the island of Okinawa has hit a snag after local authorities launched another legal bid to stop the work, which has been approved by the Japanese defense ministry but bitterly opposed by local people.

The government of Okinawa prefecture lodged a legal complaint in the Naha district court on July 24, citing environmental concerns. It is the fifth time that the local government has filed a lawsuit to prevent the construction of the base close to the coastal town of Nago, Henoko Bay. The new airbase will relocate US troops who are currently stationed at the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, located in Ginowan City.

Okinawans have campaigned for the closure of the Futenma base for decades because of security risks posed by the troops' presence. The southwestern Japanese island hosts about half of the US military personnel in Japan, of which there are over 50,000 in total, as well as 40,000 dependents and another 5,500 American civilians employed there by the US Department of Defense.

Okinawa was conquered by the United States during a grueling three-month campaign in early 1945. Over a quarter million US servicemen fought to take the archipelago, which had a prewar civilian population of about 300,000, approximately half of whom were killed or committed suicide. The US ruled Okinawa as a military outpost until 1972, when control was returned to Japan; however, 40 years later, 32 US military bases remained on the island.

Criminal acts committed by US troops against the local population, including rape and robbery, have hardened opinions against the presence of the troops. As a result, the US military and the Japanese government have pledged to relocate the base from Ginowan to a less sparsely populated location, but many locals want to see the base construction plans scrapped altogether.

Despite protests, in April the Japanese government began constructing seawalls for the replacement facility in the coastal area of Nago. The government is dumping building materials into the sea and plans to launch full-fledged landfill work inside the seawalls possibly in the first half of next year, Kyodo reported.

Tamada Masaya, general secretary of the National Association of Dockworkers Unions, told Sputnik that not only do local people fear the threat from US servicemen, they are also worried about the threat of war.

As public demonstrators have had little impact on the plans, protestors are trying different tactics to stall the relocation to the port of Nago. The Japanese dockworkers' association regards the construction of the new base as illegal and is calling on dockworkers across Japan to refuse to participate in the delivery of building materials, Masaya explained.

""Port workers carry out transportation of the material, and they must not be allowed to participate in illegal activities. These kinds of activities do great harm to our colleagues in Okinawa,"" the official said.

""In the long term, construction of the military base could drag us into a war. As a rule, when hostilities begin a port becomes the place where weapons and supplies are delivered and such a base could well become the object of a military attack.""

""As a result, port workers who are not servicemen will be the first victims of the attack. The possibility of such a development of events should alarm us today. Port workers must do their utmost to prevent being drawn into a war. We must not forget that such a danger threatens primarily the port workers of Okinawa, and they understand this well,"" Masaya said."

© AP Photo/ Michael Sohn EU Ready to Take 'Retaliatory Countermeasures' Against US Over Russian Sanctions

Earlier this week, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said that US President Donald Trump has yet to decide on whether or not to slap a new round of sanctions against Russia.

""There is still time. Obviously, President Trump has not yet decided whether he will tighten the anti-Russian sanctions,"" media reports quoted Gabriel as saying.

""In any case, the law stipulates [the US] holding preliminary consultations with us Europeans, before this can happen,"" Gabriel said, referring to the possible imposition of the new anti-Russian sanctions.

He pledged to use this opportunity for the discussion while in close contact with [US Secretary of State] Rex Tillerson.""

Gabriel also stressed that the goal of the sanctions is to end the Ukrainian crisis and exert political pressure, something that he said could be implemented if ""we act together and cohesively.""

At the same time, he promised to rebuff the industrial policy of the United States that it pursues under the cover of sanctions.

Speaking to Sputnik, Russian political analyst Alexey Zudin noted that for the first time in many years, the US's anti-Russian actions caused an uproar in Europe.

""Perhaps for the first time in post-Soviet history, the EU expressed dissatisfaction regarding Washington's restrictive measures against Russia after it became clear that the sanctions would be slapped and that they would seriously affect European companies and the EU economy. EU officials made rather stern statements that the US's actions are unacceptable, even saying that the EU isn't ruling out retaliatory measures,"" Zudin said.

He added that ""the current situation envisaged that there will be this situation's next round which will see negotiations between the US and the European Union on these new anti-Russian sanctions.""

Zudin singled out at least two major aspects pertaining to the matter.

""The main thing is whether such negotiations will finally take place and secondly, many wonder whether Europe will accept possible [the sanctions-related] concessions from Trump and whether there will be any such concessions at all. This is where a new intrigue lies,"" he concluded.

Earlier, German Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries lashed out at the US's anti-Russian sanctions program, saying that it violates international law and punishes European firms; Zypries called on the European Union to consider countermeasures against Washington.

""We consider this as being against international law, plain and simple. The Americans can't punish German companies because they have business interests in another country, but unfortunately that is exactly what they are doing. That means that it is right that the European Commission now considers countermeasures,"" she said.

The latest sanctions bill will fine businesses for helping Moscow expand and enhance its energy export pipelines, theoretically leaving European energy firms open to incurring harsh penalties for having ties to Russian companies.

Of particular concern to Zypries is Nord Stream 2, a pipeline project aimed at pumping Russian natural gas to Europe via the Baltic Sea to landfall in Germany. The project is being spearheaded by Gazprom, and supported by a number of European partners, including Germany's Wintershall and Austria's OMV."

EDINBURGH, May 9, 2017, Sputnik Press Office — The event, entitled ""Loaded Words: A Discussion of Contemporary Russian Propaganda,"" described Sputnik as ""propaganda"" without offering the organization the opportunity to respond.

Sputnik staff, including journalists, management, and representatives of the press office made multiple attempts to engage with the group and repeatedly offered to send a speaker to the panel, which is populated by figures known to be hostile to Sputnik. However, each attempt to get involved in the discussion was met with either no response or direct denial. As a result, the international media organization has submitted a letter to the Scottish Parliament Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee as well as to the convener of the group.

An excerpt from the letter read: ""We as an organization believe this accusation to be unfair, without merit or justification, and certainly not befitting of such a prestigious organization as a Cross-Party Group of the Scottish Parliament. The international media and political scene is fractured enough, without groups such as this throwing around baseless accusations.""

Commenting, Sputnik UK Editor Nikolai Gorshkov said: ""The Scottish Parliament was founded on ideas of openness and debate. This is even reflected in the design of the building. Denying any media access to parliamentary business would contravene these principles, and to deny Sputnik's request to participate in this event, which specifically mentions us, is even more scandalous and is highly hypocritical. Such actions make the organizer's, and by extension the Parliament's, commitment to freedom of the press highly suspect.""

The story of the conflict in Syria over the course of 2015 and 2016 is the theme of the exhibition. Images captured by Sputnik photojournalists and VGTRK cameramen tell the story of the Syrian conflict through the eyes of ordinary people whose lives have been devastated by the war.

Other photographs were taken at the Hmeymim air base and show the contributions of Russian Aerospace Forces in the counterterrorism operation.

The participants include award winning Sputnik journalists Valery Melinkov, Ilya Pitalev, Mikhail Alaeddin, and Mikhail Voskresensky, as well as VGTRK cameramen Viktor Prikhodko, and Alexander Pushin.

The photo exhibition in the Austrian capital is part of the tour of Syrian Chronicles in Russia and abroad. The tour started in Moscow at the State Duma in January 2017. Last April, the photos were displayed in Bucharest.

Russia’s Permanent Representative to the OSCE Alexander Lukashevich commented: “The exhibition of Sputnik and VGTRG in Vienna sends a strong humanitarian and political message toward the fastest possible settlement of the Syrian crisis. It demonstrates which tragedies can happen in different countries when no joint anti-terrorism efforts are being made. This is some kind of a strong signal from Vienna to all those who announce readiness to collectively fight a terror threat. And Russia plays a leading role in consolidating all these efforts in the antiterrorism direction.”

Sputnik special photo correspondent Valery Melnikov commented: “This is not the first European city for the exhibition and I hope many more people will see it. Photography can communicate a great deal of emotion. In my work, I try to show the war in Syria and I want every single person in the world to feel the pain and suffering that people go through in this country, a country I was in love with only a few years ago.”

– Lee Stranahan, a conservative Republican and former lead investigative reporter at Breitbart News, and Garland Nixon, a progressive Democrat, former police officer, and National Board member of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), will co-host ‘Fault Lines with Nixon and Stranahan’. The program, which is produced and broadcast from Sputnik’s Washington DC studio, is available online at the Sputnik website and also on FM 103.5 on HD2 radio in the DC area.

The brand new Sputnik show, which airs weekdays, aims to help its audience think more deeply about the issues raised by offering them both the liberal and conservative viewpoints and encouraging them to draw their own conclusions. The show has already received very positive feedback from listeners who have praised the hosts for their willingness to hear the other’s view and for their skills as investigative reporters.

Commenting, Lee Stranahan said: “I love doing radio, which I believe is one of the best platforms for me to present the investigative journalism that I’m known for. Sputnik offered me a great platform – five days a week, available around the world online and on Washington, DC-area radio, as well as a great co-host, Garland Nixon.”

“I chose to come to Radio Sputnik because it allows me to pursue my interests and express my deeply held beliefs without the constraints of the traditional commercial media. I hope to expose our listeners to progressive social and political positions in way that is both entertaining and enlightening,” Garland Nixon added.

Despite holding vastly different political views and advocating sharply contrasting opinions, both Stranahan and Nixon remain civil and collegial with one another, proving that a difference in point of view does not mean that people cannot get on with one another. The hosts, as well as Sputnik more broadly, hope that their working relationship will be an example for people to follow, especially given the lack of courtesy and friendliness in the modern political and media landscape.

‘Fault Lines’ is the latest addition to the growing roster of Sputnik US programming which includes homegrown talent such as ‘The Bradcast’ and ‘Trendstorm’ as well as syndicated shows such as the ‘Thom Hartmann Program.’

Public opinion in France, Germany, and Great Britain shows that among the reasons that led to the popularity of these parties were high levels of immigration and failed economic policies. In France, approaching half of respondents (45%) believed that it was empty promises that have not been fulfilled; and the others believed it was high levels of immigration into the country. In Germany, people thought that high levels of immigration (52% of respondents) influenced opinion more than failed economic policies (17% of respondents). In Great Britain, nearly half (49%) of respondents mentioned high levels of immigration.

Older people, those aged between 55 and 64, were amongst those most likely to say high levels of immigration. Young people tended to explain the increased popularity of right parties by the need for social reforms.

The survey was held by the international polling company, TNS Global, between February 16−22, 2017. The survey interviewed a total 3,055 respondents via an online survey in Germany, Great Britain, and France.

© Sputnik/ Natalia Seliverstova MP: Russia to Retaliate If US Responds to Moscow Move to Cut Diplomatic Presence

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — Six days after the House approved an anti-Russian sanctions package on July 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on Sunday that the diplomatic presence of the United States in Russia would be cut by 755 people to 455, the same number of diplomatic personnel that Russia currently has in the US.

On Monday, Vice President Mike Pence said Trump will soon sign into law the new legislation that enhances US sanctions against Russia. It passed by overwhelming majorities of 419 to 3 in the House of Representatives and by 98 to two in the Senate.

RUSSIA’S LEGITIMATE GRIEVANCES

The diplomatic climate between the two thermonuclear superpowers was likely to deteriorate further, Eurasian Business Coalition Vice President Ralph Winnie warned in an interview.

""I was not surprised Russia would retaliate in this fashion,"" he said.

Moscow had been angered by the repeated accusations from US politicians and media that Russia had allegedly intervened to try and influence the 2016 presidential election, Winnie recalled.

""They have been very vocal about how they feel that they have been singled out unfairly over sanctions by Congress and by the allegation that they intervened in the US election,"" he said.

Trump still had a window of opportunity to avoid a further deterioration in relations with Moscow if he defied congressional pressure and refused to sign the sanctions legislation, Winnie stated.

""A lot depends on what Trump does next,"" he said.

However, if Trump goes ahead and signs the bill, as Pence has said he will, then Russia could be expected to take other retaliatory measures, angering US hawks even more, Winnie warned.

""If Trump signs the bill, it is likely that there will be more consequences,"" he said.

Jon Huntsman, Trump’s choice as next US ambassador to Moscow has held high level diplomatic positions and also has had extensive experience of doing business with Russia, but he will need all of his tact and skill to try and retain and repair good relations between the two governments, Winnie cautioned.

""Huntsman will have his work cut out to smooth out relations between the United States and Russia,"" he said.

RISKS OF COUNTER-MEASURES

Author and political activist David Swanson suggested that the Moscow government had ordered the cuts in US diplomatic personnel out of increasing anger at the escalating barrage of accusation and hostile measures from the US legislature and government, regardless of Russian peace efforts.

""President Putin said he was frustrated and losing patience. He also characterized US sanctions as being — like US war making and war threats — violations of law,"" Swanson said.

Swanson said the US government needed to be held accountable for its activities in countries ranging from Syria and Libya to Ukraine in an international court of law.

""I wish that Russia and the world would, with the help of responsible US residents, pursue the application of law to US aggression through the World Court and the ICC [International Criminal Court],"" he said.

Washington and Moscow risked getting caught up in a negative cycle of diplomatic and economic measures and retaliation, Swanson cautioned.

""Countermeasures are understandable but do indeed risk a cycle of escalation,"" he advised.

However, the ultimate target of US policy could turn out to be not Russia but Iran, Swanson warned.

""I think we all are in danger of losing focus on the likelihood that the primary victim of the latest sanctions and threats may turn out to be Iran, and all of this may be a prelude to the all-out destruction of that country,"" he concluded.

The new US legislation imposed additional sanctions on Iran and North Korea as well as on Russia.

The bill also states that it is the US policy to secure Ukrainian energy dependence, to promote a non-Russian energy sources throughout Western Europe, and forces the National Security Council to include the Secretary of the Treasury."

The region is rich in natural resources but requires more infrastructure building for deeper economic integration and to boost exports. Asian companies are likely to cash in. Tom McGregor takes a closer look.

By Tom McGregor, CCTV.com Panview commentator and editor based in Beijing

There's more to Russia than oil and gas, and with Western governments imposing harsh sanctions on Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin has touted a look to the Far East proposal.

By cutting taxes and opening doors for foreign direct investments (FDI) in the country's Far East, which borders China, Mongolia, the Korean Peninsula and is in close proximity to Japan, Russia will be able to enjoy higher annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates again.

The Far East covers more than 6 million square kilometers of territory, but is sparsely populated with 6.2 million people, many of them based in the western coast port city of Vladivostok. The region holds an abundance of untapped reserves of natural resources, while rich in agriculture and fisheries.

Unleashing the Benefits

""The Far East shares a border with some of the most dynamically developing economies in the world,"" Russian Minister for Development of the Far East Alexander Galushka told the Asia Times. ""It's key for us to harness that economic power for the benefit of developing our eastern territories.""

Moscow has set up special economic zones and renovated the Free Port of Vladivostok to streamline trade flow between Russia and Asian markets.

Asian miners can explore huge deposits of gold and silver, along with 70 types of ore, such as zinc, coal, iron, titanium, platinum and manganese.

Nonetheless, the major moneymaker for the region remains oil and gas that can be found in the Sakhalin fields. Russian plans to boost liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports to Asian countries.

In the Sakhalin-3 oil and gas project, Japan's Mitsui has just invested over $1 billion. to add a third production line to the Sakhalin-2 LNG plant, which is scheduled to go online by 2021.

Russian oil and gas companies have built mega pipeline networks to export fossil fuels to China as well.

Feeding Its Neighbors

""In the Far East today, more than 500 projects are in the implementation stage with plans for another 300 and when we look at these projects we see that the most popular with investors is agriculture, not mining,"" said Leonid Peluhkov, director-general of the Far East for Attracting Investments and Supporting Exports.

Asian countries have enjoyed remarkable economic growth rates with rapid industrialization and urbanization. Such measures have helped hundreds of millions of Chinese and Asians escape poverty, since many have migrated to cities for higher-paying jobs.

Nonetheless, many farming families had departed from their lands, which means China and other Asian countries can no longer feed themselves. Each year, China imports about $250 million worth of foodstuffs.

Ironically, Western-imposed sanctions have forced Russian agriculture to reform, so there's a larger supply of livestock, dairy and crops, not only to feed the country but also to be exported abroad without inflicting increased inflationary pressures.

Russian farmers are producing soybean, corn, wheat, rice and rapeseed, as well dairy and meat for Asian consumers.

Last September, Moscow and Beijing had set up a $10 billion agricultural fund, mainly funded by Chinese capital, to upgrade logistics on imports to China and to ensure stronger food safety standards for Chinese buyers.

Building Transport Corridors

""We've attracted $37 billion of private investment to the region, but this is not a one-off action,"" said Galushka. ""We plan to keep going and by the end of 2017 accumulate a total of $67 billion in private investments.""

Sounds optimistic, but there's still a significant challenge. Much of the Far East stands isolated with few roads and logistics centers after minerals get extracted, timber — ready for shipment and foodstuffs — set for delivery.

China's One Belt One Road can help. Beijing has pledged to invest in the construction of massive infrastructure projects to jump-start cross-border trade and investments with member states.

Russia was one of the first countries to enroll, as they have upgraded customs on the border to make trade between the two countries more efficient.

China was one of the first supporters of the Far East, launching 23 new projects in farming manufacturing, energy, transportation, logistics and hotel construction.

Meanwhile Japanese firms have tapped in to Russian energy projects, including coal and have ushered in high-tech innovations for Russia's manufacturing sector.

Open Spaces, Open Opportunities

Russia's Far East can lead to riches for Asian companies but it won't happen overnight. To tap into its natural resources, including agriculture and fisheries, much groundwork lies ahead.

Asian companies have already played a pivotal role to urbanize the continent and perhaps the Far East needs some urbanization too for the proposal to succeed.

By constructing more logistics hubs, economic corridors, energy zones and trading ports in the sparsely-populated region, such activities would encourage more Asian investors to move in and score bigger profits in the long term.

© Sputnik/ Sergey Guneev Not Again! Russians Allegedly Targeted Macron Campaign Staff on Facebook

PARIS (Sputnik) — A survey carried out by IFOP pollster and published by Le Journal du Dimanche last week showed that the percentage of those who were ""very satisfied"" with Macron’s presidency dropped from 64 percent seen in June to 54 percent. The pollster said that this constituted an almost unprecedented popularity drop, with the exception of Jacques Chirac losing 15 percentage points between May and July 1995.

UNPOPULAR ECONOMIC MEASURES

Alain Policar, a political philosopher at the French university Sciences Po, told Sputnik that Macron’s popularity dropped because the French were beginning to get a clearer picture of the government’s plans and could see that its policies were not ""progressive"" in terms of the economy.

""We now better understand the project of this government, and we understand that if it is liberal in the American way in terms of customs, meaning rather progressive, it is certainly not that as far as the economy is concerned. For example, there is another measure – the considerable budget cuts in the research sphere, health, etc.; there was a lack of transparency in the dispute with the army chief of staff, and the constraint resignation of the latter,"" Policar explained.

Gen. Pierre de Villiers, the French army’s chief of staff, resigned on July 19 over a disagreement on budget cuts previewed for the military. Earlier in July, Macron told Le Journal du Dimanche that if the army's chief of staff and the president of France find themselves in disagreement, it is the army chief of staff that should give in.

The expert said that Macron’s policy was ""from the economic point of view totally liberal in the French, European sense, not the American one, meaning the politics, which is looking to deregulate the market and remove the protection that the workers and the state employees can have.""

Daniel Boy, a senior researcher at a political science research center CEVIPOF, also suggested that Macron’s ""unpopular economic measures"" were behind the sudden decrease of Macron’s popularity among the French.

""All the highly unpopular economic measures plus the start like that quickly erases the popularity. There is also no state of grace for the economic measures, put in place in the first three months, which was very rapid,"" Boy pointed out.

The expert said that the anti-terror law, aiming to codify some elements of the state of emergency and make them part of the general law, was criticized less directly than the economic measures because its consequences were more difficult to understand.

The draft of the anti-terror law was adopted by the Senate last week and will be discussed in the National Assembly in the fall.

The low turnout at June’s legislative elections may also be behind the decrease of Macron’s popularity meaning that the president could count on limited support, Boy suggested.

""First major reason [for popularity drop] is that Emmanuel Macron got the presidency in a comfortable way, but there was a 50% abstention in the legislative election. So we come to understand that what was missing in this election is the working class, the young people whose abstention was enormous. So the election circle on which Macron’s presidency leans is very weak,"" Boy pointed out.

La Republique en Marche, the party founded by Macron, won over 300 seats in a 577-member National Assembly at the elections held in June.

Boy added that the so-called ""grace period,"" a short period of general satisfaction following the transition to a new administration, has been growing shorter in France as the electorate has been becoming increasingly impatient, ""demanding the result.""

Policar said that the current government restricted its communications policy in attempt to control what the media said.

""The communication of this government is completely restricted. They select journalists, they want to have full control over what’s being said and that I think is playing against him. All that makes him progressive is contradicted by the strictly controlled communication. And this is what’s surprising in the eyes of many,"" Policar said.

The expert noted that the French seemed to be dealing with a president who was more authoritarian than he initially appeared.

""We have an authoritarian president who doesn’t not delegate much, who is certainly drunk with success of his unprecedented and unpredictable political performance, with a simple watchword … We have an impression to be dealing with someone more authoritarian than he looked. I think the French people start opening the eyes regarding Macron’s personality,"" Policar said.

Boy also said that Macron seemed authoritarian.

""It’s the president who rules, who does not explain himself much on the television. In France we have a system that is a bit of a monarchy, everything depends on the personality of that who occupies this office,"" Boy said.

Boy said that Macron’s future approval ratings would depend on his communication policy and on the state of the French economy.

""I think Macron’s popularity will continue to drop, it also depends on the moment when he will choose to have a communication policy to catch up on this, which is not easy since he chose a very narrow way of communication. But also it depends on the economic indicators,"" Boy said.

The expert added that new unemployment statistics would be revealed soon and the president may be seen as responsible for them even if technically it would not be so.

According to Boy, economy was a dominant issue in France and Macron’s popularity would continue to decrease if there were no improvements by the end of the year."

The expert said that Macron’s policy was ""from the economic point of view totally liberal in the French, European sense, not the American one, meaning the politics, which is looking to deregulate the market and remove the protection that the workers and the state employees can have.""

Daniel Boy, a senior researcher at a political science research center CEVIPOF, also suggested that Macron’s ""unpopular economic measures"" were behind the sudden decrease of Macron’s popularity among the French.

""All the highly unpopular economic measures plus the start like that quickly erases the popularity. There is also no state of grace for the economic measures, put in place in the first three months, which was very rapid,"" Boy pointed out.

The expert said that the anti-terror law, aiming to codify some elements of the state of emergency and make them part of the general law, was criticized less directly than the economic measures because its consequences were more difficult to understand.

The draft of the anti-terror law was adopted by the Senate last week and will be discussed in the National Assembly in the fall.

The low turnout at June’s legislative elections may also be behind the decrease of Macron’s popularity meaning that the president could count on limited support, Boy suggested.

""First major reason [for popularity drop] is that Emmanuel Macron got the presidency in a comfortable way, but there was a 50% abstention in the legislative election. So we come to understand that what was missing in this election is the working class, the young people whose abstention was enormous. So the election circle on which Macron’s presidency leans is very weak,"" Boy pointed out.

La Republique en Marche, the party founded by Macron, won over 300 seats in a 577-member National Assembly at the elections held in June.

Boy added that the so-called ""grace period,"" a short period of general satisfaction following the transition to a new administration, has been growing shorter in France as the electorate has been becoming increasingly impatient, ""demanding the result.""

Policar said that the current government restricted its communications policy in attempt to control what the media said.

""The communication of this government is completely restricted. They select journalists, they want to have full control over what’s being said and that I think is playing against him. All that makes him progressive is contradicted by the strictly controlled communication. And this is what’s surprising in the eyes of many,"" Policar said.

The expert noted that the French seemed to be dealing with a president who was more authoritarian than he initially appeared.

""We have an authoritarian president who doesn’t not delegate much, who is certainly drunk with success of his unprecedented and unpredictable political performance, with a simple watchword … We have an impression to be dealing with someone more authoritarian than he looked. I think the French people start opening the eyes regarding Macron’s personality,"" Policar said.

Boy also said that Macron seemed authoritarian.

""It’s the president who rules, who does not explain himself much on the television. In France we have a system that is a bit of a monarchy, everything depends on the personality of that who occupies this office,"" Boy said.

Boy said that Macron’s future approval ratings would depend on his communication policy and on the state of the French economy.

""I think Macron’s popularity will continue to drop, it also depends on the moment when he will choose to have a communication policy to catch up on this, which is not easy since he chose a very narrow way of communication. But also it depends on the economic indicators,"" Boy said.

The expert added that new unemployment statistics would be revealed soon and the president may be seen as responsible for them even if technically it would not be so.

According to Boy, economy was a dominant issue in France and Macron’s popularity would continue to decrease if there were no improvements by the end of the year."

© AP Photo/ Ronald Zak Austrian Chancellor Says New US Sanctions Against Russia 'Unacceptable'

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — The sanctions contained within the new bill, which passed the House by a vote of 419 to 4 earlier this week, targets Russia's defense, intelligence, mining, shipping and railway industries, and restrict dealings with Russian banks and energy companies.

European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker warned the EU College of Commissioners that if the Union’s own energy security interests were not taken into account, Brussels was prepared to take measures of its own in matter of days rather than weeks. Junker also served notice the proposed legislation was intended to put the United States first and could not be allowed to significantly harm the EU nations as a side-effect.

The proposed US legislation is also expected to damage the agreement to build the $10.6 billion North Stream 2 gas pipeline. In April 2017, Russia’s state Gazprom Corporation signed an agreement to move ahead with the giant project with French Engie, Royal Dutch Shell, OMV of Austria and the Germany Uniper and Wintershall companies.

EU RESISTANCE

France and Germany have both spoken out against the proposed new sanctions, which would including penalizing European individuals and companies in a so-called ""secondary"" boycott for doing business with Russia and Iran.

""The EU, especially Western Europeans, have made it clear that will not accept a secondary boycott — proscribed by international law,"" University of Pittsburgh Professor of International Affairs Michael Brenner told Sputnik.

The French Foreign Ministry stated that the measure passed by both chambers of Congress would be illegal under international law even if President Donald Trump signed it, or if it was repassed by both chambers with two-thirds majorities over Trump’s veto.

Noted political commentator, philosopher and University of Louvain Professor Jean Bricmont cautioned that the mounting chorus of criticism against the measure from European leaders clearly indicated it would provoke serious clashes with the United States if it was imposed.

""Sometimes… something has to give: the Europeans are upset with the sanctions; there is even a report of the French National Assembly on the extraterritorial nature of US decisions,"" he recalled.

© AFP 2017/ SAUL LOEB Wall Street Analyst: Sanctions on Russia Part of US Plan to Seek Global Energy Domination

European opinion makers and politicians still feared to stand up to the United States even to defend their own interests since the end of the Cold War, Bricmont noted.

""Our problem is ideological: because of its ‘victory’ in the Cold War, the US has an immense prestige among the European intellectuals and politicians that make it difficult to take ‘anti-American’ measures… even if it would be in Europe’s interests,"" he explained.

Therefore even many leaders who recognized the damage that the new US sanctions against Russia would inflict on EU member states did not dare to say so because they feared angering established interests and powers in Washington, Bricmont pointed out.

""Those opposed to the general confrontational stance will remain silent for fear of provoking the Beast in Washington,"" he said.

US politicians who supported the intensified sanctions on Russia were listening to the same confrontational hawks who had led the United States to failed policies and disaster in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Ukraine, Afghanistan and other theaters, Bricmont recalled.

""It is amazing that those guys who have been wrong about pretty much everything, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Ukraine, Russia and that make the US almost universally hated, and still in charge. This may be the real ‘decline of the West,’"" he declared.

The sanctions are not expected to harm major economic interests in the United States because US-Russian bilateral trade already declined precipitously under previous President Barack Obama reaching only $38.1 billion in 2013. However, the European Union still enjoyed a total trade volume worth $213 billion in 2016 although even that was seriously down from $378 billion in 2013."

US ROLE IN SYRIA VIOLATES UN CHARTER

""The United States military intervention into Syria without the permission of the Syrian government clearly violates the United Nations Charter and the Nuremberg Charter, Judgement and Principles,"" University of Illinois Professor of International Law Francis Boyle told Sputnik on Monday.

The intervention also violated US Army Field Manual 27-10 (1956) on The Law of Land Warfare, Boyle pointed out.

Last week, US media reports stated that President Donald Trump had decided to end a four year CIA military training program costing half a billion dollars a year to train the military forces of Syrian opposition groups seeking to topple the Damascus government.

These groups had been claimed to be moderate and secular but in reality they were dominated by violent, extremist Islamist groups, most notably the Nusra Front, the Syrian franchise of al-Qaeda.

By contrast, the Russian military presence in Syria had been invited by the legal government and was in accord with the principles of international law, Boyle observed.

""Russia is in Syria at the request of the Syrian government, which makes it lawful under international law,"" he said.

Russia had the legal right to sue the United States under international law but this would not change anything in practice because based on previous such attempts, the US government would simply ignore any judgement against it, Boyle noted.

""For Russia to sue the United States at the International Court of Justice over this would be a total waste of time,"" he said.

When Nicaragua did the exact same thing against the Reagan administration, the US government violated the World Court’s 1984 Temporary Restraining Order, Boyle recalled.

On that occasion, the Reagan administration violated the World Court’s Final Judgement on the Merits for Nicaragua and against the United States, Boyle stated.

The US government also ""vetoed Nicaragua’s attempt to enforce the World Court’s Judgement at the United Nations Security Council, and refused to pay Nicaragua even one Yankee Cent in damages,"" he continued.

The same principles that led the World Court to find against the United States and in favour of Nicaragua in 1984 would also apply now if Syria or Russia sought to take legal action against the US intervention in Syria, Boyle explained.

""If you read the World Court’s 1986 Judgement in the Nicaragua Case, all you have to do is substitute Syria for Nicaragua and ‘jihadis’ for ‘contras’ to reach the exact same conclusions of gross illegality,"" he remarked.

Both Russia and Syria would prevail against the United States at the International Court of Justice, Boyle concluded.

Critics have attacked Trump for unilaterally choosing to shut down the CIA training program instead of trying to leverage it to force concessions from Russia.

However, supporters of the decision have pointed out that the program had been wasting hundreds of millions of dollars per year and that it had been long criticized for its ineffectiveness and lack of accountability by many senior US military and intelligence officers.

Retired United Kingdom Foreign Office official Jonathan Clarke agreed that the Trump administration was unlikely to be swayed in its policy-making on Syria if any judgement from the World Court or other international legal body found Washington to be in breach of international law on the issue.

Clarke told Sputnik that he was ""not convinced that this is an administration for which legal compliance is paramount.""

General Thomas in his comments on Friday noted that the stated reasoning for the US presence in Syria was to fight the Islamic State terrorist group (banned in Russia) and other terrorist groups, not the government of President Bashar Assad.

If the Russians presented the legal case against the continued US military presence in Syria US leaders might still want to stay but find they had no ability to do it, Thomas suggested.

""Trump provides the establishment with drama after drama: This functions as a massive distraction from actual policy questions,"" he said. ""Syria is likely being carved up with possibly horrific consequences.""

VotePact.org works to provide voters with a path out of the duopoly

Trump’s decision to end financing rebel groups in Syria seeking to overthrow the legitimate government of President Bashar Assad now carried the risk of ""blowback"" as some of those groups could use their US-supplied weapons and training to attack Americans in retaliation, Husseini warned.

""What will CIA funded rebels do now? Possibly what Mujahideen [in Afghanistan] did decades ago: turn on the US,"" he suggested.

The controversy over the White House press and communications staff also served to distract the US public as well as policymakers from the growing tensions in Jerusalem, where Israeli security forces had cracked down on Muslim activities at the sacred al-Aqsa mosque, Husseini warned.

""What's happening now at al-Aqsa?"" he asked.

Also, in their obsession with Trump’s media team reshuffle, both the US media and politicians in Congress were failing to scrutinize the past record of Christopher Wray’s, Trump selection as the next director of the federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Husseini pointed out.

""The FBI nominee, Christopher Wray, is sailing through though he seems on board with all manner of unconstitutional conduct, since all the Democrats in Congress seem really concerned about is alleged Trump wrongdoing with regard to Russia,"" Husseini said.

The failure to adequately scrutinize Wray, and the failure of US policies across the Middle East gave Trump a much greater window of opportunity to win approval for even more dangerous and rash policies after any a possible future provocation, Husseini feared.

Some critics have praised Scaramucci for his first interaction with the media on Friday after his appointment as White House c director of communications.

Spicer was mocked and criticized over his controversial remark comparing Syrian President Bashar Assad and Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler.

Trump's choice of Scaramucci was reportedly backed by his son-in-low and adviser Jared Kushner, daughter Ivanka and Wilbur Ross, the Commerce Secretary.

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — The move was widely reported in the US media on Wednesday with no denials and has been universally accepted as taking place.

Trump reportedly decided to halt the training about a month ago, after a meeting with CIA Director Mike Pompeo and national security adviser H.R. McMaster, which preceded his talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany earlier this month.

SCRAPPING CIA TRAINING PROGRAM OPENS WAY FOR PEACE DEAL IN SYRIA

© AFP 2017/ BARAA AL-HALABI Moscow Comments Reports of CIA Halting Syrian Rebels' Training Program

The CIA program’s goal was to train at least 5,400 allegedly non-Islamist rebels in an armed force to fight Daesh terror group (outlawed in Russia), while also opposing the legitimate Syrian government of President Bashar Assad.

""This decision opens the door noticeably wider for a negotiated resolution of the dire political conflict (and resulting humanitarian catastrophe) inside Syria,"" historian and Middle East analyst Helena Cobban, a leading expert on Syria, said on Thursday.

Continued US support for the rebel groups, some of which were extreme Islamists, had effectively blocked any moves in the past to end the conflict in Syria that has lasted nearly six-and-a-half years and cost more than 600,000 lives, Cobban explained.

""So long as the United States’ covert-action teams were working hand-in-glove with the forces working tirelessly to overthrow the government of Syria, it was hard to envision the United States also sitting down with those political forces inside and outside the country who seek a negotiated resolution,"" she said.

However, Trump’s decision to end the CIA support program breathed new life into the Syrian peace process, Cobban observed.

The problems plaguing massive US military aid and training for the rebels greatly embarrassed previous President Barack Obama. Senior US officers have testified to Congress that an undetermined number of such rebels have disappeared with US military equipment and actually joined Islamist forces, including Daesh.

On September 16, 2015, then CENTCOM commanding General Lloyd Austin told the US Senate Armed Services Committee that half a billion dollars of funding for military training of Syrian rebels approved by Congress had only produced only four or five opposition troops in the field by that point.

The CIA training and support program for the rebels failed to accomplish any constructive goals, but only spread and intensified the sufferings of ordinary people in Syria, Cobban recalled.

""The CIA's aid to the Syrian ‘rebels’ prolonged and deepened the suffering of Syria's people throughout the whole of the past six years,"" she said.

The real purpose of the program was not to defeat Daesh, but to topple the legitimate Syrian government of President Bashar Assad, Cobban stated.

The Obama administration added to the CIA program a ""very bright green light… to other non-Syrian actors working to overthrow Syria's legitimate government, like the Saudi and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Turkey… and jihadis from all around the world,"" she said.

However, a series of policy shifts by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the clash in the GCC between Qatar and other member states backed by Saudi Arabia looked likely to distract these previous support sources for the Syrian rebels, Cobban observed.

""With the Turkish government now acting a lot more pragmatically than before, and with the ongoing chaos among the GCC countries, it can be hoped that… groups who supported regime change in Syria will now… die of their own accord,"" she said.

The end of CIA training for Syrian rebels was also likely to give a boost to cooperation between governments and other forces in the region that genuinely opposed the Islamic State and other Islamist terror groups, Cobban noted.

Rebels seeking regime change in Damascus were now more likely to ""be quashed through the cooperation of all the sincerely anti-jihadi forces in the region. There is still a lot of diplomatic work to do, but this decision from Washington makes it seem at least more possible,"" she concluded.

CIA PROGRAM SHOWED 5-YEAR RECORD OF CONSISTANT FAILURES

Trump’s decision to terminate the CIA program has been interpreted by analysts as an acknowledgment that the five-year-old program has totally failed to achieve any of its goals, caused damage to US credibility and was not capable of being reformed.

Author and political activist David Swanson said Trump’s decision to end the CIA training program was a long-belated acknowledgment of its complete failure to produce any significant moderate rebel fighting force, while many recruits actually joined the Islamic State or other Islamist groups.

Swanson said the decision to scrap the rebel military training program expressed ""a recognition of reality.""

Previous president Barack Obama had been praised as an alleged moderate and technocrat, yet he had ignored his own best intelligence assessments to launch a costly the costly CIA training program after being given due warning that it would not work, Swanson recalled.

""When Obama was president he had the CIA produce a study on whether aiding proxy forces had ever succeeded on its own terms. The answer was no, yet Obama, the supposedly intelligent technocrat went ahead and did exactly what the study had found would not work,"" he said.

Trump’s decision to end the CIA training program was rational and sensible, but came as a surprise because US policies in the Middle East and especially on Syria had not been guided by such considerations, Swanson observed.

""Ending it after years of predictable and predicted failure is only hard to explain because we have come to expect completely illogical madness,"" he said.

Trump may also have scrapped the program as part of some quid pro quo arrangement he had negotiated with Putin at their G20 meeting, Swanson noted.

The decision to end the CIA training could indicate ""some deal struck between Trump and Putin, but since neither of them is likely to tell us, we are left to speculate,"" he said.

Although Trump had ordered the end of the training program, it remained to be seen whether he could ensure that the US armed forces and the CIA obeyed his orders and actually enforced the decision, Swanson cautioned.

""The decision is a good one on its own terms if it's real. But what goes with it remains to be seen — including whether the US military and CIA actually comply with it,"" he warned.

Swanson assessed that the results of the CIA training program had been entirely disastrous.

It had only produced ""massive death and suffering, militarization of a region, fueling of hatred and hostility and terrorism for years to come,"" he concluded.

The CIA reportedly maintained its program to provide weapons to Syrian opposition fighters since 2012. However, the private intelligence firm Soufran Group noted in a report on Thursday that the training program was ineffective and problematic since its launch."

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — The move was widely reported in the US media on Wednesday with no denials and has been universally accepted as taking place.

Trump reportedly decided to halt the training about a month ago, after a meeting with CIA Director Mike Pompeo and national security adviser H.R. McMaster, which preceded his talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany earlier this month.

SCRAPPING CIA TRAINING PROGRAM OPENS WAY FOR PEACE DEAL IN SYRIA

© AFP 2017/ BARAA AL-HALABI Moscow Comments Reports of CIA Halting Syrian Rebels' Training Program

The CIA program’s goal was to train at least 5,400 allegedly non-Islamist rebels in an armed force to fight Daesh terror group (outlawed in Russia), while also opposing the legitimate Syrian government of President Bashar Assad.

""This decision opens the door noticeably wider for a negotiated resolution of the dire political conflict (and resulting humanitarian catastrophe) inside Syria,"" historian and Middle East analyst Helena Cobban, a leading expert on Syria, said on Thursday.

Continued US support for the rebel groups, some of which were extreme Islamists, had effectively blocked any moves in the past to end the conflict in Syria that has lasted nearly six-and-a-half years and cost more than 600,000 lives, Cobban explained.

""So long as the United States’ covert-action teams were working hand-in-glove with the forces working tirelessly to overthrow the government of Syria, it was hard to envision the United States also sitting down with those political forces inside and outside the country who seek a negotiated resolution,"" she said.

However, Trump’s decision to end the CIA support program breathed new life into the Syrian peace process, Cobban observed.

The problems plaguing massive US military aid and training for the rebels greatly embarrassed previous President Barack Obama. Senior US officers have testified to Congress that an undetermined number of such rebels have disappeared with US military equipment and actually joined Islamist forces, including Daesh.

On September 16, 2015, then CENTCOM commanding General Lloyd Austin told the US Senate Armed Services Committee that half a billion dollars of funding for military training of Syrian rebels approved by Congress had only produced only four or five opposition troops in the field by that point.

The CIA training and support program for the rebels failed to accomplish any constructive goals, but only spread and intensified the sufferings of ordinary people in Syria, Cobban recalled.

""The CIA's aid to the Syrian ‘rebels’ prolonged and deepened the suffering of Syria's people throughout the whole of the past six years,"" she said.

The real purpose of the program was not to defeat Daesh, but to topple the legitimate Syrian government of President Bashar Assad, Cobban stated.

The Obama administration added to the CIA program a ""very bright green light… to other non-Syrian actors working to overthrow Syria's legitimate government, like the Saudi and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Turkey… and jihadis from all around the world,"" she said.

However, a series of policy shifts by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the clash in the GCC between Qatar and other member states backed by Saudi Arabia looked likely to distract these previous support sources for the Syrian rebels, Cobban observed.

""With the Turkish government now acting a lot more pragmatically than before, and with the ongoing chaos among the GCC countries, it can be hoped that… groups who supported regime change in Syria will now… die of their own accord,"" she said.

The end of CIA training for Syrian rebels was also likely to give a boost to cooperation between governments and other forces in the region that genuinely opposed the Islamic State and other Islamist terror groups, Cobban noted.

Rebels seeking regime change in Damascus were now more likely to ""be quashed through the cooperation of all the sincerely anti-jihadi forces in the region. There is still a lot of diplomatic work to do, but this decision from Washington makes it seem at least more possible,"" she concluded.

CIA PROGRAM SHOWED 5-YEAR RECORD OF CONSISTANT FAILURES

Trump’s decision to terminate the CIA program has been interpreted by analysts as an acknowledgment that the five-year-old program has totally failed to achieve any of its goals, caused damage to US credibility and was not capable of being reformed.

Author and political activist David Swanson said Trump’s decision to end the CIA training program was a long-belated acknowledgment of its complete failure to produce any significant moderate rebel fighting force, while many recruits actually joined the Islamic State or other Islamist groups.

Swanson said the decision to scrap the rebel military training program expressed ""a recognition of reality.""

Previous president Barack Obama had been praised as an alleged moderate and technocrat, yet he had ignored his own best intelligence assessments to launch a costly the costly CIA training program after being given due warning that it would not work, Swanson recalled.

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — The contacts between Washington and Havana on the matters like migration and drug trafficking will likely be postponed under the administration of US President Donald Trump, while the cultural and scientific exchanges may continue, Director of Cuban Research Institute at Florida International Institute Jorge Duany told Sputnik.

""It appears that high-level contacts between the US and Cuban governments have already stalled, compared to the last two years of the Obama administration,"" Duany said. ""Some of the initial exchanges regarding drug trafficking, human smuggling, environmental issues, and migration may be put on hold by the Trump administration. The educational, scientific, and cultural exchanges facilitated by Obama might still continue under the Trump era.""

Duany noted that although the US and Cuban governments have expressed a desire to continue a dialogue on issues of mutual interest, the atmosphere for these conversations seems ""more charged than during the last term of the Obama presidency.""

""At least rhetorically, the two governments seem to have returned to their entrenched Cold War positions before December 17, 2014,"" he stated.

Thursday marks the second anniversary of the official restoration of diplomatic relations between Washington and Havana after more than 50 years of severed ties. The warming of relations came as a result of then President Barack Obama’s decision in December 2014 to pursue a path toward normalizing relations with Cuba.

In June, however, US President Donald Trump announced his administration would roll back Obama's efforts to re-establish ties with Cuba. Trump said there would be new business and travel restrictions imposed on Havana, and Washington will retain the existing embargo.

Duany believes that it's difficult to foresee any major advances in US- Cuba relations, as long as the Cuban government continues to make claims such as the return of Guantanamo Bay naval base or the repeal of the Cuban Adjustment Act, and the US government insists that Cuba should hold free elections and legalize all political parties.

""The Trump administration is currently involved in spelling out how the presidential directive signed on June 16 will be implemented by various US government agencies, such as the departments of the Treasury and Commerce,"" Duany noted. ""It is crucial that the new regulations clarify just how the prohibitions against dealing with entities controlled by the Cuban armed forces or individual people-to-people travel will be put into practice.""

The director noted that while at this point, it remains unclear whether Trump’s partial reversal of Obama’s policies toward Cuba will affect the fledgling private sector of the Cuban economy.

""Should the number of US travelers to Cuba be reduced, many small businesses related to the tourist industry on the Island could be hurt by a decreased demand for their services,"" he added.

When commenting on the results archived during the two years of the normalization process, Duany emphasized that the pace of normalization was swift in some areas, such as the removal of Cuba from the US State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism, the reestablishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, or the opening of embassies in Washington and Havana.

""The most significant change since December 17, 2014, when Barack Obama and Raúl Castro announced the beginning of the thaw in U.S.-Cuba relations, has been the spectacular increase in the number of U.S. travelers to Cuba,"" he added.

""In other areas, such as U.S. trade and investment in Cuba, the situation has remained intractabale, especially given the persistence of the U.S. embargo of the Island,"" Duany concluded.

Last week, Cuban President Raul Castro criticized the new US policy, which excludes the possibility of continuing a bilateral dialogue or the implementation of the previously signed agreements between the two countries, but noted that Cuba nevertheless wishes to engage in dialogue with the United States.

Cuban officials warned in June that a reversal of Washington’s policy toward Havana would fail. Moreover, Cuba has hit back by accusing the United States of a huge number of murders and misconduct by its police as well as of illegal detention and torture of prisoners in the US detention center at Guantanamo Bay.

On July 20, 2015 the United States and Cuba reestablished full diplomatic relations by reopening embassies in their respective capitals after 54 years of hostility."

On Monday, China held a massive military parade at the Zhurihe military base in Inner Mongolia dedicated to the 90th anniversary of the PLA's founding, with some 12,000 servicemen, 129 aircraft and 571 military vehicles taking part in the event.

During the parade, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that his country needed the strong army more than ever before, according to media reports.

Despite the fact that Xi in 2015 announced his intention to reduce the number of China's military personnel by 300,000, the over 2-million-strong PLA still remains the world's largest military force.

Parade Show of Force

During Monday's parade, the Chinese leadership displayed the most advanced military hardware at its disposal, including Type 99A main battle tanks, HJ-10 anti-tank missile systems, Shenyang J-16 strike fighters and Chengdu J-20 fifth-generation stealth fighter aircraft.

Beijing also presented its ""carrier killer"" – the DF-21D anti-ship medium range ballistic missile – and unveiled the new DF-31AG intercontinental ballistic missile, which has a maximum range of over 10,000 kilometers.

The state-run news agency Xinhua reported that ""it was the first time China has marked Army Day, which formally falls on August 1, with a military parade since the Communist revolution in 1949.""

Speaking at the parade, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that the PLA ""is able to defeat any aggressor, and is determined to defend national sovereignty, security and the interests of the country.""

At the same time, the Chinese leader stressed that the PLA's main responsibility is to ensure that ordinary people can live in peace.

Macau-based military expert Anthony Wong Dong told the South China Morning Post that ""in the face of ongoing crises in the South China Sea and on the Korean Peninsula…the parade certainly became the show of China's military power.""

History of the PLA

The PLA was founded on August 1, 1927, during the Nanchang uprising against the then-ruling Kuomintang party. The later civil war resulted in founding the People's Republic of China in mainland China on October 1, 1949.

The latest turning point in the PLA's history happened in 2015, when Chinese authorities announced their intention to significantly reform their armed forces in order to increase the army's combat capability.

In this connection, on February 1, 2016, the PLA's structure was changed and its seven military districts were transformed into North, South, West, East and Central military command zones. All of these zones are under the command of the Central Military Commission, which is chaired by the Chinese President.

Another major restructuring of the PLA took place on January 11, 2016 which saw the establishment of the PLA Joint headquarters, due to be subordinate to the Central Military Council.

The start of military reforms was followed by the creation of missile and strategic forces within the PLA. At present, these forces, along with the land, air and naval forces as well as the People's Armed Police constitute the Chinese armed forces.

China's military spending is constantly on the increase and the country's defense budget is the world's second-largest after that of the US, according to media reports.

That could bump China's total military spending could approach $500 billion, according to some estimates. https://t.co/G7uOCOxcvW — NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) 29 июня 2017 г.

China's military budget in 2017 amounts to 1.3 percent of the country's GDP or 151.97 billion dollars. For comparison's sake, Washington has insisted that its NATO allies increase military spending to 2.0 percent of GDP, and the US itself spends over 600 billion dollars annually on defense.

En Route to Remote Shores

Right now, China is expanding its global military clout, which was something that became evident after a group of ships of the PLA's Navy left for Djibouti in July 2017 to build a logistics base near the Horn of Africa. The facility will be Beijing's first foreign military base.

Another look at China's new military base in Djiboutihttps://t.co/7l2mnGTJGJ — rhk111 Defense (@PhilDefNews) 31 июля 2017 г.

The Chinese Defense Ministry has repeatedly noted that the base will be used for peacekeeping operations, fighting piracy and delivering humanitarian aid. As the world's largest exporter of manufactured goods, China hopes to ensure the safety and reliability of nearby shipping lanes.

However, experts believe that base will help China protect its interests in the region and exert pressure on the countries that are of economic interest to Beijing.

Since 1990, China has also actively participated in UN peacekeeping missions. In 2012, about 2,000 Chinese military servicemen were involved in such missions, mainly in Africa."

A US Defense Department report noted in 2015 that missile and attack submarines from Beijing had been operating in those waters, and China claims that it’s only in the Indian emergency missions, anti-piracy patrols, humanitarian aid and other non-military operations.

With 50,000 ships passing through each year, the the 550-mile-long Malacca Strait has become a popular area for pirates.

In May, one source involved with Indian defense said, ""The pretext is anti-piracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden … But what role can submarines play against pirates and their [ships]?"""

The USS Rafael Peralta was commissioned into service at the 32nd Street Naval Station in San Diego, California. The ship’s namesake refers to former US Marine Rafael Peralta who sacrificed his life during the second battle of Fallujah by jumping on a grenade that killed him instantly but saved the lives of fellow service members, the US Navy said in an announcement Monday.

Peralta immigrated to the US from Mexico in 1997. He joined the Marine Corps immediately upon being granted a green card, the US Navy said.

""This is more than just another commissioning,"" Gen. Robert Neller said during the principal address. ""It marks the commemoration of a law and the immortality of a hero,"" the Marine Corps commandant said.

The US Navy destroyer is equipped with helicopter landing pads, Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles, the AEGIS weapon system, Tomahawk land-attack missiles, an anti-submarine weapons system and advanced anti-air missiles.

The US Navy plans to increase the size of its fleet from 276 to 355 vessels while the Chinese navy is reportedly pursuing an ambition to grow its naval force to 500 ships."

MOSCOW (Sputnik) – Masaya Tamada urged the trade unions across Japan to prevent the companies from supplying soil for the construction of the seawall off the coast of Nago as part of the project and prevent the dock workers from transporting this soil.

""The dock workers must do their best not to allow being engaged in war. One should not forget that such danger threats primarily the Okinawa dock workers,"" Tamada said.

Tamada also called the transportation of soil to Nago an ""abusive practice.""

When the military actions begin, a port usually becomes a supply base from which arms and products are supplied to the frontline. Such a base can become a target for an attack.

The seawall construction has been underway in Okinawa for three months. On July 24, the local authorities filed the fifth lawsuit against the Tokyo authorities aimed at halting the landfill project citing damage to fishing grounds caused by the crushing of rocks and offshore reefs. As part of the legal battle over the seawall construction, the Okinawa authorities believe the government should have requested their permission for the actions. The Japanese government, in turn, insists it must not ask for the approval from the local authorities for the project."

The Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG), which helps catch landing aircraft on the carrier’s deck, and the Electromagnetic Launch System (EMALS) ""have been successfully tested ashore at Lakehurst, New Jersey, but this is the first shipboard recovery and launch of a fleet of fixed-wing aircraft,"" said Capt. Rick McCormack, the Ford’s Commanding Officer.

The aircraft to complete the flight was a Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet.

EMALS has drawn Trump’s scorn. “I said what system are you going to be [using] – ‘Sir, we’re staying with digital,’” Trump recalled. “I said, no you’re not. [You’re] going to goddamned steam.” Trump then alleged that not only does the new system cost far more than existing technologies, but slammed it as “no good.”

“It sounded bad to me. Digital. They have digital. What is digital?” Trump wondered. He continued to insist only Albert Einstein could figure out “digital” launches.

The US Navy transitioned from the steam launch system to EMALS to cut down on maintenance and repair costs. EMALS also saves quite a bit of space that extensive steam pipe networks take up inside the guts of aircraft carriers.

While this represents a big step forward for EMALS and AAG aboard Ford-class carriers, the ship has a ways to go before she will be combat ready. Though Trump formally commissioned the Ford on July 22, the Government Accountability Office estimates that it will take four years to integrate the carrier’s new systems —including new radars and weapons elevators — with the rest of the US Navy."

Fighting between the Ukrainian army and pro-independence militia in the Donbass intensified last month; several dozen combatants were killed and dozens more were wounded in July.

© AFP 2017/ CLEMENS BILAN Main Pacifist of Europe? Why France Reduces Its Military Budget

France and Germany have drawn up a blueprint for ""permanent structural cooperation"" among the EU countries in defense matters, following last month's European Council meeting which discussed options for ""strategic autonomy"" in EU defense.

The joint report from the EU's most powerful members describes a ""long-term vision"" that participating states develop the ability of their armed forces to fully execute military tasks, the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, which has seen a copy of the document, reported on Sunday.

The new military capabilities will be developed ""in addition to NATO, which will continue to be the cornerstone of the collective defense of its members,"" the report added.

The proposal was formulated after last month's bilateral defense council meeting, at which Berlin and Paris agreed upon conditions under which countries should participate in the defense pact. These include a commitment to increase defense spending to ""approach"" the two percent demanded by NATO and to invest 20 percent of military spending on research, development, and equipment acquisition.

France and Germany also propose that member states' armed forces undergo an annual assessment by the European Defense Agency, whose powers will be significantly strengthened.

Jean-Vincent Brisset, a retired French army brigadier general and senior analyst at the Institut de Relations Internationales et Strategiques (IRIS) said that the European defense initiative is in its earliest of stages and needs political will to succeed.

""A lot of staff headquarters are discussing and thinking about these issues, but in practice not much is being done,"" he told Sputnik France.

""There are countries that unreservedly support NATO, who would prefer to maintain loyalty to it – I would not say that they are under its control, but they have a certain will to remain close to the United States instead of participating in [defense] cooperation of a purely European character.""

""At the moment, much is being said about the new position of French diplomacy. There a lot of words but not a lot of action … however, it could be that maybe now we can really make something happen in practice,"" Brisset said, more optimistically.

Dr. Caroline Galacteros, a political analyst and colonel in the French Army's operational reserve, told Sputnik France that the proposal is a timely move toward more defense autonomy from the US.

""This is a good initiative since it is being proposed at a time when the situation at both the European and international level is conducive to such initiatives. American foreign policy, US policy towards Europe is not easy to understand…The time has come for Europe should show that it has its own legitimacy with regard to strategic autonomy,"" Galacteros said.

""I am not privy to the details of the negotiations, but I think that there will probably be a consolidation of the costs of conducting external operations which today fall mainly on the shoulders of France despite the fact that such operations concerns the defense of all Europeans. Our operations in the Sahel are carried out with too little support from our European partners.""

France, Germany, Italy and others have expressed renewed interest in a pan-European defense initiative in recent years, especially in light of the UK's decision to leave the EU.

© AFP 2017/ CLEMENS BILAN Main Pacifist of Europe? Why France Reduces Its Military Budget

France and Germany have drawn up a blueprint for ""permanent structural cooperation"" among the EU countries in defense matters, following last month's European Council meeting which discussed options for ""strategic autonomy"" in EU defense.

The joint report from the EU's most powerful members describes a ""long-term vision"" that participating states develop the ability of their armed forces to fully execute military tasks, the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, which has seen a copy of the document, reported on Sunday.

The new military capabilities will be developed ""in addition to NATO, which will continue to be the cornerstone of the collective defense of its members,"" the report added.

The proposal was formulated after last month's bilateral defense council meeting, at which Berlin and Paris agreed upon conditions under which countries should participate in the defense pact. These include a commitment to increase defense spending to ""approach"" the two percent demanded by NATO and to invest 20 percent of military spending on research, development, and equipment acquisition.

France and Germany also propose that member states' armed forces undergo an annual assessment by the European Defense Agency, whose powers will be significantly strengthened.

Jean-Vincent Brisset, a retired French army brigadier general and senior analyst at the Institut de Relations Internationales et Strategiques (IRIS) said that the European defense initiative is in its earliest of stages and needs political will to succeed.

""A lot of staff headquarters are discussing and thinking about these issues, but in practice not much is being done,"" he told Sputnik France.

""There are countries that unreservedly support NATO, who would prefer to maintain loyalty to it – I would not say that they are under its control, but they have a certain will to remain close to the United States instead of participating in [defense] cooperation of a purely European character.""

""At the moment, much is being said about the new position of French diplomacy. There a lot of words but not a lot of action … however, it could be that maybe now we can really make something happen in practice,"" Brisset said, more optimistically.

Dr. Caroline Galacteros, a political analyst and colonel in the French Army's operational reserve, told Sputnik France that the proposal is a timely move toward more defense autonomy from the US.

""This is a good initiative since it is being proposed at a time when the situation at both the European and international level is conducive to such initiatives. American foreign policy, US policy towards Europe is not easy to understand…The time has come for Europe should show that it has its own legitimacy with regard to strategic autonomy,"" Galacteros said.

""I am not privy to the details of the negotiations, but I think that there will probably be a consolidation of the costs of conducting external operations which today fall mainly on the shoulders of France despite the fact that such operations concerns the defense of all Europeans. Our operations in the Sahel are carried out with too little support from our European partners.""

France, Germany, Italy and others have expressed renewed interest in a pan-European defense initiative in recent years, especially in light of the UK's decision to leave the EU. The UK had been a staunch supporter of NATO and has continued to oppose a European defense union even after its decision to longer be a part of the EU.

On Sunday, the US vice president started a four-day visit to Estonia, Georgia and Montenegro.

The Trump administration is preparing sanctions against China in an effort to pressure Beijing into exerting more control over North Korea, the US media reported on Monday.

Trump's aides have spent several days discussing possible economic measures, such as trade restrictions, and are expected to announce a final decision which is expected as soon as this week, White House officials told Politico.

The discussions in Washington come as Pyongyang continues to test intercontinental ballistic missiles. On Friday, North Korea launched a missile which flew 732 kilometers (454 miles), reached an altitude of 681 kilometers (423 miles) and fell in the central part of the Sea of Japan, according to the Russian Defense Ministry.

Trump said on Twitter that he is ""very disappointed in China"" for failing to stop the testing. Beijing has called on Pyongyang to adhere to UN resolutions that forbid the missile launches, but maintains that having already imposed sanctions on Pyongyang in line with the resolutions, there is little more it can do.

I am very disappointed in China. Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2017

…they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk. We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2017

​​Following the Obama administration's deployment of THAAD anti-ballistic defense systems in South Korea, the Trump administration has continued to strengthen its military presence in the Korean peninsula. In April, Trump sent an ""armada"" to the region and has said that all ""options are on the table,"" including military action against Pyongyang.

Having inflamed the situation on the Korean peninsula, the Trump administration is trying to put pressure on China in order to save face and avoid a military intervention, Dr. Francesco Sisci, senior researcher at People's University of China, told Radio Sputnik.

""In a way, the threat of sanctions is still a way of trying to find a political solution. Otherwise, the stalemate could fester and then, of course, there could be military action,"" Sisci said.

Given that the trade turnover of goods and services between the US and China totaled $648.2 billion in 2016, economic sanctions would be very difficult to enforce. The situation is exacerbated by growing mistrust between Washington and Beijing, the analyst warned.

""I believe this growing mistrust is the root of the problem. The US thinks that China can do more about North Korea, China argues that it is already doing enough and in my view the problem is, how can the two sides build more trust and what can we do as third parties to help to build this trust and find a creative solution to this North Korea problem.""

Applying more sanctions to North Korea is also problematic because of the effect they could have on North Koreans.

""China can put sanctions on North Korea but then North Korea can trade with Mongolia or Russia or other countries and circumvent the sanctions. So, how can you have sanctions or other effective measures that can actually put pressure on North Korea without letting North Korea burst, because this is the other problem – you want to contain North Korea.""

""It is still very difficult, but in a positive way I would say that the US despite the rhetoric is still looking for a political solution, it's not ready to go and use military means,"" Sisci said.

""The problem of North Korea is that it is extremely difficult to manage and my sense is that within the US and China there are also different opinions about how to handle North Korea. This difference of opinion makes the handling of the North Korea problem even more difficult and of course, Pyongyang has an easy way of playing one against the other – the US against China, China against Russia, Russia against China and the US.""

""In my view, unless all the concerned countries find a common ground and common policy, North Korea will be in a good position to play one against the other."""

A number of people were reported killed during protests that broke out during the vote. A group of foreign countries, including the United States, have opposed the vote and refused to recognize its results.

Maduro is not the first leader, who has been sanctioned by foreign powers for certain activities.

On January 17, Washington sanctioned President Milorad Dodik of Republika Srpska, which is one of two entities comprising Bosnia and Herzegovina, for blocking the Dayton Peace Accords reached in 1995.

On July 16, 2016, the United States imposed sanctions on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un along with 22 other country's officials and organizations citing their alleged responsibility for violation of human rights.

On May 13, 2014, then-US President Barack Obama put a group of five politicians from the Central African Republic on the sanctions list due to their involvement in violence and human rights abuses. The restrictions targeted former country's president Francois Bozize, who was toppled in 2013. Nourredine Adam, who was the country's ex-minister of public security, and Levy Yakete, the leader of Christian rebels fighting against Islamists in the African state, were also sanctioned.

On May 18, 2011, the United States imposed sanctions against Syrian President Bashar Assad due to violations of human rights in the Middle Eastern nation. In April, Washington also imposed unilateral sanctions on several Syrian officials and state institutions, however they had not targeted Assad.

On April 7, 2011, the European Union imposed additional sanctions against the leadership of Cote d'Ivoire due to the deterioration of the situation in the African nation. Brussels decided to prohibit the purchase of bonds and securities to the illegitimate government of former President Laurent Gbagbo, who refused to transfer power to his presidential rival Alassane Ouattara.

On March 24, 2006, the EU leaders approved the sanctions against Belarusian authorities, including the country's President Alexander Lukashenko. The EU foreign ministers have also worked out a ""black list"" of Belarusian officials complicating issuing of Schengen visas for them.

In 2001, the United States introduced anti-Zimbabwean sanctions. The European Union has also targeted the African nation with both personal and economic sanctions in the 2000s, prolonging them for several times. However, the Council of the European Union started lifting the restrictions and by 2014, only the country's President Robert Mugabe, his wife and the Zimbabwe Defense Industries arms supplier were on the sanctions list."

On May 13, 2014, then-US President Barack Obama put a group of five politicians from the Central African Republic on the sanctions list due to their involvement in violence and human rights abuses. The restrictions targeted former country's president Francois Bozize, who was toppled in 2013. Nourredine Adam, who was the country's ex-minister of public security, and Levy Yakete, the leader of Christian rebels fighting against Islamists in the African state, were also sanctioned.

On May 18, 2011, the United States imposed sanctions against Syrian President Bashar Assad due to violations of human rights in the Middle Eastern nation. In April, Washington also imposed unilateral sanctions on several Syrian officials and state institutions, however they had not targeted Assad.

On April 7, 2011, the European Union imposed additional sanctions against the leadership of Cote d'Ivoire due to the deterioration of the situation in the African nation. Brussels decided to prohibit the purchase of bonds and securities to the illegitimate government of former President Laurent Gbagbo, who refused to transfer power to his presidential rival Alassane Ouattara.

On March 24, 2006, the EU leaders approved the sanctions against Belarusian authorities, including the country's President Alexander Lukashenko. The EU foreign ministers have also worked out a ""black list"" of Belarusian officials complicating issuing of Schengen visas for them.

In 2001, the United States introduced anti-Zimbabwean sanctions. The European Union has also targeted the African nation with both personal and economic sanctions in the 2000s, prolonging them for several times. However, the Council of the European Union started lifting the restrictions and by 2014, only the country's President Robert Mugabe, his wife and the Zimbabwe Defense Industries arms supplier were on the sanctions list."

Moreover, in the summer the situation in the region has become further aggravated. To add fuel to the fire, recently Hanoi has struck back following calls from Beijing to stop oil exploration in Block 136-03 of the South China Sea. Sputnik spoke to an analyst about this issue.

""Vietnam’s petroleum-related activities take place in the sea entirely under the sovereignty and jurisdiction of Vietnam established in accordance with international law,"" Vietnam’s Foreign Ministry said Friday.

However, Beijing reportedly threatened to attack Vietnamese positions in the Spratly/Nansha Islands of the sea if an oil discovery operation led by Spanish oil firm Respol was not called off on July 15.

This incident clearly shows that the tensions that arose after the abolition of joint Chinese-Vietnamese exercises this June are still quite strong.

Furthermore, US President Donald Trump has reportedly approved a plan to give the US Navy more freedom to carry out patrols in the South China Sea.

In order to make sense of what exactly is going on in the South China Sea, Sputnik spoke with an expert at the Center for Strategic Research, Anton Tsvetov.

“Recently, the US media reported that Donald Trump approved a plan of Defense Minister James Mattis to conduct operations on freedom of navigation. If the information is correct, these operations will be held on a regular basis, rather than being approved each time by the National Security Council,” Tsvetov said.

This move is a clear sign that the US is planning on stepping up operations in the South China Sea and, according to the expert, there is another player on the horizon that is slowly nearing the dispute: the United Kingdom.

“UK Foreign Minister Boris Johnson plans on sending two aircraft carriers that were just launched to ‘strengthen the rule-based world order,’” Tsvetov said.

The UK’s modern HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier is the largest ship built for the UK Royal Navy and it is currently undergoing tests.

The vessel should be approved by the navy by the end of 2017. The second ship, the HMS Prince of Wales, is currently being fitted in a Scottish shipyard.

Meanwhile, China continues to strengthen relations with Roderigo Duterte. During a visit to Manila, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that the joint mining of minerals in the South China Sea, which, according to the Philippine president, may begin as early as this year, will become a model for the settlement of territorial disputes.

“Nevertheless, experts who follow the activity of China on the controlled structures in the South China Sea believe that the Chinese military facilities on the ‘big three’ [Subi, Mischief and Faerie Cross Reefs] are already giving it unprecedented control over the heart of the disputed water area,” Tsvetov said.

Perhaps the most harmless way to struggle for influence in the South China Sea was chosen by Indonesia, announcing a new name for the section of the sea crossing with the Indonesian exclusive economic zone.

The North-Natun Sea now complements the list, which already has the West Philippine and Vietnamese East Seas in them.

“In other words, nothing good is happening in the South China Sea,” Tsvetov said.

He further said, “So far, neither side has demonstrated the ability to perceive the interests of its counterparties and move away from radical positions on the question of sovereignty.”

Tsvetov also noted that currently this sea is not jam-packed, but considering the current pace of naval modernization of various parties involved soon it will not be so easy to coexist for everyone in the South China Sea.

“This increases the risk of an accidental conflict,” the expert concluded."

Space unites astronauts from different countries and nationalities. In a candid interview an Italian astronaut, Roberto Vittori, who has twice flown with Russian cosmonauts shared his experience of working with them.

On Friday, Vittori took part in the broadcast of the launch of the Russian Soyuz MS-05 manned spacecraft.

It took off from the Baikonur spaceport in Kazakhstan to deliver a new expedition to the International Space Station (ISS).

Members of the new expedition include Russian cosmonaut Sergei Ryazanski, US astronaut Randolph Bresnik and Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli.

Right after the launch of the spacecraft, the audience gathered in the hall of the Italian Space Agency, including Roberto Vittori who noticed a toy gnome fixed on the dashboard in front of the crew.

Vittori wasn’t surprised though because he had flown with Russian cosmonauts before, once in 2002 and later in 2005.

Russians are very connected with their own history, and they carry it with them even when flying into space, Italian astronaut Roberto Vittori said.

“When I flew for the first time, I did not understand why the commander of the ship, Yuri Gidzenko, got on board and hung this thing [gnome] on an elastic band. At first I thought it was a talisman, but in fact, as soon as we took off, this elastic band began to stretch – Russians historically used to measure acceleration in this way and of course now it isn’t necessary to do this but they are very connected to their history,” Vittori said.

He added that for him it was really exciting to fly with the Russian cosmonauts.

“You live a story, you become a witness of what led to this great success,” the astronaut said.

Talking about his personal experience, Vittori said, “At first you feel a bit like an outcast, but then you discover the world of strong people and make friends for life.”

He said that despite them being real professionals and knowing exactly what is needed to be done for a better future, Russian cosmonauts were “very human and always had a direct approach which made our communication with friends and colleagues easier.”

At present, Roskosmos cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin and NASA astronauts Peggy Whitson and Jack Fisher await the arrival of the new expedition onboard the ISS.

It is expected that the crew will spend 139 days at the station."

The move comes following the US Senate's approval of a new set of sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea, which is yet to be signed by President Donald Trump.

Notably, the new legislation includes restrictive measures against Russian private individuals and separate economic sectors.

The bill also restricts the US president’s ability to unilaterally lift or ease sanctions, forcing him to seek Congressional approval. The Kremlin has slammed the new US bill as disappointing in terms of international law and trade relations.

In turn, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker stated that the EU was ready to ‘act appropriately’ to US sanctions against Russia in case they are targeting EU interests.

Radio Sputnik discussed the issue with Dr. Clara Portela, assistant professor of Political Science at Singapore Management University.

“The new bill is basically about the relations between House of Representatives, the US president and the trans-Atlantic relations, in the sense, relations between the US and the European Union,” Portela said.

She further said that this move signals that the House of Representatives wants to have more power over the sanctions and by passing a bill this will make it much more difficult for the US president to repeal the sanctions that are already in place.

“The new sanctions are meant not only to penalize the targeted countries but third parties such as the European enterprises which are collaborating together with Russia in various projects,” the analyst said.

According to her the European Union will react negatively to these sweeping sanctions.

She further spoke about how Brussels could react to the new anti-Russia sanctions, saying that back when there were sanctions imposed against Cuba by the US, they had an extra-territorial effect but the EU united together to counter those effects.

“So it is possible that the EU will take retaliatory measures against the US enterprises. However, the EU doesn’t have a tendency to over-react so at first it will be about sitting down and try to solve it peacefully,” Portela said.

The analyst further said that the EU is greatly concerned about its energy security and it wants to safeguard its autonomy so it might take some measures against the US eventually.

On Thursday, US Senate approved a bill that would impose sweeping sanctions on Russia and seeks, in particular, to target companies that invest in Russian energy projects. The bill now has to be either signed or vetoed by US President Donald Trump.

France and Germany have so far spoken out against the bill as it affects European industries while advancing US commercial interests.

On Friday, the Russian Foreign Ministry suspended the use of all US embassy warehouses and its compound in Moscow and also offered the US to cut down the number of its diplomatic staff in Russia to 455 people by September 1. Moreover, the ministry said that it reserves the reciprocal right to hit US interests in response to the US sanctions bill.

On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is behaving patiently amid sanctions, but the time will come when Moscow will be forced to respond to arrogance, adding that if adopted, the US anti-Russia sanctions bill would be an ""extra-cynical move."""

The blame was put on Houthi rebels in Yemen; however, political analyst Karine Gevorgyan doubts that Houthis carried out the attack.

The missile was intercepted 43 miles away from the Saudi city. Its fall did not cause any harm. The alliance command claimed that missiles were being smuggled into the war-torn country through the western Al Hudaydah port and under the guise of relief aid.

""The air defense forces of the Alliance in Support of Legitimacy in Yemen were able … to intercept a ballistic missile launched by the Houthi militias towards Makkah [Mecca],"" the statement carried by the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) read.

This is not the first attempt to hit the territory of Saudi Arabia. In May, the air defense shot down a missile launched by the Houthis several hundred kilometers from Riyadh.

Such attacks could be in connection to the operation that Saudi Arabia has been involved in over the past two years.

The Saudi Air Force has been involved with its Gulf Cooperation Council allies in airstrikes against Houthis in Yemen. The campaign has inflicted an estimated 10,000 civilian deaths, according to UN humanitarian officials.

Political analyst Karine Gevorgyan in an interview with Radio Sputnik said that this attack might not have been carried out by Houthis because it was meaningless for them to do so.

“This is a rather strange act. Maybe it was from despair or aimed at disrupting the hajj? But what is the point for the Houthis to set Muslims from all over the world against themselves?” the analyst said.

She further said that instead of blaming Yemeni rebels, Saudi Arabia should consider that it is possible that some oil rich regions of the country, where Shiites reside could want to take Mecca. So it could be an internal affair.

She further spoke about why it is doubtful that the alleged attack was carried out by the Houthis.

“There is a certain specificity of the situation: Houthis are fighting in small groups and there are certain agreements between them. However it is difficult to act as a unified army on a foreign territory, plus they do not have an incentive for that,” Gevorgyan said.

The analyst also said that it is possible that the information about the interception of the missile could be used by Saudi Arabia to “tickle the nerves of Iran.”

“Let's see what will be the activity of Saudi Arabia next. Most likely, all this is connected with an attempt to indirectly clash with Iran, as it supports the Houthis,” Gevorgyan said.

She further said that the US recently shot in the direction of an Iranian vessel in the Persian Gulf and that shows that there is some kind of attempt to provoke Iran, so that the nerves of the Iranian authorities are shaken."

Recently the Cabinet of Ministers of Afghanistan held a special meeting devoted to the issue of Afghan students getting involved in illegal activities during educational training in Pakistan.

The issue made it to the agenda following the recent police operation, during which 25 young people were prevented from getting sent to Pakistani suicide bombers camps.

Smugglers were planning to take children abroad under the pretext of providing them with religious education in the Pakistani city of Quetta, which is situated near the border with Afghanistan.

There are thousands of cells operating illegally across Pakistan where children are getting brainwashed into becoming radical jihadists . The Pakistani cities of Quetta and Peshawar are specially known for having such cells.

Refugees from Afghanistan, especially children, often fall victim to such cells as well.

The recent police raid operation in Afghanistan revealed that the children were young, ranging from age 6 to 14 and they were mostly orphans.

Eyewitnesses that were interviewed by Sputnik explained that Pakistani religious schools are explicit camps for the suicide army to prepare attacks, since poverty and the absence of a unified educational program in Afghanistan and the existence of unlicensed “madrassas” [religious schools] create the preconditions for recruiting young people to the ranks of militants in the territory of neighboring Pakistan.

Hadidzhe Asghar, a resident of Quetta, told Sputnik that all schools in the region are under the control of the Saudis.

In these schools, children are trained extremism and jihadism and it is here that future Taliban fighters are made.

One of the clergymen, who wished to remain anonymous, said that these camps are a special project of the British and their allies: the Pakistani ISI [intelligence agency] and Pervez Musharraf [former President of Pakistan].

In these schools, children are ""brainwashed"" , they are promised paradise gardens if they go to war with the “infidel” government of Afghanistan.

Moreover, these schools show photographs of towns and villages that have been attacked by the US Air Force and they use these photos to anger the pupils and make them take revenge by fighting the perpetrators and taking martyrdom.

Homa Alizoy, a lawyer and judge on matters of minor children, spoke to Sputnik in an interview about who is profiting from such ‘madrassas.’

“Many families, because of lack of money send their children to these free of cost Pakistani madrassas with the hope that children will be able to get an education and will also be well fed,” Alizoy said.

She further said that a huge role in financing is played by the Saudis and sometimes children are deliberately kidnapped and sent to these schools.

According to Alizoy many such schools operate in the city of Peshawar. To prevent this disaster, the Afghan government needs to work out not just a mechanism of measures, but to open more schools in the territory of Afghanistan itself with the appropriate opportunities, to attract budget and funding.

“In addition, the Organization of Hajj and pilgrims must actively join the work. One of the big problems is the rehabilitation of these children. Unfortunately, in the state there are no centers for caring for such children or institutes for psychological rehabilitation of victims of propaganda in these camps,” the lawyer said.

She further said that many, when they reach adulthood, either fall into prisons or get caught up with militants and terrorists."

Sputnik discussed with military expert Anatoly Tsyganok what could be behind the controversial statement.

Responding to a hypothetical question at a security conference at the Australian National University, Adm. Scott Swift said, “Every member of the US military has sworn an oath to defend the constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic and to obey the officers and the president of the United States as commander and chief appointed over us.”

The head of the Russian Center for Military Forecasting, Anatoly Tsyganok suggested that the reason behind this statement might be provocation with the aim of seeing the reactions of Beijing and Moscow or it may simply be rash words.

“It's either information aimed at provocation to investigate the reaction of Russia and China, or a rash military statement. Apparently, the US forgot that about 50 percent of its production is in China, and it could take appropriate steps in case of a threat or a direct attack,” the expert said.

He further said that such a non-military measure would hurt the US economy adding that China's neighbors and the US allies, South Korea and Japan will quickly find the right words to convince the US to consider the gravity of the situation, because the aggravation of relations with China will primarily affect their interests.

According to the expert, the US should also be cautious of an ally of China, the DPRK, whose troops are well prepared and ready to start military operations both against the US troops in the region and against the aforementioned US allies.

The US Pacific Fleet is one of the two main strategic forces of the US Navy. It operates in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The fleet encompasses three nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, 24 nuclear submarines and several dozen guided missile destroyers.

Commenting on Swift’s words, Vladimir Kozin, a Russian military expert and professor at the Academy of Military Sciences, noted that such statements are based on the nuclear strategy of the United States and could also be interpreted as an attempt to put pressure over Beijing.

""The US wants to force China to pressure North Korea over its nuclear program. In addition, it is a typical show of force by the US military,"" Kozin said.

He pointed out that such a statement would further push Moscow and Beijing together in military and strategic cooperation.

On July 4, North Korea announced it had successfully launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), saying it traveled 580 miles and reached an altitude of 1,740 miles during its 39-minute flight before accurately hitting a targeted area in the Sea of Japan. The test immediately prompted sharp criticism from the international community.

Following the launch, the Russian Defense Ministry disputed Pyongyang's claim, saying the missile's flight parameters indicated it reached an altitude of 535 kilometers (332 miles) and traveled 510 kilometers before falling in the Sea of Japan. However, US officials believe that Pyongyang had successfully launched an ICBM for the first time."

""It’s a US-Russia treaty so we won’t get involved with that but obviously we are concerned seeing what happens. It’s a US decision,"" the UK's head of nuclear operations for the Director General Nuclear, Commodore Paul Burke, told Sputnik.

The INF treaty prohibits the development, deployment and testing of ground-launched ballistic or cruise missiles with ranges between 300 and 3,400 miles.

The United States and Russia have repeatedly accused each other of violating the INF treaty.

The Russian Foreign Ministry earlier stated that Moscow was seriously concerned about the US’s unreasonable data regarding the treaty as a pretext for a campaign about possible retaliatory measures against Russia.

An expert of the Center for Military and Political Journalism, Boris Rozhin, in an interview with Radio Sputnik said, “There is a growing threat of further escalation of relations between the US and Russia, and this, in turn, will affect the European Union and Britain which indirectly get affected by possible sanctions or the severance of arms limitation treaties.”

He further said that the Europeans are worried that they are trying to minimize the cost of defense, and the United States, on the contrary, constantly urges to increase these costs.

“If the agreement on medium-range and shorter-range missiles is broken or will be profaned, this will force Europeans to spend more on defense. This is not in the interest of Brussels or London,” Rozhin said.

“They would like to pursue a ‘cheaper’ defense policy, shifting responsibility on the NATO structures and US troops deployed in Europe,” the analyst concluded.

In June, citing several congressmen, Politico media outlet reported that the US presidential administration was considering the US Congress's proposal to withdraw from the INF Treaty.

Russia’s Department for Nonproliferation and Arms Control (DNAC) deputy director, Vladimir Leontiev, said there was a possibility that a US withdrawal from the INF Treaty would cause an arms race.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said on more than one occasion that Moscow is in full compliance with the INF treaty.

The success of the Syrian Army and its allies is explained by the high speed of the operation, good maneuverability and the poorly organized defense of the terrorists.

The features of the mountainous terrain with its large number of heights and hidden paths were taken into account, as well.

A field commander of the Syrian Army told Sputnik, “It took 24 hours in total to break the terrorists' defense and knock them off their positions.”

As a result, the enemy's forces suffered heavy losses and lost control over the strategic routes connecting Arsal and Jurud-Fleita, through which weapons from Lebanon were supplied into Syria, the source said.

Since the beginning of the counterterrorist operation in this region, the Syrian Army has taken control of 36 square kilometers of territory, eliminating more than 70 al-Nusra fighters.

The Jurud Arsal’s topography is tough and the battle against al-Nusra Front was a challenging one, according to an anonymous source.

“Al-Nusra was entrenched in its hilltops and valleys, turning these areas into combat facilities that even airplanes couldn’t reach,” the source added.

Jurud Arsal, which is a mountainous area around the Lebanese border town of Arsal, is mostly barren, but it is home to tens of thousands of Syrian refugees who live in and around the town, some in camps.

According to the sources of the US publications, this conclusion was reached by the intelligence community of the country. Previously, it was believed that the DPRK will be able to achieve such results no earlier than 2020.

The reason for the new forecast was the recent tests, which demonstrated that in theory a North Korean missile could already hit targets as far as in Alaska.

North Korea will be able to create an intercontinental ballistic missile as early as 2018. This was reported by The Washington Post and The New York Times with reference to sources in the US intelligence.

According to the sources of the publications, the new assessment is based on recent tests of North Korean weapons; specifically the launching of ballistic missile Hwaseong-14 on July 4.

In the Pentagon it is assumed that the leader of the DPRK Kim Jong-un will receive a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile with nuclear weapons in 2018.

""North Korea's plan is running faster than we expected. We did not think that the ICBM will be tested in July, ""said one official familiar with the assessment of the US Department of Defense's Intelligence Department (RUMO).

In light of these developments, the US is becoming seriously concerned. Recently it was reported that the residents of Hawaii are preparing for a nuclear strike.

A special educational program is being carried out based on a scenario in which over Honolulu at an altitude of more than 0.3 km an explosion of a nuclear charge of 15 kilotons takes place.

​To prepare for such incidents, the US authorities also intend to create a more modern system of warning about the attack.

Ticket into the “nuclear club”

In an official statement, the head of the Department of National Intelligence for East Asia, Scott Bray said that North Korea’s recent test of an intercontinental-range ballistic missile was not a surprise.

“This test and its impact on our assessments highlight the threat that North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs pose to the United States, to our allies in the region and to the whole world,” Bray said.

According to the New York Times if the DPRK can really prepare an ICBM capable of reaching the US by 2018, this will happen before the modernization of the US anti-missile defense system.

""The danger is that the time to make a decision is significantly reduced due to the presence of weapons from North Korea, and an escalation of the conflict can occur at any second,"" the Washington Post quotes John Wolfsthal, the former senior director of the Arms Control and Non-Proliferation Agency, as saying.

The head of the National Survey of the United States, Daniel Coates, also said that the DPRK is becoming a member of the club of nations with nuclear weapons.

Coats said: “Well, they’ve got some work to do to, I think, get through the club door, but they are very persistent in achieving that goal and we see a lot of research probably gained by each launch that they do whether it fails or succeeds.”

On high alert

In a classified briefing for all the members of the chamber, the House Armed Services Committee said that North Korea’s intercontinental ballistic missile development is a risk that grows each day.

The briefing team included Rob Soofer, deputy assistant secretary of defense for nuclear and missile defense policy; Air Force Lt. Gen. Samuel Greaves, director of the Missile Defense Agency; and representatives from the DIA and the National Air and Space Intelligence Center.

“The apparent success of the July Fourth test is an alarming development as North Korea accelerates its pursuit of being able to hold the United States at risk with nuclear weapons,” Committee Chairman Rep.

Why Washington Welcomes Moscow’s Role in Resolving Qatar Crisis,[],"The US State Department has openly supported Russia's efforts in settling the diplomatic conflict between Qatar and the four Arab states led by Saudi Arabia. Numerous attempts by the United States to reconcile its Middle Eastern allies have not yielded results. What could be behind such a twist?

The United States has a positive attitude towards Russia's participation in the settlement of the political conflict around Qatar. This was stated at a briefing in the State Department by the spokesperson of the US foreign policy department, Heather Nauert.

""If Russia can play a role in helping to bring the sides to the table, I think we would welcome that. We might be skeptical of whether they’d be able to do that or not, but we would certainly welcome that if anyone were to help bring those sides together,"" she said at a regular press briefing.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview with the Kurdish Rudaw television channel on Monday that Russia was ready to assist in the settlement of the crisis around Qatar if the mediators deem it necessary.

Failure of diplomatic efforts

According to Yuri Zinin, a leading researcher at the Center for the Partnership of Civilizations of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, the US appeal to Russia as a country that can help resolve the conflict testifies to the failure of the diplomatic efforts of the United States.

""The fact that such a great power as the US was not in a position to solve this issue at this time, apparently, pushed the US to mention Russia,"" the expert said in an interview with RT.

In early July, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited Doha and Riyadh to resolve the conflict between the two most important US allies in the region. Representatives of Saudi Arabia and Qatar for the past two months alternately visited Washington, negotiating with their US counterparts.

Qatar even managed to secure an agreement on the delivery of US F-15 fighters for $12 billion, hoping that this would help resolve the crisis.

However, the diplomatic crisis still prevails and the parties are in need of assistance to resolve it.

High Stakes

According to Irina Zvyagelskaya, chief researcher at the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the US appeal to Russia for help is explained by the fact that the crisis has become very dangerous.

""Any crisis has its own logic, and the parties begin to raise the stakes,"" Zvyagelskaya said.

She added that when that happens, a point is reached when it becomes necessary to take some serious political action.

According to the expert, a stable situation in the Middle East region is very important to the US and therefore the States welcomes efforts to resolve the contradictions between the involved countries even if that leads to involving other world powers, such as Russia.

Neutral position

“In case of the failure of the Russian side, the US can also win by demonstrating the inconsistency of our claims as the role of political mediator,” Zinin said.

From the very beginning of the crisis, Russia took a neutral position. Unlike Trump, the head of the Russian state, Vladimir Putin, did not accuse either side of supporting terrorism.

Also unlike the talks with Trump, the leaders of the conflicting states have made calls to Putin in recent months, expressing an interest in Russia being a mediator.

Moreover, Mohammed bin Salman, recently crowned prince of Saudi Arabia, who is considered to be the real ruler of the state, made his first visit outside of his region to Russia and it happened just five days before the break of diplomatic relations with Qatar.

Qatar is also looking for rapprochement with Russia, as has been stated by the representatives of this country on multiple occasions.

""Russia took a neutral position from the very beginning, did not support either side. We have some influence in Qatar, and I think this applies to other countries of the Cooperation Council [i.e., the Council of Cooperation of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf]. We are interested in developing relations with Saudi Arabia, and, apparently, Saudi Arabia shows exactly the same interest; from all these points of view, Russia is a desirable negotiator,” Zvyagelskaya said.

She further said that there is one more desirable factor for Russia that the US doesn’t have and that is good relations with Iran.

“Everyone understands that the whole story is basically based on the Iranian factor and it seems to me that the fact that we have good relations with Iran was also taken into consideration,” the analyst said.

Earned Authority

The key to the fact that the countries of the region will positively perceive the strengthening of Russia's role as an intermediary in resolving the Qatar crisis is the result of Moscow's positions in the Middle East.

“In Syria, Russia took a very principled position and showed that it can realize the set tasks. Russia is almost universally recognized as a very influential power and much in the Arab world depends on Russia’s position,” Zvyagelskaya said.

Furthermore, Russia not only supports the government of Bashar al-Assad in the fight against terrorism, it is also making peace efforts to disengage forces and is supporting the negotiation format to tackle humanitarian issues.

All that, as the experts noted, is positively perceived in the Middle East."

Why Washington Welcomes Moscow’s Role in Resolving Qatar Crisis,[],"The US State Department has openly supported Russia's efforts in settling the diplomatic conflict between Qatar and the four Arab states led by Saudi Arabia. Numerous attempts by the United States to reconcile its Middle Eastern allies have not yielded results. What could be behind such a twist?

The United States has a positive attitude towards Russia's participation in the settlement of the political conflict around Qatar. This was stated at a briefing in the State Department by the spokesperson of the US foreign policy department, Heather Nauert.

""If Russia can play a role in helping to bring the sides to the table, I think we would welcome that. We might be skeptical of whether they’d be able to do that or not, but we would certainly welcome that if anyone were to help bring those sides together,"" she said at a regular press briefing.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview with the Kurdish Rudaw television channel on Monday that Russia was ready to assist in the settlement of the crisis around Qatar if the mediators deem it necessary.

Failure of diplomatic efforts

According to Yuri Zinin, a leading researcher at the Center for the Partnership of Civilizations of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, the US appeal to Russia as a country that can help resolve the conflict testifies to the failure of the diplomatic efforts of the United States.

""The fact that such a great power as the US was not in a position to solve this issue at this time, apparently, pushed the US to mention Russia,"" the expert said in an interview with RT.

In early July, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited Doha and Riyadh to resolve the conflict between the two most important US allies in the region. Representatives of Saudi Arabia and Qatar for the past two months alternately visited Washington, negotiating with their US counterparts.

Qatar even managed to secure an agreement on the delivery of US F-15 fighters for $12 billion, hoping that this would help resolve the crisis.

However, the diplomatic crisis still prevails and the parties are in need of assistance to resolve it.

High Stakes

According to Irina Zvyagelskaya, chief researcher at the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the US appeal to Russia for help is explained by the fact that the crisis has become very dangerous.

""Any crisis has its own logic, and the parties begin to raise the stakes,"" Zvyagelskaya said.

She added that when that happens, a point is reached when it becomes necessary to take some serious political action.

According to the expert, a stable situation in the Middle East region is very important to the US and therefore the States welcomes efforts to resolve the contradictions between the involved countries even if that leads to involving other world powers, such as Russia.

Neutral position

“In case of the failure of the Russian side, the US can also win by demonstrating the inconsistency of our claims as the role of political mediator,” Zinin said.

The US signaled that Turkey buying the missiles would become a major concern for Washington.

Turkish military expert Turan Oguz told Anadolu news agency that Turkey's purchase of S-400 air defense missile systems from Russia does not mean Turkey's opposition to NATO or its withdrawal from the alliance, but it does seem like Ankara seeks to ease its dependence on the alliance in the military sphere.

Speaking on the eve of a meeting of the parliamentary faction of the ruling Justice and Development Party in Ankara, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan announced the signing of documents with Russia on the delivery of the S-400 missile defense systems.

Following the announcement the Pentagon chief, James Mattis, said that the possible deal raises questions about the technical and operational compatibility of the S-400 with NATO’s standards and Turkey would have to explain for itself the choice of the Russian-made weapon.

""If Turkey decides to leave NATO in the future, at least it will not seem to be impossible militarily. That is what Ankara aims at,"" Oguz told Anadolu in a comment.

He noted that the advantages of the S-400 systems are greater than the shortcomings, and their purchase is a forced measure aimed at covering the country's needs in the foreseeable future.

Oguz also commented on the statements of the US authorities, which in recent days have expressed concern about the purchase of the S-400 by Ankara.

""It is interesting that there are fewer objections to the purchase of Russian anti-missile systems than when Ankara discussed the purchase of the Chinese FD-2000 air defense system. I think that after Turkey declares the development of a national HISAR [surface-to-air missile system] in the future, the discontent will increase. The reason for that is simple: Turkey is moving beyond the ‘permissible,’” Oguz said.

The expert further said that the S-400 would be produced in Russia and delivered to Turkey.

Turkey will not contribute to the production of the S-400, but the specialists from Russia will come and train the local Turkish personnel to operate the complex, “thus, for the first time Turkey will gain experience in using long-range SAM [surface-to-air] systems not manufactured in a NATO country and we will be able to use this experience in the future for maintenance of national systems,” Oguz said.

The negotiations on the matter between Russia and Turkey have taken place since 2016. In March, Sergei Chemezov, CEO of Russia’s Rostec Corporation, said Ankara was ready to buy the S-400 systems with a loan granted by Moscow.

On July 18, Chemezov said the technical issues of the contract for the supply of the S-400 systems to Turkey had been resolved, with only administrative ones remaining.

The S-400 Triumph is a next-generation mobile surface-to-air missile system that can carry three different types of missiles capable of destroying aerial targets at a short to extremely long range. It is designed to track and destroy various types of aerial targets, from reconnaissance aircraft to ballistic missiles.

As of today, Russia has a deal on supplying the system only with China. In addition to Turkey, talks are also underway with India."

The threat came on the eve of the 64th anniversary of the end of the Korean War, North Korean agency KCNA reported.

The North Korean Minister of Armed Forces Pak Yong-sik warned Washington on Wednesday not to “misjudge” Pyongyang, amid growing speculations of additional missile provocations.

“If the enemies follow a dangerous path of a pre-emptive nuclear attack and continue to underestimate the strategic position of the DPRK, the undefeated Revolutionary Army, … without any warning, will carry out the most fundamental pre-emptive nuclear strike in the heart of the American empire, wiping it from the face of the Earth and will finish till the end the historic reunification of the homeland,” Yong-sik said.

The minister also said that the US is plotting its own preventive nuclear strike against the DPRK, fearing the growth of the military power of this country.

North Korea and the United States are formally at war, as there was no peace treaty between them, and a cease-fire agreement in the DPRK has long been considered meaningless because of the military preparations of the US and South Korea.

North Koreans, however, believe that they defeated the United States in the Korean War 64 years ago and celebrate the day of the cease-fire on July 27 as a victorious day.

Currently, Pyongyang is intensively developing nuclear and missile weapons, conducting tests, despite the sanctions of the UN Security Council and individual countries.

The new round of hostile rhetoric comes in the wake of comments from CIA Director Mike Pompeo during the July 21 Aspen Security Forum.

“It would be a great thing to denuclearize the [Korean] Peninsula, to get those weapons off of that, but the thing that is most dangerous about it is the character who holds the control over them today,” Pompeo told The New York Times.

Pompeo did not directly state that the US or the CIA was seeking regime change in North Korea, but he strongly implied it. This provoked furor in Pyongyang.

A spokesman from the DPRK's Foreign Ministry said that the US officials are crossing the line with such statements and it “has now become clear that the ultimate aim of the Trump administration's hostile policy towards the DPRK … is ‘regime change.’”

“Should the US dare to show even the slightest sign of an attempt to remove our supreme leadership,"" the spokesman added, ""we will strike a merciless blow at the heart of the US with our powerful nuclear hammer, honed and hardened over time.”"

Speaking after her arrival at the Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg on Monday, Federica Mogherini said, ""Any difficulty, any tension, can be and must be resolved at a table, discussing, in dialogue, finding common ways, and politically.""

An expert on the Persian Gulf at the Arab Research Center in Egypt, Ahmed Talaat, told Sputnik that ""the EU has now expressed its willingness to support the negotiation processes related to the crisis around Qatar and help find a solution.”

He also said that the Europeans are ready, together with the mediators to resolve the Qatari crisis, in order to conduct a joint struggle against terrorism.

“It is necessary to use all possible diplomatic and political means to exert pressure on the countries that imposed the blockade on Qatar. We need to sit all the participants at the negotiating table. The future of the Arab region and the entire Middle East depends on this,” Talaat said.

He added that the further aggravation of the situation threatens the war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and the military intervention of Turkey in the region can further provoke tension in some countries.

Qatar has also expressed interest in resolving the crisis on multiple occasions.

Qatari Ambassador to Russia Fahad Mohammed Attiyah stated that Doha is able to withstand the ongoing blockade, but it is interested in sorting out the crisis with the four boycotting Arab states.

""That's the whole point — to come around and to have a discussion, transparent discussion on any outstanding issues, any grievances that one has. But what he [the Qatari emir] stated equally yesterday was [that] any such discussion should not come at the expense of our nation's sovereignty and should not come in the form of dictation,"" Attiyah said.

He further said that Qatar has the capacity to continue under the current circumstances until the four blockading countries start to abide by the international conventions and norms.

Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt broke off diplomatic relations with Doha in the beginning of June over Qatar's alleged support of terrorism and interference in other states' affairs. Several other countries then joined the boycott.

The demands state that Qatar should scale back relations with Iran, expel Turkish troops, stop financing terrorist organizations and fulfill several other requirements within 10 days. Qatar rejected the demands, saying they were unreasonable."

The reason for this is water. Sputnik spoke to an expert in strategic studies of the Middle East about what is behind this new dilemma and whether it can be resolved peacefully.

© AP Photo/ Hadi Mizban Why Turkish Dams Could Push the Region Toward New Conflict

Turkey plans to construct 22 new dams in the South Anatolia region but such a decision has already sparked concern among Iranian authorities, as this construction will lead to the drying up of two major water sources for Iran. However the expert thinks that Turkey is being wrongfully blamed.

Expert with the Center for Strategic Studies of the Middle East (ORSAM) Seyfi Kılıç told Sputnik in an interview that the basis of this problem lies in history, when Saddam Hussein ordered to drain the swamps around Basra in order to destroy the Shiite habitat.

He further said that this decision by Hussein ""provided support to the US occupation forces in the region after the end of the 1991 Gulf War.”

“The fact that the leadership of Tehran is repeating the words of Iraq and accusing Turkey does not help the cause,” the expert said.

In his understanding, the key to solving the problem lies not in igniting the conflict but in Tehran's changing its water policy.

“There is an impression that Iran somewhat shares the opinion of the central government of Iraq in this issue. Nevertheless, considering that after the end of the 1991 Gulf War, the Shiites in the region assisted the US occupation forces, Saddam Hussein ordered the laying of channels and draining swamps around Basra in order to destroy the area of its residence,” Kilic said.

He further said that due to such actions there was a desertification and the emergence of a large number of sandstorms in the region.

“In view of the fact that the desertification of these territories occurred during the period of the Iraqi government's rule there, it would be wrong to blame Iran and Turkey for this,” he said.

The expert further said that the Tigris and Euphrates rivers have sufficient water potential and Syria and Iraq’s current demand of Turkey is ""irrational"".

“The water reserves of these two rivers are sufficient for Turkey, Iraq and Syria when it comes to reasonable consumption. However, these reserves are not able to satisfy the irrational demands of Syria and Iraq,” Kilic said.

He also said that the fact that the problem with water supply can bring the issue of war to the agenda is fundamentally wrong, but if there is a desire to kindle a war, any reason will seem sufficient.

“I do not think that the problem with fresh water can lead to a military conflict, because there are a lot of examples in the world of resolving a large number of issues with effective use of water resources at lower costs whereas, the war is very expensive,” Kilic said.

According to the expert it is possible to resolve this problem but blaming Turkey for this is an absolutely unjustified act because Turkey, according to the 1987 protocol, leaves much of the water from the Euphrates River to Syria and Iraq.

“If Turkey pursued the goal of stalling the issue of fresh water, it would not sign this protocol. Such criticism of Turkey cannot be taken seriously,” Kilic concluded.

Earlier Iran’s head of the Department of Environmental Protection, Masoumeh Ebtekar, called on the Iranian Foreign Ministry to help convince Turkey to abandon its plans of building dams.

President Hassan Rouhani also expressed discontent with Turkey over this. Speaking at the recent International Conference on Combating Land Desertification and Dust Storms in Iran, he strongly condemned the construction of dams by Turkey."

“The fact that the leadership of Tehran is repeating the words of Iraq and accusing Turkey does not help the cause,” the expert said.

In his understanding, the key to solving the problem lies not in igniting the conflict but in Tehran's changing its water policy.

“There is an impression that Iran somewhat shares the opinion of the central government of Iraq in this issue. Nevertheless, considering that after the end of the 1991 Gulf War, the Shiites in the region assisted the US occupation forces, Saddam Hussein ordered the laying of channels and draining swamps around Basra in order to destroy the area of its residence,” Kilic said.

He further said that due to such actions there was a desertification and the emergence of a large number of sandstorms in the region.

“In view of the fact that the desertification of these territories occurred during the period of the Iraqi government's rule there, it would be wrong to blame Iran and Turkey for this,” he said.

The expert further said that the Tigris and Euphrates rivers have sufficient water potential and Syria and Iraq’s current demand of Turkey is ""irrational"".

“The water reserves of these two rivers are sufficient for Turkey, Iraq and Syria when it comes to reasonable consumption. However, these reserves are not able to satisfy the irrational demands of Syria and Iraq,” Kilic said.

He also said that the fact that the problem with water supply can bring the issue of war to the agenda is fundamentally wrong, but if there is a desire to kindle a war, any reason will seem sufficient.

“I do not think that the problem with fresh water can lead to a military conflict, because there are a lot of examples in the world of resolving a large number of issues with effective use of water resources at lower costs whereas, the war is very expensive,” Kilic said.

According to the expert it is possible to resolve this problem but blaming Turkey for this is an absolutely unjustified act because Turkey, according to the 1987 protocol, leaves much of the water from the Euphrates River to Syria and Iraq.

“If Turkey pursued the goal of stalling the issue of fresh water, it would not sign this protocol. Such criticism of Turkey cannot be taken seriously,” Kilic concluded.

Earlier Iran’s head of the Department of Environmental Protection, Masoumeh Ebtekar, called on the Iranian Foreign Ministry to help convince Turkey to abandon its plans of building dams.

President Hassan Rouhani also expressed discontent with Turkey over this. Speaking at the recent International Conference on Combating Land Desertification and Dust Storms in Iran, he strongly condemned the construction of dams by Turkey."

Sputnik discussed this issue with an Iranian environmentalist.

Iran’s head of the Department of Environmental Protection, Masoumeh Ebtekar, has called on the Iranian Foreign Ministry to help convince Turkey to abandon its plans for building dams.

As Ebtekar said, the Foreign Ministry should hold talks with Turkey to persuade the government to abandon this venture and uphold the right to the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.

Ebtekar criticized Turkey for the reckless construction of giant dams, which leads to the drying up of the rivers. As part of its ambitious project in the South Anatolia region, Turkey plans to build 22 dams.

President Hassan Rouhani also expressed discontent with Turkey over this. Speaking at the recent International Conference on Combating Land Desertification and Dust Storms in Iran, he strongly condemned the construction of dams by Turkey.

According to him, the irrational construction of these dams will lead to the disappearance of marshes and the drying up of lakes, both in Iraq and Iran. The remnants of construction work also contribute greatly to dust in the region.

The Turkish authorities, including the deputy foreign minister for South Asia, did not agree with such criticism at the conference, saying that dam construction is carried out with all precautions, norms and it cannot harm the environment.

However, Iranian environmental experts say otherwise and are quite alarmed by this. According to them, if it is not possible to stop this by the process of diplomacy, then the countries will be on the verge of a war over water.

Mohammad Darvish, the director of the public department of the Department of Environmental Protection in an interview with Sputnik said that Turkey is taking advantage of the political situation, such as the weakness of the central government in Iraq, as well as chaos in Syria to begin the construction of its 22 dams on the Tigris and the Euphrates.

“One of the dams called Ataturk is the largest dam in the world, which was built on the Euphrates River. Its volume is 48 billion cubic meters, which is equivalent to the volume of one hundred Iranian dams. If we sum up all the dams built by Turkey on the Euphrates, it measures to 100 billion cubic meters of water,” Darvish said.

He further said that if Turkey succeeds in constructing the Ilisu dam in the Hasankeyf area on the Tigris, with a volume of 10.4 billion cubic meters, then a real water crisis will erupt.

“In other words, 100 percent of the water from the Euphrates River and 60 percent of the water from the Tigris River will be blocked, nothing will come to the lands of Syria and Iraq,” he said.

The environmentalist explained that for farmers, such a catastrophe results in unemployment and poverty. Moreover, it even plays into the hands of terrorist organizations such as Daesh.

“About 90 percent of the recruits of this terrorist organization were from among the unemployed residents of these dried out and desert areas,” Darvish said.

The Iranian Energy Minister, Hamid Chitchian, also stated that the dam construction projects in Turkey ""have a great impact on the environment in Iran,"" citing the fact that they cause a chain reaction drying out the rivers.

According to him, these dam constructions have turned once fertile Iraqi farms into major sources of dust and sand storms and this has in fact affected the climate of 20 Iranian provinces."

Given the capabilities of modern precision weapons, this is a very large figure. A Russian military analyst explained why this has happened in an interview with Sputnik Radio.

Mosul residents were killed in attacks launched both by the militants and Iraqi forces as well as by airstrikes.

“Kurdish intelligence believes that over 40,000 civilians have been killed as a result of massive firepower used against them, especially by the federal police, air strikes and Isis itself,” Kurdish politician Hoshyar Zebari said.

According to Russian military expert Oleg Glazunov the number of civilian victims is just staggering. In an interview with Sputnik Radio he said, “First of all, right now, it's not World War II — there's a high-tech weapon that allows precise pin point hits.

“The US military however, does not take into account the losses because for them the main thing is to fulfill the assigned military task and make sure that no US citizens die in the process. Everything else does not matter to them,” the analyst said.

He further said that the US isn’t bothered by how many innocent civilians may die during the taking of Mosul.

“The US in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Yugoslavia did not take into account the losses of civilians either,” Glazunov said.

On July 11, Amnesty International issued a report saying that Iraqi forces and the US-led coalition were involved in killing and injuring civilians and destroying civilian objects instead of striking military targets.

The battle for western Mosul, according to the report, led to a civilian catastrophe in the city and the true death toll may never be known.

On July 9, Iraqi Prime Minster Haider Abadi declared the victory of the Iraqi forces in Mosul. The city was a key and symbolic stronghold of Daesh, which controlled the area since 2014. The operation to liberate the city was launched in October 2016.

Earlier it was stated by the United Nations that those Mosul residents who remain outside the city after its liberation may require up to $ 450 million in assistance.

According to the organization, the restoration of the city’s basic infrastructure will require a billion dollars."

The United Kingdom and Australia recently urged China to do more to pressure North Korea over its missile and nuclear program.

UK Defense Minister Michael Fallon and his Australian counterpart Julie Bishop met Thursday in Sydney to discuss the North Korean nuclear issue.

""With international influence comes responsibility. It is now for Beijing to use the influence it has over the North Korean regime to get it to abandon its program,"" Fallon was quoted as saying by Reuters.

Earlier, Bishop said in an interview with Australian Broadcasting Corp's Radio National that China ""has much more leverage over North Korea than it claims.""

""The export relationship with North Korea, the provision of remittance to workers, the foreign investment flows, the technology flows — these are all in China's hands,"" she said.

In turn, Fallon said that Pyongyang continues to receive help is developing its nuclear and missile program.

China has denied the claims, calling them the ""China responsibility theory."" According to Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang, Beijing has already been actively involved in cooperation efforts with the international community to defuse the tensions on the Korean Peninsula.

According to Konstantin Asmolov, an expert at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies, the Russian Academy of Sciences, the United States and its allies continue their pressure over China, but such an approach will not be productive.

""If they go over the top [pressuring China] their efforts will backfire,"" Asmolov said in an interview with Sputnik China.

On Tuesday, Susan Thornton, acting assistant secretary of the US State Department's East Asia bureau, said that Washington is considering new North Korea sanctions which may also target Chinese companies working with Pyongyang. The Chinese Foreign Ministry described such measures as unacceptable and said they risk undermining mutual trust between Washington and Beijing.

""This is an attempt to blatantly interfere in China’s domestic affairs,"" Asmolov said, adding that Washington’s view of the situation is wrong.

""US media misinterpreted the results of the talks between [US President Donald] Trump and [Chinese President] Xi Jinping. The Americans translated China’s politesse as a signal of its weakness and readiness to give in. Moreover, US media distributed Japanese misinformation that the Chinese president allegedly asked Trump to give him 100 days to resolve the issue in order to avoid new sanctions. But now we can see that was wrong,"" the expert pointed out.

Asmolov underscored that Beijing implements an independent approach towards the North Korean issue.

""Beijing cooperates with Washington, but will not play by American rules,"" he said.

The expert also added the claims that Pyongyang receives foreign support for its nuclear and missile program are groundless.

Meanwhile, on Friday it was reported that Pyongyang conducted another missile test launch. According to North Korea’s KCNA state news agency, the test involved the re-entry component of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).

According to the Pentagon, the missile was of the ""intercontinental"" variety and traveled approximately 1,000 kilometers before landing in the Sea of Japan. At the same time, the Russian Defense Ministry said that the missile was a medium-range ballistic missile.

The station under construction will be 3-story high and have a 36,000 square meters floor area, including platform, entrance and exit. The railway tracks will be 102 meters underground.

The station is an important part of a 12.01 kilometers long tunnel section of the 174-kilometer Beijing–Zhangjiakou high-speed railway line. The tunnel is the longest one of the railway line.

""Passengers will enter and exit the station about 100 meters underground, and it will be very safe,"" said Dai Longzhen, a senior manager of the construction company China Railway No 5 Engineering Group Co Ltd.

An escalator would raise passengers 62 meters at vertical height, and inclined elevators will also be used in the station for the first time.

To secure the safety of passengers, the station will change the inclined shafts that are used to build the station as permanent rescue channels.

The underground burrowing work is the country's most complicated, because the station has to contain 78 caverns and lots of intersections, said Chen Bin, a commander-in-chief of the project.

Starting from the construction of the tunnel on April 15, 2016, workers have known how tough the work will be, however the hardness of the rocks still exceeded their expectations, said Jiang Si, a manager of the company.

According to its initial plan, workers could excavate the tunnel 6 to 8 meters a day, but the tough rock meant workers could dig only about 2 meters a day.

Large–size shield tunneling machines could not be used, and workers could only use the blasting method in the construction, Dai said.

""The No 1 shaft has a 80-degree turn, and the No 2 shaft has a 135-degree turn, which prohibits the machines more than 100 meters long from working there,"" Dai said.

Workers have to develop new blasting technology to explore the tunnel carefully, because just above it are the Great Wall and the railway line linking Beijing and Zhangjiakou first independently designed and built by Chinese 100 years ago.

Workers have carried out more than 4,500 explosions. They use the electronic detonators to control the vibrations in batches of small explosions to reduce the impacts on the inside of hills and the Great Wall. At the Qinglongqiao station of old Beijing-Zhangjiakou railway line, worker used expansive agents to dig the tunnel, only 4 meters beneath.

Another problem in the tunneling is the underground water, and every day, workers have to pump at least 19,000 cubic meters of water, which equals about 10 swimming pools.

The Bejing-Zhangjiakou high-speed railway is expected to get through by the end of 2019, allowing passengers to travel between the two cities in one hour. It is an important project for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games.

Large–size shield tunneling machines could not be used, and workers could only use the blasting method in the construction, Dai said.

""The No 1 shaft has a 80-degree turn, and the No 2 shaft has a 135-degree turn, which prohibits the machines more than 100 meters long from working there,"" Dai said.

Workers have to develop new blasting technology to explore the tunnel carefully, because just above it are the Great Wall and the railway line linking Beijing and Zhangjiakou first independently designed and built by Chinese 100 years ago.

Workers have carried out more than 4,500 explosions. They use the electronic detonators to control the vibrations in batches of small explosions to reduce the impacts on the inside of hills and the Great Wall. At the Qinglongqiao station of old Beijing-Zhangjiakou railway line, worker used expansive agents to dig the tunnel, only 4 meters beneath.

Another problem in the tunneling is the underground water, and every day, workers have to pump at least 19,000 cubic meters of water, which equals about 10 swimming pools.

The Bejing-Zhangjiakou high-speed railway is expected to get through by the end of 2019, allowing passengers to travel between the two cities in one hour. It is an important project for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games.
