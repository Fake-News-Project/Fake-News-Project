0,cnn,US General confirms ending of program to arm anti-Assad rebels in Syria,"['Ryan Browne', 'Barbara Starr']","(CNN) A senior US general has confirmed that the US has ended a classified CIA program to arm anti-Assad rebels in Syria.

Appearing at the Aspen Security Forum on Friday, General Raymond Thomas, head of US Special Operations Command, said the decision was not made to appease Russia which supports Assad.

""From at least what I know about that program and the decision to end it, absolutely not a sop to the Russians,"" Thomas said. ""It was I think based on an assessment of the nature of the program, what we're trying to accomplish, the viability of it going forward and it was a tough tough decision.""

John Brennan, who served as director of the CIA under President Barack Obama was also asked about the decision at Aspen by CNN's Elise Labott. He did not talk about the specifics of the program, but he said the anti-Assad rebels deserve US support.

Thomas went on to offer extended comments on a number of national security and military matters at Aspen.

On the fight against ISIS, Thomas made clear the US military understands President Donald Trump wants to do more than just defeat the terror group.

""The description of our mission is pretty clear. It is now to annihilate ISIS,"" he said. ""We all got the message, in fact, we are pressing as hard as we can.""

Commanders have pointed to efforts to isolate and kill foreign fighters so they cannot escape. Thomas estimated the coalition has killed 60,000 to 70,000 ISIS fighters, but the US coalition has not confirmed that number.

Thomas offered unusually candid public remarks for a US four-star general about the capabilities of Iraqi Kurds when they first began to fight ISIS in 2014.

""I was personally disappointed with the Peshmerga,"" he said. ""Again I spent 15 months in Mosul, so I knew the Kurds very well, they talked a good game, it was a pretty army, it didn't fight very well when push came to shove. So we've had to bring them up to a level of competency that you would've have hoped was better beforehand but they are now contributing pretty actively.""

Thomas observed how the fight against ISIS has grown tougher in some respects and noted that Iranian forces and Iran backed groups are now a factor, saying ""it's also an indescribably complex environment when we are a coffee-breath close to Shia Popular Mobilization Forces riding around us, riding in M1 tanks that we provided the Iraqi army back in the day.""

Thomas even revealed that during a trip to Erbil, Iraq, his plane happened to be parked next to the plane of Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, the Iranian commander of the Quds Force.

""We bump into them everywhere,"" Thomas said of the Iranians.

On the question of the fate of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Thomas said he still is relevant as the ""iconic"" head of ISIS. But he added that ""we haven't heard from him lately, he's been an utterly ineffective leader by our assessment, if at all.""

""I monitor the same reports that everybody else does that he's dead, you know that he's not quite dead yet, he might be south of Raqqa. The bottom line is we will get him eventually, it's not safe for him on this earth for what he's done and what his organization has done,"" Thomas said.

Thomas was one of three senior US figures to state that Baghdadi is still alive on Friday, along with Secretary of State James Mattis and National Counterterrorism Center Director Nick Rasmussen.

Mattis told reporters, ""I think Baghdadi is alive. I think that he is alive and I'll believe otherwise when we know we've killed him. But we're going after him but we assume he's alive""

Rasmussen also appeared in Aspen, saying he's ""seen nothing that would lead me to believe that the leader of ISIS has been removed from the battlefield.""

Thomas went on to say, ""We have absolutely dismantled his network, I mean everyone who worked for him initially is dead or gone. Everybody who stepped to the plate the next time is dead or gone. Down through a network where we have killed a conservative estimate of 60,000 to 70,000 of his followers.""

Thomas also publicly disclosed that, in the past, US troops have come close to getting Baghdadi.

""In fact sometimes we've been closer than we know, it's just the vagaries of combat I think and counterterrorism targeting,"" he said. ""There were points in time where we're particularly close to him, unfortunately there were some leaks about what we were up to at that time."""
1,cnn,Putin is not the master of control many think he is,['Sarah Lain'],"Sarah Lain is a research fellow in Russia and Eurasia studies at the Royal United Services Institute in London. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the author.

We have also recently learned that in 2016, Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer who claimed to have damaging information on Hillary Clinton useful to the Trump presidential campaign.

The seemingly constant lack of detail and alleged breaking of protocol increases suspicion that Trump and Putin have a master plan to fix the US-Russia relationship, possibly at the expense of European security or for lucrative business deals. The contradictions and backtracking from members of the Trump team -- particularly the younger Trump's change of story over the purpose of the 2016 meeting -- adds to the lack of trust that in turn feeds the assumption for some that something far more sinister is taking place behind the scenes.

Although understandable, the nonstop US media coverage of the intrigue is also doing Putin a favor, showing a loss of faith in democratic processes and adding to the panic that the liberal elite is losing control of America.

The signs of Russian influence in the US election are clearly of grave concern. But the constant speculation and anger about how far the relationship between Trump and Putin goes only add weight to Russia's power projection in international affairs and further the mythologizing of Putin as a master of control. It creates the impression that US democracy is in crisis as a direct result of a seemingly all-powerful, foreign political entity.

JUST WATCHED At G20 dinner, Trump appeared to gesture to Putin Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH At G20 dinner, Trump appeared to gesture to Putin 00:53

It is immensely frustrating that Trump is playing by the Russian ""fake news"" rules, dismissing any truth he does not like.

Part of the difficulty comes from not knowing exactly what has been said in the Trump-Putin exchanges, thus adding to speculation that some behind-the-scenes deal-making is being done.

The obvious one would be Trump's lifting or easing of US sanctions on Russia. At the second meeting at the G20, they discussed the ban on adoption of Russian children -- Russia's response to the Magnitsky Act in 2012, which placed sanctions on individuals believed to be responsible for the death of Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who died in prison having uncovered a corruption scandal.

Trump's former national security adviser, Mike Flynn, had also discussed sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak -- something Flynn had originally denied.

Yet it is clear the Russia-US relationship has not been easily reset and sanctions cannot yet be lifted. There have been some signs of frustration on the Russian side around this. Putin showed restraint in December by not responding when the United States expelled 35 diplomats and seized two properties used by Russian diplomats, likely because there was the view that there would be a reversal once Trump was in power.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has recently raised the issue again. Not only has he threated retaliation if the assets are not returned, but also compared US pre-conditions for the return of the compounds as ""daylight robbery,"" indicating frustration that cyber-related sanctions were still in place.

The FBI investigation is not yet complete but may shed light on the ties between the two men. But this is less about Putin and Trump and more about the ways in which, particularly through financial ties, collusion and multiple levels might have taken place.

Trump is of course highly useful for Russia. But the idea that the Kremlin had a concrete plan and knew it could manipulate Trump the minute he was in power has been exaggerated and credits Putin with more power and influence than maybe even he believes in."

4,cnn,"We're a long, long, long way from a real impeachment effort",['Z. Byron Wolf'],"Go inside the decade that still seems like yesterday: CNN's ""The Nineties"" airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET/PT.

(CNN) An empowered special counsel. A White House consumed by scandal and on its heels. You don't have to make too big a leap to get from Donald Trump's White House of today to Bill Clinton's White House of the 1990s.

But there's a long way to go before we can start making real comparisons between Robert Mueller and Ken Starr or Trump and Clinton.

That doesn't mean a very few Democrats aren't trying. Reps. Brad Sherman of California and Al Green of Texas introduced an Article of Impeachment against Trump Wednesday, arguing that Trump's alleged attempts to influence former FBI Director James Comey and Comey's subsequent firing equal high crimes and misdemeanors, one of the bars for impeachment.

For starters there's no indication that Trump is anywhere near to being impeached. Only those two Democrats are officially using the word at this point. The rest of their party in Washington, for now, is more focused on Trump's policy and the coming midterm elections.

When Trump fired his FBI Director, a number of Democrats used the word ""impeachment"" and David Gergen, the noted former aide to both Republican and Democratic presidents said, ""we're in impeachment territory now.""

The idea of impeachment split Democrats in June when Sherman and Greene first brought it up. Democrats in the House sparred privately over the issue during a closed-door meeting in June, according CNN's Deirdre Walsh, who reported at the time that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was wary of Democrats getting out front of the issue instead of letting the investigation unfold.

Sherman and Green have not gained any compadres in their effort during the intervening month despite a whirlwind of developments in the ongoing saga of possible collusion between people associated with the Trump campaign and Russians.

The latest, and by far most explosive development, came Tuesday when the President's son, Donald Trump Jr., released emails ahead of publication of a New York Times story that made clear he was excited to take a meeting with Russian lawyer on the understanding that she could provide information and documents damaging to the Clinton campaign and provided, according to the emails, by the Russian government.

No definite collusion has been shown, but the emails, which were uncovered by the legal team of the President's son-in-law, are symptomatic of how special counsel investigations can work.

George Stephanopoulos , who is now a journalist for ABC News but during the 1990s was a top aide to Clinton, told CNN's Axe Files podcast recently that the Trump White House will be surprised at what it's like to work under the cloud of a special counsel investigation.

""Having worked in a White House that was under the thumb of the special counsel for several years, they have no idea,"" Stephanopoulos said.

The special counsel can also veer in wildly different directions if it finds evidence of new wrongdoing.

Stephanopoulos pointed out that Starr first got to work on his investigation ""before (intern) Monica Lewinsky came into the White House.""

""That's (Lewinsky) what ended up being what Bill Clinton got impeached over,"" he noted. ""Special counsels can go in any direction they want.""

It's not clear that Mueller will find himself so far afield. Starr was appointed under a law that has now lapsed by a three-judge panel. Mueller was appointed by acting Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump; and

any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation; and

any other matters within the scope of 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a).

That last one, by the way, is shorthand in legalese for: ""the authority to investigate and prosecute federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the special counsel's investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses; and to conduct appeals arising out of the matter being investigated and/or prosecuted.""

And that's how Starr got from a land deal to obstruction of justice, perjury and Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky.

So Mueller can look at possible collusion, other crimes he might uncover and any lying or obstruction connected with his investigation.

Starr began his tenure as special counsel in 1994 investigating the Whitewater land deal. He ended up recommending the President be impeached for lying and obstruction of justice in 1998.

It took him about four years to release the Starr report. Mueller was appointed two months ago.

Trump could, theoretically, fire Mueller if he gets frustrated by the process, but that would raise political alarm to a new level.

Impeachment would take most or all of the following elements:

A recommendation by Mueller that the President be impeached

A unified Democratic Party

A large amount of support from Republicans

That last one, in the current environment, is almost impossible to imagine. Very few Republicans would want to impeach and remove their own president.

It would be far more likely for anything on that level to occur after midterm elections, and then only if Democrats swept both the House and the Senate. That's a tall order indeed, since they are defending a majority of the Senate seats up for election in 2018.

Clinton, Richard Nixon, and Andrew Jonson, mind you, all faced hostile majorities of the opposite party controlling both the House -- which votes on a simple majority on articles of impeachment -- and the Senate, which conducts a trial and votes on a two-thirds majority on whether to remove a President from office.

Not even a Republican Senate could find a way to remove Clinton. There's no reason to think, barring some cataclysmic development, that a Republican Senate would remove Trump."
5,cnn,"Bill Bensley, luxury resort designer: It's about the fun",[],"Karla Cripps, CNN • Updated 22nd July 2017

(CNN) — When a luxury resort developer wants to create a truly spectacular property that'll be talked about for years to come, there are only a handful of designers in Asia up to the task.

Bangkok-based Bill Bensley is among the top on that list.

After nearly four decades in the business with a portfolio of more than 200 luxury hospitality properties in nearly 40 countries he's in a position to be choosy about the projects he'll take on. And there's one overlying philosophy that guides his decisions.

""If it's no fun, don't do it,"" Bensley tells CNN, his eyes lighting up with enthusiasm. ""If you're not having fun, then you're not going to do a good job. Everybody in our studio here -- 100 people -- we're all about having fun.""

It'd be hard not to have fun while working at the BENSLEY design studio, a large complex with an art deco feel that once housed Bangkok's Iraq Embassy.

It's more like a giant artistic playground than an office. Practically every room, from the fine arts studio to the architecture department, is a colorful buzz of creativity. (See the video at the top of this story for a peek inside.)

'There are no boundaries'

""There are no rules to what we do in this studio. There are no boundaries. Anyone can pick up anything.""

It's fitting, given most of projects with Bensley's involvement are often quite whimsical, places where you'll spend days marveling at the attention to detail.

The Harvard-educated American has designed a huge chunk of Asia's most incredible hotels and resorts. These include Oberoi Vilas projects in India, Four Seasons' award-winning resorts in Thailand, St. Regis in Bali and two of Vietnam's most talked about projects to date, JW Marriott Phu Quoc and the InterContinental Danang.

He's been invited to New York to be inducted into the Hospitality Designs Hall of Fame in November.





























1 / 15 Bensley says his favorite project to date is the Four Seasons Golden Triangle Tented Camp in Chiang Rai, which he designed over 10 years ago. He recently returned to design a new two-bedroom pool villa for the project.

While Bensley's whimsical stamp is increasingly being seen on projects around the world, a global outlook hasn't weakened his focus.

""What makes a project magical is the ability to finish down to the smallest detail,"" he says.

This isn't hyperbole.

BENSLEY studios is known to handle everything from uniform design, menu design, signage and graphics to even the music that people hear as they're wandering around a resort. It's fitting, given Bensley prefers to think of his work in terms of a storyline. And he doesn't focus on the trendiness of materials.

""Not a whole lot of people think like that so a lot of the hotels being built now are strictly utilitarian and don't have much soul,"" he says. ""Even if it's as simple as the story that we created 25 years ago with Four Seasons Chiang Mai -- living on a farm. It's surrounded by a rice field. It was a such a simple story but it will never go out of style.""

Operating in all design facets -- landscaping, interiors and architecture -- wasn't part of the original plan for Bensley.

""I started out just doing landscapes and I just got so tired of doing nice gardens for bad buildings,"" he says. ""What I'm trying to do that's a little bit new is to create this mesh between all of these different traditionally separate design companies, where graphic designers, landscape designers and interior designers can all come together in this place where they can work together and create a new product.""

Raiding the cabinet of curiosities

Much of the art that Bensley includes in his hospitality projects was created in his studio or handpicked during his travels.

In his warehouse, or the ""cabinet of curiosities"" as he calls it, you'll find everything from animal antlers to a spiral staircase he found in a house in Myanmar.

""Buy first, think later,"" he says, reasoning that if he comes across a unique piece he knows he'll use it somewhere eventually. ""I select, design and make things for the rooms that are very happy. That are joyful. That are representative of that place.""

Bensley says he often chooses projects based, not just on fun, but on whether he's been to a location or not. Hence the reason his portfolio includes projects in nearly 40 countries. Still on his design wish list: Japan and Morocco.

""What I like the most about [my job] is working in a new place,"" he says.

""Someplace where I can learn a new architectural language, can be challenged to try to see something through somebody else's eyes. Inspiration comes from everywhere. But mostly it comes from traveling to new places for me.""

Escapism

Set inside the InterContinental Danang, this pre-function foyer leads the all black ballroom.

Earlier this year, Bensley released the first of a series of books that showcases 26 projects in 12 countries over the last two decades.

Appropriately called "" Escapism, "" the 500-page volume features beautiful, large photographs and detailed explanations of the inspirations and design processes behind each project.

So where does Bensley go to escape? Definitely not a beach resort.

""It's funny. I've designed 200 resorts -- a lot of them are on beaches -- but you know what, the last place in the world that I want to go is go and sit on the beach. I would find that really boring.""

His vacation of choice: fly fishing in Mongolia, where he's been going to unplug for the last four years. Last year, he took 12 of his Thai staff with him.

""We're up there on the border and we don't see anybody for two, three weeks,"" he says. ""That's one thing I do every year. There's no telephone, there's no computer there. It's completely unplugged and when I come back from there I feel like I can jump over a house.""

Coming soon: A Cambodian luxury tented camp

Coming in 2018: Shinta Mani Wild, a tented camp in the wilds of Cambodia.

One of Bensley's current projects marries his philanthropy work with his passion for design. Called Shinta Mani Wild, it's part of Bensley's own Shinta Mani hotel brand.

The associated Shinta Mani Foundation , which promotes responsible tourism in Cambodia, will be spearheading the conservation and community outreach programs for the camp and provide long-term employment opportunities to those in region.

Bensley says it's his most ambitious luxury camp project to date.

Set along 1.5 kilometers of river and waterfalls, there are 16 large luxury tents perched over swift waters and waterfalls between southern Cambodia's Bokor and Cardamom national parks. It's due to open in mid-2018.

""I think this is gonna really change what a camp looks like for the whole world,"" he says. ""It's so luxurious and beautiful.""

Bear in mind this is the same man who over a decade ago kick-started the luxury camp phenomena with the Four Seasons Tented Camp Golden Triangle in Chiang Rai , which he admits is one of his favorite projects of all time. He was recently invited back to design a new two-bedroom pool villa.

So what advice would Bensley offer any budding luxury resort designers?

""I would urge anyone that's coming into hospitality for the first time to do something weird,"" he says. ""Do something different. Do something that's going to surprise people. Don't do the norm."""

8,cnn,Alila Fort Bishangarh: India's new luxury hotel,[],"Kate Springer, CNN • Updated 7th July 2017

(CNN) — From atop a granite hill, the Alila Fort Bishangarh hotel surveys the rolling hills below.

Due to open in July 2017, it's the first internationally managed property in the Aravalli mountain range, about an hour's drive southwest of Jaipur, in northern India

Built inside the 230-year-old Fort Bishangarh, this heritage address took nearly a decade to complete. It's the kind of place where you expect to find a hidden trapdoor or a spiral staircase leading to a secret lair -- a mix of raw history and mystery.

Apart from opening walls to connect rooms and making space for elevator shafts, Jaipur-based firm STHAPATYA Architects kept the entirety of the original structure intact.

""Each window and entrance portal, arches and columns, railings and jaali screens (latticed window patterns), turrets and walls ... everything had to be fully in sync with the original fort,"" Ritu Khandelwal, principal architect of STHAPATYA Architects, tells CNN. ""We were very careful in not making a 'palace' and, instead, let it reverberate the story of the fort.""

Adapting the fort

Polished anew, the powerful edifice rises from the hilltop.

Ritu and Sandeep Khandelwal, the architects behind the renovation, have been working on heritage conservation projects and luxury residences since 1994. But the Alila Fort Bishangarh was by far their most extensive assignment.

""This project is like a child to us ... and a thesis project,"" says Khandelwal.

It started nine years ago, with a careful evaluation of the fort's feasibility. The Khandelwals investigated every nook and cranny to assess its strength and stability.

""It was a maze, with bats and monkeys inhabiting its every corner,"" says Khandelwal. ""But we were intrigued! We wanted to solve the puzzle.""

Before they had even turned over a single stone, Khandelwal says the fort's character was electric.

""It was a bare, beautiful, raw old fortress, sitting in the middle of a small village of Bishangarh, untouched for years,"" says Khandelwal.

""We took our inspiration from the fort's history and carefully wove the visual vocabulary to keep it true to its original form,"" says Khandelwal.

This meant embracing Jaipur Gharana architectural elements, such as intricate lattice work in stone screens, a mix of Tudor and cusped arches, stone columns and vegetable-dye frescoes.

Digging in

The first two years were the most difficult. Every existing room and floor had a unique, unconventional layout -- making the restoration process exceedingly complicated.

""It's an organic structure, with no 90-degree angles. Every detail of the project was executed without even a single typical floor plan yet every corner of the building had a drawing,"" says Khandelwal.

Later came more obstacles -- like transporting construction materials up a hill without an existing road.

Or penetrating the 10-foot-thick walls, and the granite hill itself, to install electrical and plumbing services.

To work out the positions of the elevator shafts, the architects eventually gave up guessing and instead investigated by puncturing the floors and dropping ropes with attached torch lights.

The architects also introduced new elements, including a driveway that zigs up the hillside, a second wing for additional guest rooms, and larger windows to facilitate natural ventilation.

Simple design

A Heritage Suite at Alila Fort Bishangarh.

Polished anew, the powerful edifice rises from the hilltop. Aside from its turrets and windows and the red-ochre color -- ""gerua"" to be exact -- the hotel facade appears unornamented.

""Simplicity is the end, and not the beginning, of design,"" says Khandelwal. ""We developed clean and uncluttered interiors, weaving in ancient metal jaalis screens, antique brass embossing, block printed fabrics and hand-picked artifacts.""

From the textiles and granite to lighting fixtures and furniture, everything on site has been sourced within 60 miles, or completed by a local contractor.

""No element has been introduced that's alien,"" says Khandelwal. ""The whole building fully belongs to its setting.""

Finding talent was easy: the region is rich in craftsmanship, from carpet making to stone carving, metal crafting, wood work and stone masonry. The architects chose hand-woven carpets in neutral tones, made using various vernacular techniques, such as patchwork, block print, and tie-dye-like ""Gudri work.""

Hand-painted frescoes add color to public spaces, while wooden jewelry boxes and antiques add warmth to the rooms.

Room with a view

Relaxing ""jharokha"" style windows.

Without floor plans, each of the 69 rooms and suites has a unique shape and atmosphere. But they all have one thing in common: Windows -- some of which are built in the jharokha style -- framing exquisite views.

In the turrets, these windows offer a comfortable place to relax and take in the scenery.

""The jharokha windows are an integral part of Indian architecture,"" Khandelwal says. ""You can't omit them.""

In ancient times, women rarely left their place of residence. Instead, they lounged in these window alcoves and watched the world outside."
9,cnn,Australian cattle eat chocolate to make Wagyu beef,[],"Chris Dwyer, CNN • Updated 11th July 2017

(CNN) — It's the only flight I've ever been on where the attendant walked down the narrow aisle holding a notepad asking, ""Does anyone need a taxi booking for when we land?""

As introductions go to this quiet corner of South Australia, it speaks volumes. This is a part of the world where friendliness comes as standard, where people will do anything for a neighbor -- or a stranger. At the tiny regional airport of Mount Gambier, where only a handful of flights come and go each day, it also stretches to ensuring no one waits too long for a cab on arrival.

Mount Gambier lies almost halfway between the cities of Melbourne and Adelaide. It's the biggest town around for more than 200 miles but has a population of fewer than 30,000.

That means that there's an awful lot of countryside and coastline, providing the perfect backdrop for award-winning local produce including Coonawarra wines, rock lobster and the much sought-after sea snail known as abalone, the world's most valuable shellfish.

The region's most famed culinary export, however, is high-end Wagyu beef from cattle that are partly fed, toward the ends of their lives, on an unusual mixture of sweet treats: chocolate, candy and cookies.

Winning approach

Cattle in the Mount Gambier region have an interesting diet.

You read that right. It's a distinctive but successful approach, imparting a unique taste to the super-premium meat from Mayura Station that draws fans thanks to its remarkable flavor and lineage.

Mayura Station -- ranches are known as stations in Australia -- sits in picturesque and gently rolling green hills that are frequently carpeted in yellow flowers. It's located just a few miles from the coast, meaning cooling sea breezes offer welcome respite from the often intense heat.

An aquifer provides water purified through natural filtration through limestone caves and caverns that act as large natural filters. Combine that with the cleanest air you can imagine and consistent weather patterns, and you can see why there's a real sense of terroir. That's the French term for a location's particular ecosystem which helps make wines -- or other things such as beef -- so distinctive.

Mayura Station is an Australian ranch known for its distinctive approach to rearing cows.

Mayura Station has been farmed in some form since 1845, but today only 20 people work across the entire property of more than 3,000 hectares. It's tiny compared with some Australian cattle ranches, such as Anna Creek Station, which covers a mind-blowing 6,000,000 acres -- roughly the same size as Israel.

""Wagyu"" translates simply as ""Japanese cow."" The animals trace their lineage back to beasts of burden used for heavy labor, often in rice paddies. There are two main types, black and red, with black known as being the highest quality. Mayura Station's cattle originally came from Shogo Takeda, seen as Japan's foremost breeder and someone who has more than 50 years experience behind him.

All cattle at Mayura are full-blood Wagyu.

At Mayura the cattle are full-blood Wagyu, single source, meaning that both parents are 100% Wagyu blood. If they don't breed it on the farm, they don't sell it.

The key difference, however, compared with beef anywhere else in the world, is that for the last two months of their lives Mayura feed their animals around 2 kilograms of chocolate, cookies and candy every day.

They grow more than 70% of their regular feed on site, a mix of wheat, hay, rye grass, maize and broad beans. But the sweet mixture comes from recently expired or imperfect batches from factories, including the popular Cadbury's brand.

Unique flavor

The cows are fed on a mixture of chocolate, candy and cookies.

Up close, it smells great -- good enough to eat.

Mayura Station owner Scott de Bruin tells me to take a few bits between my fingers and try it. I assume he's kidding. But no -- and it's surprisingly moist, subtly sweet. A bit dusty, but otherwise not bad.

""When I first started feeding it to the cattle, people would say, 'your beef has this really unique flavor, we love it,' "" de Bruin says. ""I always thought it was due to the region here, or because people hadn't tried full-blood Wagyu.

""They both contribute to the taste -- but the sweet mix is undoubtedly the biggest part. The cattle just love it. They definitely know when it's feeding time!""

By the time the cattle get to eat the sweet mixture, they've stopped growing and are no longer putting on weight, so the feed is 100% about the flavor.

Resident Chef Mark Wright at work in the Tasting Room's Kitchen, at Mayura Station.

This is borne out in The Tasting Room , the simply named restaurant at Mayura Station open three days a week. The restrooms are labeled ""heifers"" on one door and ""bulls"" on the other, while cabinets on the wall feature beautiful selections of knives belonging to repeat diners.

A huge range and grill is the main draw and home to Chef Mark Wright, clearly in his element preparing some of the world's best meat. As he explains:

""From one carcass there are 32 different cuts of meat that all have very different flavor profiles and textures, so they need different styles of cooking or butchery.""

The beef is delicious -- and beautifully presented.

He plates up a succession of breathtaking dishes including a a sublime carpaccio, faultless tartare, but most of all the greatest cut of beef I'd never heard of. It's known as a ""blade"" or, in the industry, ""the butcher's cut"" -- because they know more than anyone else about the very best eating.

The whole animal is used at Mayura, in one way or another. From a 700 kilogram beast they produce approximately 300 kilograms of meat, only 30 kilograms of which are the top end cuts.

That goes some way to explaining the exclusivity -- and price -- which can reach upward of $300 per pound for their top-of-the-range Signature label. Genetics determine the all-important intense marbling that makes the beef almost more white than red, rich in omega 3, omega 6 and unsaturated fats. Not to mention the most tender you'll ever eat.

Worldwide appeal

This is one of Mark Wright's dishes, but the beef is served across the world, from Dubai to Hong Kong.

It's one thing to have cows eating candy, and some may dismiss it as cute marketing, but what does it really taste like? The last word goes to Chef Andrea Accordi at Hong Kong's Four Seasons Hotel:

""I've tried a lot of marbled meat, but sometimes the flavor isn't present. Mayura, however, gives a perfect balance of fat and meat. It's a very interesting and unique flavor, very nutty, and I feel the hint of chocolate.

""We cook it in The Lounge at Four Seasons Hotel Hong Kong between two layers of cedar wood."
10,cnn,The day the sun disappears,['Judson Jones'],"For complete coverage of the Eclipse of the Century go to cnn.com/eclipse . Watch live, in virtual reality, as the eclipse moves coast to coast on August 21st.

(CNN) In less than a month, the sun will disappear -- for a short time -- across America.

For a brief moment, day will turn to night. Animals big and small will go into their nighttime routines. Stars and planets will be visible, and streetlights will turn on in the middle of the day.

Here are some of the things you should know about the total solar eclipse happening August 21.

Don't miss it! This is rare, says NASA

""The hair on the back of your neck is going to stand up, and you are going to feel different things as the eclipse reaches totality. It's been described as peaceful, spiritual, exhilarating, shocking,"" said Brian Carlstrom, deputy associate director of the National Park Service Natural Resource Stewardship and Science Directorate.

According to NASA, experiencing a total solar eclipse where you live happens about once in 375 years. So, unless modern medicine advances considerably in the next few years, you might not make it to the next one.

The last time anyone in the United States witnessed a solar eclipse was almost 40 years ago, on February 26, 1979. It's been even longer -- 99 years -- since a total solar eclipse crossed the country from the Pacific to the Atlantic. The total eclipse on June 8, 1918, passed from Washington to Florida.

You can set your clock to it, even to the precise second.

Make your plans now. If you are reading this at work and want to ask for the day off, you will soon find that all of your science geek colleagues have already asked off for this random Monday in August. If you can't manage to convey to your boss that no one else will be doing business and you can't get the day off, block out your calendar for an outdoor meeting or a long lunch

Even if you live in New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago or Atlanta, you will go slightly dark. In fact, all of North America will be able to see a partial eclipse.

Do you have to be in 'totality'?

To see ""totality,"" in which the moon completely blocks the sun, you will need to be inside the narrow swath -- about 70 miles wide -- of the moon's shadow. The path will stretch from the Oregon coast to the South Carolina coast, with 12 states in between.

Nearly 12.2 million Americans live in the path of totality, but NASA predicts that millions more will visit it that day. ""About 200 million people (a little less than 2⁄3 the nation's population) live within one day's drive of the path of this total eclipse,"" the agency said.

""This will be like Woodstock 200 times over -- but across the whole country,"" said Alex Young, solar scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.

The Federal Highway Administration is calling this a ""planned special event for which there has been no recent precedent in the United States.""

It expects heavy traffic before and after the eclipse along the path of totality. The agency suggests getting to your chosen spot hours before, if not the day before. The one thing you don't want to do is come up short of totality.

""This is one of those rare events where being close is not good enough,"" said J. Kelly Beatty, senior editor of Sky & Telescope. ""A sun that's 99% covered is vastly different than the one that's 100% covered. Like I say to people, it's like being on a first date versus being on your wedding night.""

Most astronomers have the same advice: Get to the path of totality, because you won't want to miss this.

""I know it's a Monday and for some parts of the country a school day, and it may be inconvenient or cost more than you want, but it really should be a priority,"" said David Baron, author of the book ""American Eclipse."" ""The general impression is, if you live somewhere with a 90% partial eclipse, that's good enough. Absolutely not. It's only during a total solar eclipse that you can take off your eclipse glasses, look up where the sun should be with your naked eye and see a sky you've never seen before.""

A fast-moving shadow

During a total solar eclipse, the moon and the sun both appear to be about the same size from the ground. According to NASA, this is a ""celestial coincidence,"" as the sun is about 400 times wider than the moon and about 400 times farther away.

Then, it is just basic geometry. When the Earth, moon and sun line up just right, the moon blocks the sun's entire surface, creating the total eclipse.

If you happened to be sitting on the moon facing Earth, it would look just like the moon is casting a dark circular shadow -- called the umbra -- on the Earth. This shadow will move across the United States from west to east, but don't think about trying to keep up with it.

Unless you are flying a fighter jet, you won't be able to follow the shadow, which will be traveling at almost 3,000 miles per hour when it enters the US and then slow to nearly 1,500 mph when it traverses South Carolina.

A larger and fainter shadow called the penumbra will surround the inner shadow. This is what most people will experience -- the partial eclipse.

Precision timing

The lunar shadow first crosses the West Coast at 9:05 a.m. PDT.

People in Lincoln City, Oregon, will be the first in the continental United States to see the total solar eclipse, beginning at 10:15 a.m. PDT.

A total solar eclipse can sometimes take as long as 7½ minutes. The longest eclipse duration for this event will occur in Carbondale, Illinois, and will clock in at two minutes, 43 seconds, beginning at 1:20 p.m. CDT.

Eventually, all good things must come to an end, and the lunar shadow will depart the East Coast at 4:09 p.m. EDT.

This will be the last total solar eclipse in the United States until April 4, 2024

It's not quite as long of a wait as you might have thought, but it won't stretch the width of the country. Instead, it will move from Mexico to Maine and then traverse New Brunswick and Newfoundland."
11,cnn,Raising a good person in a digital world,"['Sierra Filucci', 'Common Sense Media']","As parents, we have many hopes for our kids. We want them to grow up to live happy, successful lives. We hope they'll find love, maybe have kids of their own, and pursue their dreams. But at the bottom of all these wishes is the hope that our kid turns into a decent human being -- someone who is kind, respectful, and honest.

How do you bolster these strengths as well as teach key skills such as teamwork, communication, and perseverance? For the most part, kids will learn these things by following your example and through experience gained at school and in their communities. But media is another entry point. Since movies, TV shows, books, video games, and social media are such a huge part of kids' lives, it makes sense that kids can learn important lessons about character through media.

Here are some specific things you can do or say to reinforce character:

Watch sports.

Not only can watching sports with kids be a really fun way to bond over a favorite team or player, it can be a perfect opportunity to point out character strengths from teamwork to perseverance. After cheering over a big touchdown or basket, point out how important the linebackers or passers were to the score: Even though they don't get all the attention, the team wouldn't be successful without the admirable work of supporting players.

Share social media.

From Facebook and Instagram to YouTube, social media is ripe with character lessons. If you notice a post, photo, or video of something especially touching or beautiful, share it with your kid and comment on how much courage it took for the poster to share their story or creative expression.

Discuss the risks involved with putting yourself out there and how important it is to take (reasonable) risks to be true to yourself, even though you might face criticism.

Expand your horizons.

Watching documentaries or movies about people who live very different lives can trigger empathy, compassion, and humility. During a family movie night, choose something out of the ordinary -- a story about someone of a different race or religion, or about a community that's less fortunate than yours, or a subculture with different values or beliefs than yours -- and encourage discussion afterward.

Play video games together.

Gaming as a family offers the chance to practice teamwork, problem-solving, communication, and perseverance, while also having fun. Choose multiplayer games where gamers are required to work together to win. Model positive, respectful communication during the game (try ""I need help over here"" instead of ""you idiot!""). If kids are trying over and over again to achieve a game goal, you can recognize their effort as well as their success.

Take a time-out.

Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.

Most households are abuzz as various mobile devices alert us to text messages or Instagram posts. But we can help teach our kids self-control by resisting the urge to respond immediately. Next time you hear a text message alert (and you know it's nothing urgent), say out loud, ""I don't need to check that right now."" This lesson can work on social media, too. If you're a Twitter or Facebook user and you see something that makes you mad, talk through with your kid why you don't want to respond right away (""I might say something I regret because I'm upset"" or ""I'd rather tell my friend that this bothers me privately instead of publicly on Twitter"")."
12,cnn,Eric Holder: This is how you fix a broken Congress,['Eric H. Holder'],"Eric H. Holder served as the 82nd Attorney General of the United States (2009-2015). He is the Chairman of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

Our Founding Fathers envisioned a Congress that would faithfully represent and be accountable to its constituents. In 1788, James Madison wrote in ""Federalist No. 57:"" ""Such will be the relation between the House of Representatives and their constituents. Duty, gratitude, interest, ambition itself, are the chords by which they will be bound to fidelity and sympathy with the great mass of the people.""

Today, Congress has become unbound to the ""great mass of the people."" The House recently passed a health care bill that only 16% of the public supports , according to a recent poll. A narrow majority in the House rushed to pass the bill without any meaningful debate and the Senate is considering similar legislation. Whether it's healthcare or countless other issues, voters want one thing, but Congress does the exact opposite -- or nothing.

How did Congress become so untethered? Looking at how the US House districts were drawn gives us great insight.

Extreme partisan gerrymandering reached new levels during the 2011 redistricting process . Propelled by precision targeting technology and special interest funding, Republicans drew maps in state after state that packed Democratic voters into bizarrely shaped districts and protected Republican incumbents. Despite winning fewer than half of all votes for the House, Republicans still walked away with 55% of House seats in 2016.

With fewer competitive congressional seats, members of Congress are incentivized to serve narrow, partisan interests. This creates a Congress driven by primary party politics and ideological extremism, not one accountable to the will of the majority of voters.

Unfortunately, the American people are living with the result of this broken Congress: increased partisanship, government shutdowns, the birth of the Freedom Caucus , and a Congress that refuses to hold President Donald Trump accountable.

That's not only bad for Democrats, it's bad for democracy.

So how do we go about fixing our democracy? We know from our history that the future is built by those who show up and by those who engage, resist, and overcome. That has been the story of America -- from the framers who planned a revolution, to the abolitionists who embraced emancipation; from the workers who fought for a decent wage, to the women who reached for the ballot; from the marchers who demanded their civil rights, to the activists who secured marriage equality for all of us. Today, once again, millions of people of strong will and good faith are asking what they can do for the country they love.

That's why, this January, we launched the National Democratic Redistricting Committee (NDRC) in order to draw district lines in a fair manner.

With the NDRC, Americans will have a chance to fight back, regain our democratic voice, and fix our democracy. After the data from the 2020 census is released, states around the country will draw new maps that will shape our Congress for the next decade. Every state has its own rules for drawing Congressional districts , but most rely on collaboration between the governor and the state legislature.

The NDRC is a new effort to create more representative districts with a targeted, state-by-state strategy. Our strategy involves four key components: overturning illegal gerrymandering in the courts; winning critical state elections; investing in ballot initiatives on redistricting; and building the infrastructure for the 2021 redistricting process.

We've already seen major progress. Over the last several years, the Supreme Court and other federal courts have struck down illegal gerrymandering in North Carolina Virginia , and Florida . And more states may soon follow, with ongoing cases in Texas and Wisconsin . These cases have already produced fairer maps -- and led to two new African-American members of Congress in 2016.

We know there's a long path ahead. But the work of ending illegal gerrymandering is critical to the future of our democracy. We have an opportunity -- and an obligation -- to fix a broken Congress and to build the kind of nation that speaks with our voice, the voice of the diverse and compassionate community that America has been, that we are, and that we can be once again. It will be up to all of us to embrace that challenge in the service of the more perfect Union that all Americans deserve."
13,cnn,Brazilian plane takes on an American military icon,['Thom Patterson'],"Perched in the cockpit of one of the newest military aircraft in the world as it streaks through the sky, I've got a front row seat for a Brazilian sales pitch aimed at unseating an American icon.

Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer (ERJ) brought its all-new prototype jet-powered KC-390 military cargo hauler to the Paris Air Show to woo the world's military brass and convince them it's time to give up Lockheed Martin's C-130 Hercules.

The C-130 is the world's longest-running production aircraft and the preferred workhorse of the U.S. Air Force. There are just over 1,100 military and civilian C-130s flying today that will eventually need to be replaced. Embraer wants to fill those spots.

""We do respect the competition"" from Lockheed (LMT), said Embraer's chief executive, Paulo Cesar de Souza e Silva. ""It's now time to have something newer and we are there for that.""

The development of the KC-390 is also part of Brazil's broader ambition to be a bigger industrial player on the world stage.

Better known for its small commercial airliners, Embraer has, until recently, avoided going head-to-head with bigger manufacturers like Boeing (BA) and Airbus (EADSF).

""In some ways, this jet is a proxy to Brazil's rise as a global power,"" says to a report by Richard Aboulafia, Vice President of Analysis at the Teal Group, an aerospace consultancy.

The nearly 61-foot-long cargo deck of the new KC-390 can carry anything from armored vehicles and troops to humanitarian supplies and aerial refueling equipment. Zipping along at 300 mph and 15,000 feet above the French countryside, it's hauling journalists for the first time.

Heavily updated little by little over the years, the U.S. Air Force is flying the latest model of the C-130J Super Hercules.

It has new engines and avionics, but the aircraft is the same basic shape that is has flown more than 23 million flight hours over 60 years -- 1.6 million for the C-130J alone.

And the U.S. military's stamp of approval is no small hurdle to overcome.

That's ""more than just a product endorsement,"" Aboulafia said. It's a guarantee that spare parts will be plentiful around the globe and the C-130 will continue to be upgraded for decades to come.

Both the KC-390 and Lockheed's Hercules are designed to land on short, unpaved dirt or sand runways, and their engines can withstand the beating from rocks and dust.

Related: Five airlines want you to fly supersonic again

But the faster jet-powered KC-390 has a 140-mph speed advantage over the 400 mph, four-propeller driven, Hercules. Embraer says the KC-390 can haul up to 50,000 pounds of cargo on its 19-foot longer cargo deck - about 6,000 more than Lockheed's plane.

Perhaps most essentially, Embraer thinks it can replace the C-130 for less money.

The estimated price for each KC-390 would range between $50 million to $55 million, according to a 2016 report from the Teal Group -- around $15 million less than the Hercules.

It's ""a fantastic cargo box for the price,"" said Aboulafia.

Embraer is betting that politicians and taxpayers will give the KC-390 an advantage.

But Lockheed's motto is ""the only replacement for a Herc is another Herc.""

The Brazilian rival may be less expensive, but there are attributes of the Herc that it can't match.

The C-130's straight wing can get it off the ground faster in battle with more troops or cargo.

""If you're looking for combat lift, I think that the Herc's just going to have an advantage,"" Aboulafia said. ""If you're looking to simply deliver stuff from one airfield to another, the KC-390's probably going to have better economics.""

Currently only two experimental KC-390s are flying, and the airlifter is still being tested, so it will be a while before it can declare victory."
14,cnn,Breast cancer: The 'other' genes that raise risk,['Jacqueline Howard'],"(CNN) When Samantha Golkin-Nigliazzo was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 30, she wasn't surprised. Instead, it was the results of her subsequent genetic tests that left her in shock.

Though only about 7% of women with breast cancer are diagnosed before the age of 40, Golkin-Nigliazzo knew that she had a genetic risk of the disease.

""Because of my family history, I expected to be diagnosed at some point,"" said the New York-based real estate attorney. She's now 34 and said she's cancer-free.

Samantha Golkin-Nigliazzo and her husband ran the New York City marathon in 2014 to raise money for breast cancer research.

Her mother, Judy Golkin, was diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer at 33 and died of the disease at 35. Golkin-Nigliazzo started to get screenings for breast cancer annually in her early 20s. Some experts recommend that those with a family history begin screening 10 years before the age of the earliest diagnosis in the family.

In 2013, an MRI screening at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York revealed signs of cancer in Golkin-Nigliazzo's right breast. She then had a spot mammogram and biopsy performed.

The next day, Golkin-Nigliazzo received a phone call from her doctor.

""She said, 'We found some malignant cells.' That's what she started off with, and everybody knows that's breast cancer,"" Golkin-Nigliazzo said.

Because of her family history, Golkin-Nigliazzo was tested after her diagnosis for mutations on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancers in women.

The tests came back negative.

'I am one big genetic question mark'

""Based upon the science of 2013 and what was tested for in my full genetic panel, my results did not identify any genetic mutations that would have increased my risk for breast cancer,"" Golkin-Nigliazzo said, adding that doctors classified her as having familial breast cancer because no genetic mutations were detected.

""I was more surprised to hear my genetic results rather than my own diagnosis, because I assumed I inherited some kind of genetic mutation that would make me susceptible to developing breast cancer,"" Golkin-Nigliazzo said. Additionally, behavioral and environmental risk factors had been determined to be unlikely.

""So right now, I am one big genetic question mark,"" she said. ""We don't know all of the genes that have an effect on cancers, but I know that with the amazing research that is being done by geneticists, when my daughter is old enough to take advantage of genetic testing, there will be more genes to test, and we will be able to learn more about our genetic risk.""

Golkin-Nigliazzo, the mother of an 18-month-old daughter, said she has enrolled as a participant in a number of studies at Memorial Sloan Kettering's research lab on unknown genetic mutations that may increase breast cancer risk.

One reason why the new mom has decided to participate in research is because of her daughter, she said.

Samantha Golkin-Nigliazzo, shown with her husband, David Nigliazzo, and their daughter.

""When I found out I was having a little girl, I knew I would be passing on my familial risk of breast cancer. Being able to participate in these studies is my own way of helping researchers identify the genes that affect breast cancer risk in many women, including my daughter,"" Golkin-Nigliazzo said.

""I hope that genetics (research) takes us to the next level so that she knows all of her risks and is able to really conquer cancer head-on if that's something in her future,"" she said. ""There's something in my blood that's genetically predisposing myself and my family to the disease, and one day, I'm hopeful that science will uncover that.""

But what's the likelihood of carrying such mutations?

Researchers are getting a step closer to answering that question, especially in Jewish women like Golkin-Nigliazzo.

'There are dozens of other genes'

A new study of 1,007 women of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry who had been diagnosed with breast cancer found that a whopping 903 had none of the widely known mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.

Rather, among those 903 women, 31, or 3.4%, carried a damaging mutation in lesser-known genes that are related to breast cancer. And seven, or 0.8%, carried a different mutation on BRCA1 or BRCA2 than what's widely known.

""I am an Ashkenazi Jew, and I personally found this article to be particularly fascinating,"" Golkin-Nigliazzo said.

The study involved data and DNA from the New York Breast Cancer Study , a previous analysis of breast cancer patients known to carry genetic mutations from a dozen major cancer centers in New York between 1996 and 2000.

The DNA samples were sequenced, and the researchers targeted 23 established and candidate breast cancer genes, including BRCA1 and BRCA2.

The researchers found that overall, 142, or 14.1%, of the women carried a germline mutation responsible for their breast cancer, which broke down to 11% in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes and 3.1% in CHEK2 or another breast cancer gene.

However, the study had some limitations, including that only those genes known or suspected to harbor breast cancer-related mutations were sequenced and considered for the study.

Also, more research is needed to determine whether or how the findings could be applied to non-Jewish populations.

""This paper is part of an ongoing quest to identify women at high risk for breast cancer,"" said Dr. Matthew Ellis, professor and director of the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center at Baylor College of Medicine, who was not involved in the new study.

""We are inexorably moving towards a world where there will be widespread, even universal, genetic screening to risk-stratify patients for early diagnostic techniques, such as mammography and MRI and for surgical intervention,"" he said. ""This paper is a further step in that direction by looking beyond BRCA1 and 2, as there are dozens of other genes that, when abnormal, also increase breast cancer risk.""

The researchers wrote in the study that Ashkenazi Jewish patients with breast cancer can benefit from testing for all breast cancer genes.

JUST WATCHED Testing for breast cancer genes Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Testing for breast cancer genes 01:57

""Approximately half of the patients with a damaging mutation in any breast cancer gene did not have a family history suggesting inherited predisposition,"" the authors wrote. ""Therefore, to limit genetic testing to patients with a suggestive family history is to miss about 50% of patients with actionable mutations.""

""The most recent national screening guidelines recommend genetic testing for all Ashkenazi Jewish patients with breast cancer,"" the authors wrote. ""This recommendation is fine, but testing women only after they develop cancer severely limits the power of precision medicine.""

'Needle in a haystack is an understatement'

Though more inherited genetic mutations associated with breast cancer have been identified in recent years, the scientific understanding of those mutations and how they impact patients needs to be more fleshed out, Ellis said.

""The biology behind each one of these genes and the epidemiology is becoming increasingly well-understood,"" he said. ""Although for now, I would say we're still struggling with this in clinic.""

Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.

For instance, when one of the rarer genetic mutation diagnoses is made, there are still many questions about what type of guidance should be provided to a patient, he said.

""Should you take (the hormone-blocking drug) tamoxifen? Should you have your mastectomies? Or should you just have more frequent screening?"" Ellis said. ""Each one of these gene abnormalities is a separate diagnosis. It's a different gene, a different biology, and it might take a different approach. So there's an awful lot of work ahead of us.""

Golkin-Nigliazzo hopes work in the field of breast cancer research might hold clues to the familial breast cancer that she and some of her relatives have been diagnosed with.

For treatment, Golkin-Nigliazzo decided to have a double mastectomy, a procedure in which both of her breasts were removed. Her father, Jeffrey Golkin, and now-husband, David Nigliazzo, stayed by her side during her appointments and surgery.

Golkin-Nigliazzo's diagnosis came four months before her wedding, but after her treatment, Golkin-Nigliazzo had her dream December wedding , a traditional Jewish ceremony with New York elegance and Gatsby-inspired glitz.

Since the cancer was detected early, Golkin-Nigliazzo said, ""finding the breast cancer at 30 was empowering rather than scary, because I knew that I had done what I needed to do to make my chances of survival as high as possible.""

Now, Golkin-Nigliazzo is cancer-free and living in New York with her husband and their 18-month-old daughter. She serves as the secretary of the board of directors for The Pink Agenda , a nonprofit that raises money for breast cancer research, and couldn't be happier.

""The fact is, researchers are just scratching the surface and making breakthroughs in genetics every day,"" Golkin-Nigliazzo said.

""To say that identifying a genetic mutation that increases breast cancer risk is like finding a needle in a haystack is an understatement. The human genome is incredibly complex,"" she said. ""There are no known genetic mutations associated with my genetic background, but that doesn't mean that there aren't any out there."""
15,cnn,The guru's gift: Staying calm in a world of chaos,['Jessica Ravitz'],"New York (CNN) They arrive by the hundreds, walking through metal detectors, placing their belongings on conveyor belts to be X-rayed.

They're passing through intense security in search of serenity.

It's a warm New York evening, and these seekers are streaming onto the North Lawn of UN Headquarters to take part in the International Day of Yoga, a mass celebration of a discipline believed to date back thousands of years.

Among them are seasoned yogis in matching outfits who stand on their heads to relax. A landscape contractor in jeans kicks off his work boots and admits he's never done this before. A mother brings her two young children, determined to give them a break from their iPads.

Sirens and traffic roar along nearby streets as a guru from halfway around the world takes the stage with his right-hand colleague and other like-minded guides.

For at least a few hours, Rishikesh has come to the Big Apple, and I'm here to reclaim something I once found.

On mats dotting the UN's North Lawn, participants try to block out city noise in search of peace.

Rushing toward tranquility

A sea of pedestrians moves me along. Surrounded by strangers, many wearing earbuds or staring at gadgets, I cross against reds, too impatient to stop and stand still.

Yoga on the lawn is still 24 hours away, but I can't wait.

I'm off to see two people who once helped change my life. They're spiritual leaders from the largest ashram in Rishikesh -- one of India's spiritual hot spots -- and they're here to carry the message of yoga's power.

Hindu pilgrims have long made their way to Rishikesh, considered the birthplace of yoga -- and the yoga capital of the world. So have Westerners seeking enlightenment, ever since the Beatles went in 1968 to study Transcendental Meditation with the late Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.

I went for several weeks in 2014 to write about those who flock there, what they're searching for and what they find. What I didn't see coming was a transformation of my own, one that freed me of long-held hurts and opened my heart in new ways.

That gift stayed with me for a while. But 8,000 miles away and three years later, ugly politics, threats from social media trolls, even the mundane challenges of rush hour gridlock can chip away at tranquility.

There's no tranquility for the man on a bicycle who screams obscenities at the taxi driver who cut him off. Or the woman who groans and rolls her eyes when a slow-walking tourist blocks her path.

The honks of cars sound an urban symphony as I turn the corner toward the building where my Rishikesh friends are staying.

I stroll by the tony Plaza Hotel, peer up at addresses along Central Park South and pass a Trump property. I laugh to myself, thinking about the contrast between where they've come from and where they've landed.

Nearly 3,000 people registered to take part in International Day of Yoga activities at the UN.

'Face your book'

The first time I spoke with Swami Chidanand Saraswatiji, we sat on thin mats atop a cow-dung floor inside the ashram he leads in the foothills of the Himalayas.

This time, inside a devotee's apartment, the floors are pristine marble, and we sink into designer furniture while overlooking Central Park.

Swamiji, as I came to know him, wears saffron robes, and his smile is as gentle and warm as I remember. He places his hands over his heart in greeting.

We speak about what he hopes to convey during this trip, and his wisdom and gift for wordplay is still evident:

""The internet can take you to the world of information, but the 'inner-net' can take you to the world of inspiration.""

""Going on Facebook is not enough. You have to face your book also. When you face your book, you know where you stand.""

""Whether you're becoming bitter or better, whether you're in peace or in pieces ... you have to watch. You have to introspect.""

I learn that this man, who spent eight years of his childhood meditating alone in a jungle, has been to New York City 90 times -- but has never visited the Statue of Liberty. I can't help but ask what he makes of this chaotic concrete jungle.

""Chaos is not outside of us; chaos is inside of us,"" he answers. ""In the chaos also you can find calmness. In the midst of the noise also you can be noiseless. That's what yoga gives you.""

This sounds great, but what if the world around you, the work you do, the tensions of your nation fuel your anxiety? How can you possibly find calmness or manage your stress?

Focus on ""self-management,"" Swamiji, 65, says with a knowing grin. ""All is not well until you are well. Simple!""

I tell him I need to work harder to follow his advice.

""Rishikesh,"" he answers. ""Recharge your batteries and come back.""

Swami Chidanand Saraswatiji traveled from the mountains of the Himalayas to the skyscrapers of Manhattan to help lead the festivities.

Interrupting the calm

It was easy to stay grounded in a place where my days revolved around yoga classes, meditation, meetings with holy men in caves and sessions with gurus. But holding on to what I felt in Rishikesh ebbs and flows back home, which is what brings me to the UN's North Lawn.

Tables are covered in products that promise fulfillment. There's a cookbook for the body and mind, a stack of Ayurvedic soaps for holistic cleansing and a copy of ""Meditation & Mantras"" by Swami Vishnu Devananda.

People get situated on their yoga mats. But before they embrace stillness, they bat around the names of their favorite studios, pass around pamphlets for retreats and offer CDs bearing titles like ""The Miracle of You.""

A woman wearing a hijab sits, legs crossed and eyes closed. A businessman in a suit can't resist glancing at his phone and tiptoes away to make a call. Another woman begins to weep while thanking the manager of a Catskills ashram for changing her life.

On the stage overlooking the lawn, Swamiji sits cross-legged in his chair. He's joined by other yoga experts, a kirtan master and musician, a spoken-word performer and Sadhvi Bhagawati Saraswati, a woman he works with who's become his sidekick of sorts.

Sadhviji, as I call her, emerged a friend and a touchstone during my time in India.

Originally from Los Angeles, Sadhviji has called Rishikesh home for more than 20 years.

She shares Swamiji's spiritual outlook as well as his commitment to protecting the environment. She also directs the International Yoga Festival each year at their ashram, Parmath Niketan.

She speaks of yoga's ability to promote balance, an ethical life, and physical and mental well-being. How one gets to yoga -- through meditation, chanting or physical exertion -- is less important than getting there.

""Yoga,"" which translates to ""union,"" is ""the union of my breath to my body, the union of the self to the divine,"" Sadhvi Bhagawati Saraswati said.

She likens it to the sacred river Ganga, or the Ganges, which is believed to give life, rejuvenate and liberate. It changed her from the moment she arrived in Rishikesh and dipped her feet in the water.

It doesn't matter if you walk into the Ganga from a sandy beach, step into it from marble steps or leap into it from a rock, she says. ""The goal is to get in. It's the same with yoga.""

Across the North Lawn, the crowd of seekers follows the cues from the teachers on stage, closing their eyes, bringing themselves into the moment.

My eyes remain open as I take notes, and between their moments of calm, I feel the vibrations of my work phone as new emails come in.

The seekers follow instructions, drawing energy toward their spines and connecting ""to the universal energy of the breath.""

My phone vibrates, alerting me to a bombing in Brussels.

They twist their bodies into triangle pose, exhale slowly and relax.

My phone reminds me of Otto Warmbier, the American who died the day before after being released from North Korean custody.

They pray for peace and listen to reminders to ""meet hate with love, meet fear with compassion.""

My phone prompts memories of Michael Brown, the unarmed black 18-year-old whose wrongful death lawsuit has just settled.

""Be a yogi that dares to care about the happiness and freedom of all beings without exception,"" one of the teachers says to those assembled.

My phone tells me more about Nabra Hassaneen, a Muslim teen who was killed near a Virginia mosque days before.

Between ceremonies and talks, under the guidance of yoga experts and spiritual leaders, New Yorkers reached for balance.

Fluffing my aura

Sadhviji and I exchange texts the next morning. I hope to steal some time with her and Swamiji before my flight home.

I feel like I need more, that there are questions I still want answered. I don't even know exactly what I want to ask, but anything else they can give me, I'll take.

The wi-fi seems to be down, and my cell is running out of juice. I pack up, count my electronics -- two phones, a laptop, a FitBit -- but don't seem to have enough chargers.

The results of a special election back home bring a flood of Facebook posts, replete with expletives and testimonies of tears. My phone buzzes: It's my chiropractor and massage therapist, reminding me it's time for a tuneup. On the television, morning news pundits debate the future of health care in the US.

I imagine that while all of this goes on, Swamiji is deep in meditation and completely unfazed.

I return to the UN to attend a ""Conversation on Yoga for Health,"" but also because I'm told I can meet with Swamiji after the talk. Security won't let me on the chamber floor, though, so I sit in my seat up above and watch.

A woman beside me, visiting from California, offers me her CD of music and a link to her website. She calls herself a ""Shamanatrixx"" and is in the business of promoting a ""Love.o.lution."" She hands me an ""aura fluffer"" wand, colorful feathers connected to a looped pipe cleaner. By waving it around my head and body, she shows me, I can offer myself kindness and compassion. She hopes it will make me smile. It does; I can't stop grinning.

Swamiji and Sadhviji are joined by other headliners, including an acclaimed Bollywood actor, a CEO who's brought mindfulness to the workplace and a former NFL player-turned-yogi. An official from the World Health Organization lays out yoga's benefits, how it helps reduce high blood pressure, strengthen pulmonary function and prevent depression and stress.

Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.

Swamiji, who likes to say ""meditation is the best medication,"" recalls the saints who lived in caves in the jungle where he meditated as a boy.

""No Pizza Hut, no Starbucks, no Amazon.com -- nothing was available,"" he says. ""Nothing was set in their lives ... but personally, they were set. Their minds were set; their hearts were set; they were happy all the time.""

And as a result, he says, their health was set. What he sees today is a world in need of an adjustment.

""In our lives, everything is set, but we are upset,"" he says. ""What is the key to being set and healthy in body and mind? The answer and the secret is yoga.""

We don't need to retreat to caves in the mountains above Rishikesh to find the answers, he says. ""You can create your own cave right here.""

The session ends, and people swarm around them on the chamber floor. I stand from my seat and watch. I'm too far to reach them and know, given my flight back home, that I won't have time to wait.

But I also realize I don't require any more guidance from my Rishikesh teachers. These past few days have reminded me: What I need is already inside me.

So with my ""aura fluffer"" in hand, I walk back onto the city streets, where I stop at every red light, stand still, smile and breathe."
16,cnn,This musician strummed a guitar during his own brain surgery,['Sugam Pokharel'],"(CNN) Guitar players can strum almost anywhere, from a beach to a park bench to an operating room -- while undergoing brain surgery.

That's where Abhishek Prasad peddled his musical wares during a four-hour surgery in India that aimed to correct cramping in his fingers, his surgeon said.

For 20 months before the July 11 procedure, Prasad had suffered from a neurological condition called musical dystonia, said Dr. Sharan Srinivasan, head neurosurgeon at the Bhagwayn Mahaveer Jain Hospital in Bangalore.

""This is a form of a task-specific movement disorder, which comes out only when playing a musical instrument,"" he said. ""In his case, ... it was the cramping of three fingers, middle, ring and little, on his left hand because of the misfiring circuits in his brain.""

Whenever Prasad played the guitar, his fingers would get stuck. Not anymore.

""It was a magical feeling, completely magical,"" the 37-year-old musician said of the first chords he played after the operation. ""I wasn't able to play for the past 20 months, and in a few seconds, my fingers were completely released, and I was able to play normally.""

""You have been struggling for 20 months to do something and just in a few seconds, you are able to do that normally, how would you feel? It was magical, it was heaven.""

'Radio-frequency ablation'

Srinivasan performed ""radio-frequency ablation"" under local anesthetic to correct the condition, a treatment he had trained for in Japan, he said.

Dr. Sharan Srinivasan performed ""radio-frequency ablation"" to correct a condition known as musical dystonia in his 37-year-old patient.

The treatment uses radio-frequency currents to destroy the part of the brain circuit triggering abnormal tremors.

After fitting a frame to Prasad's head and using a special MRI scan to map his brain, Srinivasan's team relied on Prasad's reactions to pinpoint the exact area that required burning, the surgeon said.

""This is why the patient has to be fully awake during the surgery,"" Srinivasan said. ""He has to give me a real-time feedback.""

""As I am entering the brain, I'm stimulating the brain at various levels to make sure I'm in the right location, I'm not in the wrong location,"" he said. ""Once I confirmed that I'm there, then I started burning the circuits with radio-frequency currents.""

Prasad's real-time response was critical.

""As I'm doing it, he kept playing the guitar and he is seeing his fingers releasing,"" his surgeon said.

Local anesthesia used

Awake brain surgery dates to ancient times, when doctors sometimes drilled into patients' skulls, presumably to relieve seizures or headaches, according to the National Institutes of Health , or NIH. In the late 1920s, a surgeon in Canada added pain killers and local anesthesia to the practice, which gained popularity in treating brain tumors and epilepsy.

Srinivasan took extra precautions to ensure Prasad was not in pain, he said.

""He was only under local anesthesia, which means wherever I made a cut in the skin, I give an injection, so that he doesn't feel the pain,"" he said. ""The brain itself has no pain, only the skin or the top of the skull that is painful.""

Neurosurgeon Dr. Sharan Srinivasan visits with Abhishek Prasad after the guitar player's brain surgery.

""Patients think they have a psychological problem,"" Srinivasan said. ""They don't know it's a neurological circuit issue that can be fixed.""

Prasad stayed in the hospital for three days after the surgery and is doing well, his surgeon said.

He plans to release his first song next week -- on the guitar, of course."
17,cnn,"Kawagoe -- the Japan of your historic, samurai dreams",[],"Mike Nakada, CNN • Updated 21st July 2017

(CNN) — Tight streets lined with gabled buildings and tiled roofs -- it's an image many visitors, particularly those of an older, pre-Pokemon vintage, hope to find when they come to Japan for the first time. Sadly, with most Japanese cities having the architectural appeal of a pile of gray cardboard boxes, it's an image they never truly find.

The truth, however, really is out there. It lies not in Kyoto, Nara or any of the other celebrated ""historic"" towns, but in a little city right on the doorstep of Tokyo.

Kawagoe City in Saitama Prefecture has preserved an area of streets lined on both sides with buildings that look like they've been taken straight from a samurai period drama. Kawagoe is only 50 minutes from Shibuya and affordable to reach.

This means that travelers on a tight schedule and budget can enjoy sights that most think are reserved for the pricier private tours round Kyoto. And we think Kawagoe is much the better bet for the truly curious traveler in Japan anyway.

History buff's bus

Jump on this classic bus to tour Kawagoe.

The best way to get around is on the Koedo Loop Bus , a retro-styled bus that runs around Kawagoe's historical spots. This bus runs every 20 to 30 minutes, and you can pick it up at the west exit of Kawagoe Station. Make a right once you get out of the station; the bus stop is right next to the phone booths.

You can buy a one-day pass inside the bus and language is no barrier, which we can't say about many of Japan's tourist destinations.

All buses are equipped with screens showing the next stop in English, plus there are copious English announcements, so there's no worry about getting lost. Wheelchair-accessible buses also operate frequently.

Here's a best-of itinerary for Kawagoe's historic downtown:

For whom the bell tolls

First up, we suggest hopping on the bus and taking it to the Kura-Machi bus stop (E14). This is the main street of the historical area and is lined with stores built in the kura-zukuri or ""storehouse"" style -- a popular form of architecture during the Edo Period from 1603.

Head toward the signal and cross over to the right-hand side. Turn around and head down the street and you'll find splendid examples of traditional Japanese architecture among stores selling anything from arts and crafts to tasty treats.

Yume Kurodo, located right after the first crosswalk without a signal, sells some oh-so Japanese souvenirs. These include Japanese-style umbrellas, fans and noren split curtains which cost much more pretty much anywhere else in the land.

Right next door you can taste freshly roasted rice crackers in more flavors then we ever imagined existed in a biscuit -- miso paste, hot pepper, citrus and more -- at Terakoya Honpo.

The great bell tower known as Toki No Kane (Bell of Time) is located on the same side of the street. This tower is an exact replica of the 17th-century original and continues its role as the symbol of Kawagoe and also notifies citizens of the hour four times a day. We guess most take the olde-worlde thing seriously and shun watches.

Turning things around, when you come to the large bank, cross to the other side of the street and walk back up the way you came.

Candy fantastic

Japanese Storehouses Street in Kawagoe

One store not to miss on this side is Yuzen, a one-stop shop for all your chopstick needs. And who doesn't need chopsticks?

Here, you can get your name engraved in English on a pair of handcrafted chopsticks for no extra charge while you wait.

The backstreets located right off the main street are also real gems. Wandering around these streets is like what many imagine exploring Kyoto will be like before they get there and hit the walls of massed tourists.

Kashiya Yokocho (Candy Store Street) is lined with old-fashioned candy stores overflowing with an excellent selection of Japanese sweets.

Nearby is the Kawagoe Festival Museum . The museum showcases the giant wooden floats used in Kawagoe's nationally revered fall festival, each standing over five meters tall and decorated with intricate carvings from folklore.

From here you can head to the bus stop to return to Kawagoe Station or, if you've got more time, continue your journey on to Kitain Temple. In the latter case, you'll need to take the bus to Kitain (E5) and enter the grounds through the main gates, near the bus stop.

Shogun's choice

Expect a stony reception at Kitain Temple.

The Tokugawa clan, rulers of Japan for over 200 years, were patrons of Kitain and also of Kawagoe. In fact, the third Tokugawa Shogun loved the place so much he moved the reception hall and study from his castle in Edo to the temple grounds in the 1600s.

These are some of the only surviving structures from the original Edo Castle , which burned down multiple times over the centuries before being replaced by the current Imperial Palace in Tokyo.

Kitain is also known for its 533 statues of Buddha's disciples. Every one of these statues is unique; some sit in meditation, some weep and some look like they're just having a great time.

After that, the world -- or at least Kawagoe -- is your oyster. You can take the bus back to the station from Kitain or make another circle to explore this amazing, and still relatively undiscovered, city a little more.

Getting there: Take the express on the Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line from Shibuya heading for Kawagoe-shi or Shinrin Koen and get off at Kawagoe Station. Be sure to take the train heading for Shibuya on the way back. It takes approximately 50 minutes."
18,cnn,One-month sugar detox: A nutritionist explains how and why,['Lisa Drayer'],"(CNN) If you've read about the latest wellness trends, you may have entertained the idea of a diet detox.

But whether you've considered juicing, fasting or cleansing in an effort to lose weight or improve your well-being, you're probably aware that drastically cutting out foods is not effective as a long-term lifestyle approach to healthy eating.

In fact, strict detoxing can cause issues including fatigue, dizziness and low blood sugar.

But there is one kind of sustainable detox that is worthwhile, according to some experts. Reducing sugar in your diet can help you drop pounds, improve your health and even give you more radiant skin.

""Sugar makes you fat, ugly and old,"" said Brooke Alpert, a registered dietitian and co-author of ""The Sugar Detox: Lose the Sugar, Lose the Weight -- Look and Feel Great."" ""What we've discovered in the last couple of years is that sugar is keeping us overweight. It's also a leading cause of heart disease; it negatively affects skin, and it leads to premature aging.""

Sugar addiction

Here's more bad news: We can't stop consuming sugar. ""People have a real dependency -- a real addiction to sugar,"" Alpert said. ""We have sugar, we feel good from it, we get (the feeling of) an upper, and then we crash and need to reach for more.""

About 10% of the US population are true sugar addicts, according to Robert Lustig, professor of pediatrics and member of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California, San Francisco. What's more, research suggests that sugar induces rewards and cravings that are similar in magnitude to those induced by addictive drugs.

One of the biggest concerns is the amount of added sugars in our diets, which are often hidden in foods. Although ice cream cake is an obvious source of sugar, other foods that may not even taste sweet -- such as salad dressings, tomato sauces and breads -- can be loaded with the white stuff.

""People don't realize that seemingly healthy foods are loaded with sugar -- and so we're basically eating sugar all day long, from morning till night,"" Alpert said.

How to sugar detox: Going cold turkey for three days

The good news is that even if you're not a true sugar ""addict,"" by eliminating sugar from your diet, you can quickly lose unwanted pounds, feel better and have a more radiant appearance.

""There is no one person who wouldn't benefit by eliminating added sugars from their diets,"" Lustig said.

Children can benefit, too. Lustig's research revealed that when obese children eliminated added sugars from their diets for just nine days, every aspect of their metabolic health improved -- despite no changes in body weight or total calories consumed.

But going cold turkey is what works best, at least in the beginning.

""Early on in my practice, when I would notice that people had real addiction to sugar, we'd start trying to wean them of sugar or limit their intake or eat in moderation ... but the word 'moderation' is so clichéd and not effective,"" Alpert said. ""It was just ineffective to ask people to eat less of something when they're struggling with this bad habit. You wouldn't ask an alcoholic to just drink two beers.

""What was so successful in getting my clients to kick their sugar habit was to go cold turkey. When they would go cold turkey, I wasn't their favorite person -- but the number one positive effect was that it recalibrated their palate,"" she said. ""They could now taste natural sugars in fruits, vegetables and dairy that they used to be so dulled to.""

So for the first three days on a sugar detox, Alpert recommends no added sugars -- but also no fruits, no starchy vegetables (such as corn, peas, sweet potatoes and butternut squash), no dairy, no grains and no alcohol. ""You're basically eating protein, vegetables and healthy fats.""

For example, breakfast can include three eggs, any style; lunch can include up to 6 ounces of poultry, fish or tofu and a green salad, and dinner is basically a larger version of lunch, though steamed vegetables such as broccoli, kale and spinach can be eaten in place of salad. Snacks include an ounce of nuts and sliced peppers with hummus. Beverages include water, unsweetened tea and black coffee.

Though they don't contribute calories, artificial sweeteners are not allowed on the plan, either. ""These little pretty colored packets pack such a punch of sweetness, and that's how our palates get dulled and immune and less reactive to what sweetness really is,"" Alpert said.

Consuming artificial sweeteners causes ""you not only (to) store more fat,"" Lustig explained, ""you also end up overeating later on to compensate for the increased energy storage.""

How to sugar detox: When an apple tastes like candy

Once the first three days of the sugar detox are completed, you can add an apple.

""By the fourth day, an apple tastes like candy,"" Alpert said. ""The onions are sweet! Almonds are sweet! Once you take sugar away from your diet cold turkey, your palate recalibrates, and you start tasting natural sugars again.""

Starting with day four, you can add one apple and one dairy food each day. Dairy, such as yogurt or cheese, should be full-fat and unsweetened. ""Fat, fiber and protein slow the absorption of sugar, so taking out fat from dairy will make you absorb sugar faster,"" Alpert said.

You can also add some higher-sugar vegetables such as carrots and snow peas, as well as a daily serving of high-fiber crackers. Three glasses of red wine in that first week can be added, too.

During week two, you can add a serving of antioxidant-rich berries and an extra serving of dairy. You can also add back starchy vegetables such as yams and winter squash.

For week three, you can add grains such as barley, quinoa and oatmeal, and even some more fruit including grapes and clementines. You can also have another glass of red wine during the week and an ounce of dark chocolate each day.

""Week three should be quite livable,"" Alpert said.

Week four is the home stretch, when you can enjoy two starches per day, including bread and rice, in addition to high-fiber crackers. Wine goes up to five glasses per week.

""You can have a sandwich in week four, which just makes things easier,"" Alpert said. ""I want people living. Week four is the way to do it.""

Week four defines the maintenance part of the plan -- though intentional indulgences are allowed, such as ice cream or a piece of cake at a birthday party. ""Because the addictive behavior is gone, having ice cream once or twice will not send you back to square one,"" Alpert said. Additionally, no fruit is off-limits once you've completed the 31 days.

""The whole purpose is to give people control and ownership and a place for these foods in our life,"" Alpert said.

Benefits and cautions with slashing sugar

Detoxing from sugar can help you lose weight quickly. ""We had over 80 testers from all over the country, and they lost anywhere between 5 to 20 pounds during the 31 days, depending on their weight or sugar addiction,"" Alpert said. ""Many also noticed that a lot of the weight was lost from their midsection. Belts got looser!""

Participants also reported brighter eyes, clearer skin and fewer dark circles. They also had more energy and fewer mood swings.

""I have lost approximately 40 pounds following the sugar detox,"" said Diane, who preferred not to share her last name. She has been on the plan for approximately two years.

""I thought I was educated on weight loss, but like many, I was miseducated, and by reducing fat, I was really just adding sugar. With the elimination of sugar, including artificial sweeteners, it is incredible how sweet foods tastes.""

Diane added back some healthy fats into her diet, which keeps her feeling satisfied. And her sugar cravings disappeared. ""This is probably the longest I have remained on a plan, and I don't feel like this will change. It just feels natural and normal.""

There are challenges and medical considerations before starting, though. Since the first few days of a sugar detox can be challenging, it's important to pick three days during which your schedule will be supportive.

""Depending on how intense your addiction is, you can experience withdrawal symptoms, such as brain fog, crankiness and fatigue,"" Alpert said. Lustig found that the children in his study experienced anxiety and irritability during the first five days of eliminating sugar and caffeine, though it eventually subsided.

""If you feel bad, stop and have a piece of fruit. But if you can push through and stay well-hydrated, you can really break your cycle of sugar addiction,"" Alpert said.

It's important to note that the plan may not be appropriate for diabetics, extreme athletes or anyone taking medication to control blood sugar. It is also not recommended for pregnant women.

Finally, before starting a sugar detox, enlist the help of friends and/or family members for support. ""You need people around you to help you be successful,"" Lustig said. ""The whole family has to do it together."""
19,cnn,Congress reaches Russia sanctions deal,"['Jeremy Herb', 'Deirdre Walsh']","Story highlights The legislation will give Congress a new ability to block the administration from easing sanctions on Moscow

The House will vote on the bill on Tuesday

(CNN) The House and Senate reached a deal Saturday to slap Russia with fresh sanctions and give Congress new veto power to block any easing of those sanctions -- an agreement that could send a new bill to President Donald Trump's desk before the end of the month.

House and Senate negotiators announced an agreement was reached Saturday morning for a bill that would include new sanctions against Russia, Iran, and North Korea.

Despite the White House lobbying for changes to the measure, the legislation will give Congress a new ability to block the administration from easing sanctions on Moscow. Democrats and some Republicans have expressed concerns that Trump is considering giving Russia back two compounds in Maryland and New York that were seized by the Obama administration in December.

""Given the many transgressions of Russia, and President Trump's seeming inability to deal with them, a strong sanctions bill such as the one Democrats and Republicans have just agreed to is essential,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. ""I expect the House and Senate will act on this legislation promptly, on a broad bipartisan basis and send the bill to the President's desk.""

The House will vote on the bill on Tuesday, according to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's schedule, and the Senate is likely to take it up after that, although Senate leaders haven't said when they will bring it to the floor. Congressional aides say they expect Trump will sign the bill because it will likely pass both chambers with strong, veto-proof majorities.
