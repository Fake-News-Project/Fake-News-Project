Today, it hosts an international airport and is undergoing a jetset-lifestyle renaissance thanks to its new superyacht marina.\\n\\nPorto Montenegro , a massive redevelopment of the old naval base and shipyard, is a burgeoning tourism hub, drawing in huge foreign investment and the international nautical community.\\n\\nTip: It\\'s impossible to miss the regal It\\'s impossible to miss the regal Regent Porto Montenegro hotel, an elegant boutique building occupying a strategic corner of the marina.\\n\\nCoffee and cake refueling stops are a must here, before visiting the Naval Heritage Collection museum.

Sveti Nikola\\n\\nAn offshore island languishing in the Adriatic Sea sunshine, lush and uninhabited Sveti Nikola is Montenegro\\'s largest island.\\n\\nWith deer as the only permanent residents, it\\'s a popular getaway for locals and tourists in the summer, who cross on regular boat ferries from Budva.\\n\\nA small 16th century church, Crkva Sveti Nikole sits in the island.\\n\\nTip: It\\'s known locally as Hawaii, but don\\'t be fooled. There are no sandy beaches. But the waters are warm and rocky shores have a raw charm. A water taxi from Budva costs €3 return per person for the 10 minute crossing. Food and drink is available on the island. Look out for deer roaming freely and fish lapping at the feet.\\n\\n19. Blue Grotto Cave, Lustica Peninsula\\n\\nAs light hits the waters, it refracts emitting a luminous shade of blue, giving the Blue Grotto its name. Swimming or boating in these vibrant waters feels magical. Blue Grotto is on cruise ship itineraries, so summers can get busy.\\n\\nTip: Visit during off-peak time where possible, when there\\'s nothing better than grabbing an oar and kayaking into the 9-meter tall cave, without the hefty summer tourist throngs. Kotor Bay Tours have group itineraries by boat with skipper.\\n\\n20. Mount Orjen\\n\\nThe highest mountain on the Adriatic coastline is a Dinaric range of limestone straddling Montenegro and Bosnia & Herzegovina. The slopes are a haven for skiers in winter and trekkers in summer, with a range of activity levels and trails.\\n\\nFrom Herceg Novi, there are mountain huts with information on trails and accommodations. The Coastal Mountain Traversal path is an epic 180-kilometer trail from Mount Orjen to Bar. Help can be arranged with guides and routing via the Mountaineering Association of Montenegro.'"
