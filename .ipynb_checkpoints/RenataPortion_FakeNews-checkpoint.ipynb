       "'“New York City, NY – According to the New York Post, arrest rates in NYC fell by 66% year-on-year for the week starting December 22nd. This decrease has been attributed to disgruntled police officers frustrated with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who remains at odds with police union chiefs following the fatal shooting of two NYPD officers last week in Brooklyn, Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu.\\n\\n“Officers Ramos and Liu were killed in an ambush shooting by Ismaaiyl Brinsley on December 20th. Brinsley, a 28-year-old man with a history of mental health problems, had posted on his Instagram feed that he planned to kill two police officers to avenge the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, both unarmed African-Americans killed this year by police.\\n\\n“De Blasio declined to endorse a grand jury decision not to indict the officer responsible for Garner’s death and has been sympathetic to the wave of protests against policy impunity that followed.\\n\\n“Hundreds of officers turned their backs as De Blasio spoke at Ramos’s funeral in Queens on Saturday. The funeral for officer Liu will be held on Sunday; Liu was reportedly the first Chinese-American officer to be killed in the line of duty.\\n\\n“Why would we continue to do our jobs with the treatment we’re getting?,” said Jonathan Crews, 34, an NYPD officer, and added: “we’ve got no support from those who should be supporting and standing up for us the most, and it all makes us wonder why the hell we’re still doing this job.”\\n\\nHe further added: “we all have families to feed and bills to pay; that’s why we’ve decided to go with the climate created by those in power. From now on, we’ll only arrest white people, since it’s obvious that going after everyone equally just isn’t working for the politicians. So, if the people start noticing a decrease in crime in NYC, they’ll know it’s because the NYPD has stopped arresting blacks altogether.”'"

       "'The US Africa Command (AFRICOM) will investigate whether US forces knew about allegations of the abuse of prisoners by Cameroonian forces on a military base where US troops were present.\\n\\nJennifer Dyrcz, captain of AFRICOM, said, \"We are aware of the 2017 Amnesty International report alleging illegal detentions and abuse of prisoners by Cameroonian soldiers and are currently reviewing its contents,\" according to Stars and Stripes. \"US Africa Command has ordered that an inquiry be conducted into these allegations. As the inquiry is ongoing, we can’t provide specific details about what that entails.\"\\n\\n© AP Photo/ Leslie Pratt, US Air Force US Extends Drone War Deeper Into Africa With New Base in Cameroon\\n\\nThe command says that to date it has not received any reports about possible abuses by Cameroonian elements from US forces.\\n\\nDyrcz said that servicemembers are required to notify leadership of any \"possible, suspected or alleged violation of the law of war for which there is credible information during the conduct of operations.\"\\n\\n\"These reports are required to be made promptly to the chain of command in the most expeditious means possible,\" she added.\\n\\nThe inquiry will determine what information the command was aware of prior to the investigation, if any.\\n\\nIn a July 20 report, Amnesty International wrote that between March 2013 and March 2017, Cameroonian security forces violated international human rights laws by torturing prisoners they suspected of being involved with the Boko Haram extremist group.\\n\\n© REUTERS/ Emmanuel Braun US to Train Rapid Reaction Force in Cameroon to Fight Boko Haram\\n\\nVictims told the human rights agency that they were severely beaten, put in \"agonizing stress positions,\" and claimed that some were even tortured to death. The organization reported that torture occurred at 20 sites, including facilities operated by intelligences agencies, a school, military bases and a private residence.\\n\\nUS troops were accused of being party to the abuse in the report, but the organization acknowledges that there are questions as to whether they knew abuse was taking place.\\n\\nCameroon hosts a US drone base and the US military maintains a minimal presence there, while also training with Cameroonian soldiers alongside French forces in the fight against Boko Haram. Despite being based in northern Nigeria, the terrorist group has has been launching attacks across the border in Cameroon.\\n\\n\"I saw white men in Salak many times and I heard them talking in English, I think they were Americans.\" one prisoner said in the report, \"I saw them running from the back window of my cell, especially in the morning, as well as standing in front of our cell, just where the garage was. Some were wearing plain clothes, others were in uniform. The uniform was like camouflage clothing, green and beige.\"\\n\\nAmnesty International Regional Director for West and Central Africa Alioune Tine remarked,\"“Nothing could justify the callous and widespread practice of torture committed by the security forces against ordinary Cameroonians … These horrific violations amount to war crimes.\"'"

       "'Share Facebook\\n\\nTwitter\\n\\nStumbleupon\\n\\nWhile President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner has been taking heat from liberals and the media for allegedly suggesting “back channel” communications with Russia during the presidential transition, reports have surfaced that Trump’s predecessor also thought a back channel was necessary.\\n\\nExcept for President Barack Obama’s administration, it wasn’t just a suggestion, as the group actually had a secret communication line with Moscow that it used to discuss Russian operatives attempts to infiltrate U.S. election software, according to Bloomberg.\\n\\nIn its efforts to deescalate the cyber threat, the Obama White House used what has been called a cyber “red phone,” which wasn’t actually a phone at all, but instead was a secure messaging channel designed to send urgent messages and documents between the two governments.\\n\\nThree sources close to situation told Bloomberg that in October, after a series of attacks on several state election systems, the White House reached out to Moscow on the back channel to offer evidence of the hacking and to warn Russian President Vladimir Putin that the attacks could cause conflict between the two countries.\\n\\n“International law, including the law for armed conflict, applies to actions in cyberspace,” said part of a message sent over the back channel on Oct. 31, a senior U.S. official told NBC. “We will hold Russia to those standards.”\\n\\nAs part of its use of the “back channel,” the Obama administration, according to Bloomberg, contacted the Russians in October “to offer detailed documents of what it said was Russia’s role in election meddling and to warn that the attacks risked setting off a broader conflict.”\\n\\nn other words, the Obama administration told the Russians what it knew or suspected about the country’s computer activities — which basically told Russian security services what the United State didn’t know about Russia, too. An intelligence agency couldn’t ask more cooperation from its target country.\\n\\nNaturally, Russia responded by asking for more information and providing assurances that it would look into the matter.\\n\\nIt was reportedly the first time the Obama administration had used the secure messaging line between Washington and Moscow, although the main system had been in place for more than 50 years and in 2013, Obama added the channel for specific communications regarding cyber incidents.\\n\\nTrump critics contend that there is an important difference between Kushner’s back channel versus Obama’s — that Kushner was simply a part of the president-elect’s transition team, while Obama was actually the U.S. president. But, the whole point of a presidential transition team is to smooth the path for the incoming administration — and that includes dealing with foreign governments, whether friendly, hostile, or somewhere in between.\\n\\nBesides, the liberal media’s narrative has been that Kushner’s request was problematic because of who he wanted to talk to on the back channel, not necessarily the timing of it.\\n\\nAs it turns out, the liberal administration Trump defeated wanted to talk to the same person on a secret channel, too.\\n\\nLike and share this article on Facebook and Twitter if you think the liberal media is hypocritical for attacking Jared Kushner’s Russian back channel request while President Obama’s administration did the same thing.'"

       "'President Donald Trump’s son Eric insists he was placed in control of his father’s business because of his talent. In a candid interview with Forbes, the younger Trump admitted that nepotism got him into a position in his father’s business. But he says his father handed over the management of the Trump Organization to himself and his brother Don Jr. because of their successes. “Nepotism is kind of a factor in life,” Eric claimed. “We might be here because of nepotism, but we’re not still here because of nepotism. You know, if we didn’t do a good job, if we weren’t competent, believe me, we wouldn’t be in this spot.”\\n\\n“And besides,” he continued, “if we’re being honest, I have to point out that the fact that I’m being asked this question is kind of borderline offensive. I mean, I understand that my father is not your typical president of the country that comes from politics and all that, but I view that as his advantage instead of the other way around. That being said, do you think it’s fair to suggest that I’m incompetent simply because my father is who he is or because I was born as the son of Donald Trump? At the end of the day, you don’t get to pick your family; the only thing you really get to pick in your life is what you do with it.”\\n\\nPresident Trump’s heir also said, “On the other hand, I don’t see other children of wealthy families being asked this question, do you? Therefore, the very fact that I’m being indirectly accused of serving as the head of my father’s business simply because I’m his son is rude in my book. And even if that were true – if I was only his son and nothing else – I could very easily run everything he’s worked so hard for into the ground. But, that’s the thing – that would hurt him and nobody else in this country. As a matter of fact, I think it’s about time we stopped insulting my father and started applauding him for the magnificent work he’s been doing since he became president.”\\n\\n“You want to talk nepotism? How’s this: if I were the average American, which I still think is an awesome thing to be, I would not only support Donald Trump’s work as the president of the country, but I would also encourage him to hire as many of his family members as the leading team of all his companies and enterprises for one very simple reason,” the president’s eldest son revealed. “Donald Trump is a self-made billionaire who managed to become the president of the greatest country in the world, and did it all thanks to his hard work. As an American, that’s the kind of gene pool I’d want running the country 24/7 if you ask me.”\\n\\n“I think forgiving and, what’s more, encouraging nepotism in the White House as well as the Trump family is the perfect way Americans can repay my father for the awesome pro-bono work he’s been doing as president so-far. Because, let’s not forget: we’re talking about a billionaire here. Being the President of the United States is all fine and dandy, but waking up in the morning and going for a dip in your very own pool of cash is even better. So, pro-bono work is something my dad has gone to great lengths to achieve and he doesn’t mind doing it. Plus, he’s paid a higher tax rate than former president Obama. Combined with the volunteering he’s doing at the White House, I think that’s as charitable as it gets,” Trump’s son concluded.'"
