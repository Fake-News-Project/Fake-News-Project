Trump Says Trumpcare Is Not Dead, Unless GOP are 'Quitters'"

Earlier in the day Trump used Twitter to declare that Republicans “look like fools” a day after they failed to pass a ""skinny"" health care plan, which he followed with threats to insurance companies and lawmakers.

“If a new HealthCare Bill is not approved quickly, BAILOUTS for insurance Companies and BAILOUTS for Members of Congress will end very soon,” he said in a Saturday morning tweetstorm.

After seven years of ""talking"" Repeal & Replace, the people of our great country are still being forced to live with imploding ObamaCare! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2017

If a new HealthCare Bill is not approved quickly, BAILOUTS for Insurance Companies and BAILOUTS for Members of Congress will end very soon! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2017

The Trump administration already cancelled $5 million in HealthCare.gov ads that advertised the upcoming enrollment season, and the president is now threatening to withhold federal payments that help reduce insurance premiums — particularly for low-income people — and keep companies in the market.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer claimed that Trump was putting his thumb on the scale and toying with the lives of millions.

“If the President refuses to make the cost sharing reduction payments, every expert agrees that premiums will go up and health care will be more expensive for millions of Americans,” Schumer said in a statement. “The president ought to stop playing politics with people's lives and health care, start leading and finally begin acting Presidential.”

Trump also used Twitter on Saturday morning to blast the Senate rules that require 60 votes to overcome a legislative filibuster after Senate Republicans failed to pass a “skinny” version of its health care plan.

Senate rules state that three-fifths of the Senate must agree to end the debate over a piece of legislation and move to a vote, which is known as invoking cloture. A group of 61 senators from both parties sent a letter to Senate leaders in April that stated their opposition to eliminating the legislative filibuster.

Republicans had avoided a filibuster in the first place by attempting to pass health care through budget reconciliation, which limits their actions to only impacting costs or taxes. Budget reconciliation only requires 51 votes and doesn’t provide an opportunity for a filibuster — but the tactic also greatly hampered the GOP’s ability to change the law.

The president declared on Saturday morning that the Senate must get rid of the rule because “It is killing the R Party, allows 8 Dems to control country.”

He added in a later tweet that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell must “go to 51 Votes NOW and WIN. IT’S TIME!”

McConnell has previously dismissed such demands from the president, who said in a May 2 tweet that the country needed to “either elect more Republican Senators in 2018 or change the rules now to 51%” or the country would need to undergo “a good ‘shutdown’ in September to fix mess!”

According to Trump’s Saturday tweets, Democrats were “laughing at R’s” and would dismantle the filibuster if they “ever got the chance.”"

You get home from a hard, long day at work and that bottle of rosé you bought last weekend is calling your name. The problem? It's sitting in your wine rack, warm and undrinkable. Your internal Veruca Salt is screaming, ""I want my wine — and I want it now!"" Don't panic — or stash the bottle in the freezer for the next 45 minutes. We've got a better way.

Jeff Rossen, NBC News National Investigative Correspondent and host of Rossen Reports, has two too-good-to-be-true tricks for getting that bottle of wine chilled and in your wine glass or on the table — stat.

The Paper Towel Method

How long? 15 to 20 minutes

Step 1: Take a few sheets of paper towels and run them through some water.

Step 2: Shake off the excess water and wrap the towels around the bottle.

Step 3: Pop the bottle in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes and — presto — your bottle is perfectly chilled.

The Ice Bath Method

How long? Two minutes (seriously)

Step 1: Create an ice bath in a bucket with water and ice.

Step 2: Put two tablespoons of salt into the ice bath and mix it around.

Step 3: Place the bottle in the ice bath, wait two minutes and your wine is chilled!

What exactly is happening here, you ask? The salt is creating a chemical reaction that lowers the freezing point of the ice water, which helps the wine chill faster. Genius!

You can’t record video but you can snap pictures to share with your family or post on Petzi’s social site or #Catstagram.

Petcube Play

For those days when nothing but playing with your cat will make you feel better, and you’re stuck at an airport or in the office, there’s Petcube Play. Like Petzi, it’s an interactive Wi-Fi camera that lets you check in on your pets using an iOS or Android mobile app.

The HEXBUG Mouse Robotic Cat Toy is a fuzzy, pink-eared mouse with an on/off switch. When turned on, its tail wiggles back and forth as it scampers across the floor and, like a real mouse, stops and starts randomly as it’s being chased.

You can’t get more fun than this for under $10.

Plantronics BackBeat PRO 2

Technically, this is a human gift, but anything that provides more playtime outside for the dog is a great pet gift too.

Joshua Crawford Terry Horman

On Joshua Wayne Crawford’s 21st birthday, his mom Terry Horman just wanted to celebrate the occasion. She knew he was having a party with friends the night before, so she didn’t bother him. Once daylight hit on Josh’s birthday, though, Horman texted her son.

“But I didn’t hear from him,” Horman told Dateline. “Nothing. Nothing at all.”

Instead, she got every parent’s worst nightmare: the dreaded knock on the door from the police. “I knew at that time it was not good,” she said.

Fourteen years ago on July 2, 2003, Horman answered the door to hear the news of her son’s murder.

“They said he was found dead. I collapsed, and went into shock,” she told Dateline. “I don’t remember that much… only what my husband has told me.”

Friends reportedly found Crawford in his first-floor Frederick, Maryland apartment after he didn’t show up to work. Crawford didn’t open the door, so friends say they had to climb in through the window. His apartment had been ransacked, according to Horman, and video games, a guitar, jewelry and other personal items were gone. Furniture was allegedly flipped, and the room was in disarray.

Crawford, though, was in even worse shape. Friends say they found him badly beaten, with obvious blunt force trauma to his head, stab wounds to his chest. His wrists and ankles had been bound with duct tape.

Horman said Crawford’s friend Justin Nailor then called 911, reporting cardiac arrest.

“I never did understand that,” Horman told Dateline.

Authorities say Crawford was pronounced dead at the scene. An autopsy later ruled the cause of death to be asphyxiation and blunt force injuries.

The Frederick County Sheriff’s Office at the time categorized the death as “suspicious in nature because of the manner in which the body was found.""

Investigators said the crime is victim-specific. “No arrests, though, have ever been made,” Major Tim Clarke of the Frederick County Sheriff’s Office told Dateline. “At various times, though, we have brought people in for extensive questioning.”

Despite those efforts, no suspects have ever been identified. Major Clarkes insists, though, that “this is very much an ongoing investigation.”

Horman has difficulty believing that.

“I swear to God, I’m dealing with crooked cops. I believe they know who killed my son,” she said. “My main frustration is that they won’t tell me anything.”

“We understand where Ms. Horman is at,” Major Clarke told Dateline. “But the less information we put out to the public, the better it is for the detectives, because it helps protect the investigation.”

In 2010, the Frederick County Sheriff’s Office received a Maryland state grant that allowed them to reanalyze DNA evidence from the crime scene. With no arrests made, or suspects identified following those results, though, they failed to be significant.

“We are trying everything possible to solve this case and bring the appropriate people to justice,” Major Clarke said.

Court records show Crawford was familiar to local law enforcement, having been arrested in 2001 on charges of possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute.

“My son sold drugs—I’m not going to sit here in any type of denial,” Horman admits. “But he was only 21 years old. He was a baby. He had a lot of growing up to do.”

Terry Horman

Horman, of course, remembers Joshua as he was growing up. Crawford was a Boy Scout, and also played baseball throughout his childhood. “He used to hit the balls and make the home runs,” Horman says. When they needed a home run, they always said, ‘Let’s put Josh Crawford in there.’”

“We were very close – he was my sentimental son,” Horman told Dateline. “Once a week we would go to Dairy Queen, and every year on my birthday he would buy me a gift. [Now], my worst times of year are Mother’s Day, his birthday and Christmastime,” Horman said.

This year, Crawford would be 38 years old. Even 14 years after his murder, Horman still holds an annual vigil for her son.

“[The Sheriff’s Office] encourages and embraces the light that her vigils bring to the case,” Major Clarke told Dateline. “Because when that occurs, we get more information, and hopefully people learn more about the case and that brings forth new leads.”

“I can’t think of anyone who didn’t like him,” Horman added. “Why? Why would they be so mean and cruel to my son? Why? I just want justice for my son. Everyone deserves at least that.”

“No one likes to have an open homicide. No one,” Major Clarke said. “[Crawford’s case] is personal to a lot of people on our team. We speak of it every day.”

Trump has previously said that allowing Obamacare to crash and burn would bring Democrats to the table to negotiate with Republican on overhauling the health care system.

The president did not extend a hand to Democrats to work with the White House and Republicans on a health care compromise.

Three Republican senators — John McCain, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins — joined Democrats in voting against the repeal bill around 1:40 a.m Friday morning.

Trump's remarks Friday were centered around efforts to ""dismantle, decimate, and eradicate"" the MS-13 gang, known for its violence in Suffolk County, New York, as well as other areas. But his remarks veered off script to include asides on the benefits to the country in having rich secretaries of the Commerce and Treasury Departments, trade deficits and the size of the motorcycle brigades that flanked his motorcade during the 2016 campaign.

Trump's tough line on immigration earned him support during the presidential race, and he has sought to make undocumented immigrants who have committed violent crimes and violent gangs the face of his crusade for a wall and tighter security on the Southern border. That pitch often includes graphic description of crimes, with Friday being no exception as Trump talked about gruesome murders committed by gang members with clubs, machetes and knives.

""These are animals,"" he said. ""They have transformed peaceful parks and beautiful, quiet neighborhoods, into blood-stained killing fields.""

For that reason, Trump encouraged roughness from law enforcement in the battle against gangs and cartels.

""Like when you guys put somebody in the car and you’re protecting their head. You know? The way you put their hand over — like don’t hit their head and they just killed somebody, don’t hit their head. I said you can take the hand away, OK?""

Trump said the effort to curtail gangs is working.

""One by one we’re liberating our Americans towns — can you believe that I’m saying that we’re talking about liberating our towns it’s like a scene in a movie,"" the president said. ""They’re liberating the town, like in the old Wild West right? We’re liberating our towns. I never thought I’d be up here talking about liberating the towns on Long Island."""
http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/same-sex-domestic-violence-court-win-has-unintended-problem-n787496,nbcnews,Same-Sex Domestic Violence Court Win Has Unintended Problem,['Associated Press'],"COLUMBIA, S.C. — A South Carolina Supreme Court ruling meant to give unmarried same-sex partners the same domestic violence protections as heterosexuals appears to have an unintended consequence: Now authorities might not be able to charge any unmarried person with beating their partner.

Attorney General Alan Wilson has joined with a gay woman who successfully sued the state to ask the justices to re-write their Wednesday ruling. Otherwise, they'll have to rely on the conservative Legislature to change the code, a solution the woman's lawyer, Bakari Sellers, said might get stuck in partisan bickering over the morality of same-sex relationships.

South Carolina Supreme Court Associate Justice Costa M. Pleicones. MARY ANN CHASTAIN / ASSOCIATED PRESS

The problem: As the gay rights movement gained national momentum, state lawmakers changed the domestic violence law in 1994 by adding ""male"" and ""female"" to the South Carolina code, which initially didn't mention gender. A decade later, they didn't remove the words when they significantly overhauled the law and increased penalties for domestic abuse in 2015.

""What we don't want to do is embarrass the state of South Carolina and have it devolve down into partisan politics,"" Sellers said.

The court unanimously struck down wording that applied the domestic violence law to households where a ""male and female who are cohabiting or formerly have cohabited.""

Related: Judge Orders Kentucky to Pay for Same-Sex Marriage Lawsuit Fees

With that phrase entirely eliminated, prosecutors and law enforcement officials worry that domestic violence charges can only apply to married people or direct relatives.

Wilson and Sellers want the court to instead accept a remedy offered by one justice in a concurring opinion: Rather than strike down the phrase about cohabitation, judges could be told to apply the existing law to same-sex couples.

""Because of the immediate and pressing need to protect all victims from domestic violence, we are united in our request to the court and optimistic that we can maintain the protections afforded by the act, and extend them to all victims,"" Wilson's office said in a statement.

Wilson agreed that it's too risky to ask the Legislature to act when lawmakers might not convene until January.

The Supreme Court had no immediate response.

Sellers emphasized that no one wants the justices to change the impact of Wednesday's ruling.

""This is still a victory for progress,"" Sellers said. ""We just want to make sure things get clarified.""

Schecter', 'Lisa Riordan Seville']","State and federal law enforcement made a sweep of arrests last week in South Florida, targeting owners of drug treatment centers in the state's large — and troubled — rehab industry.

The crackdown comes in the wake of an increasing focus on corruption and abuse in the drug treatment industry from California to Florida. In June, an NBC News Investigation found that many addicts traveling to South Florida for recovery ended up in programs run by unscrupulous operators more interested in billing their insurance than helping them get better. This month, the operators of a treatment center that was featured in the NBC News Report were hit with more than 60 charges by state prosecutors.

There are many good drug rehab facilities in South Florida, which has long been a destination for patients seeking treatment for drug abuse. Thousands have found sobriety there. But state and federal authorities said that wider insurance coverage for addiction treatment combined with comparatively little regulation and oversight have laid the groundwork for corruption.

""There's no incentive in sobriety,"" said State Attorney Dave Aronberg, Palm Beach County's top prosecutor. ""The money is in relapse.""

Among those arrested on federal charges was a rehab and halfway house owner who charged more than $58 million to insurance, according to prosecutors. They say Eric Snyder offered free rent to lure addicts to his halfway houses, also known as ""sober homes,"" while milking their insurance at his treatment center.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions referred to Snyder's treatment center last week as a ""fake rehab"" that is alleged to have ""recruited addicts with gift cards, visits to strip clubs, and even drugs.""

Snyder's attorney, Bruce Zimet, denied the charges against his client, adding that while his client is under investigation, the case has not yet been presented to a grand jury to determine whether to indict or not.""He has literally saved the lives of many, many people who had gone through his facility in the past and were suffering from addiction issues,"" said Zimet. ""While there's a lot of abuse in the industry, Snyder is not one of those people who is an abuser.""

Snyder and a former employee were among more than 400 people arrested in 20 states on a bevy of medical fraud allegations. Snyder is accused of conspiring to commit healthcare fraud against private insurance companies, but most of the other federal charges involve allegations of misuse of federal healthcare programs for the elderly and the poor.

In South Florida, Palm Beach County's Sober Home Task Force, assigned to target fraud in the rehab industry, also brought charges against rehab owners for allegedly paying for addicts. The multi-agency effort headed by Aronberg has made more than 30 arrests, largely on charges of ""patient brokering,"" in the past year. ""Patient brokers"" find addicts with good insurance coverage and then ""sell"" them to specific programs.

'I Wish I Had No Insurance'

Alison Flory is one of thousands of young people who arrived in South Florida looking for help. Instead, she got pulled into the ""South Florida shuffle.""

Her insurance was billed more than $1 million in the 15 months she spent in Florida bouncing to nine treatment centers. Last October, Flory overdosed and died in a home linked to a treatment center run by a convicted felon named Kenneth Chatman.

""I was just thankful that I had good insurance — and in this particular case I wish I had no insurance,"" said her mother, Jennifer Flory. ""It led to her death.""

In May, Chatman was sentenced to 27 years in federal prison for conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud and sex trafficking. Six other people have pleaded guilty to charges in that case, including two doctors, a counselor, and two operators of ""sober homes"" like the one in which Flory died.

Flory also attended London Treatment Center, one of more than 200 treatment centers in Palm Beach County. The rehab billed her insurance more than $69,000 for the two and a half months she spent in the program.

Last March, two patients from the program overdosed in a nearby parking lot. The incident was described in a probable cause affidavit that linked London Treatment Center to a local sober home where there were six overdoses over the course of five months in 2016. One of them was fatal, according to the affidavit.

In May, state authorities charged the owner of that sober home with three counts of patient brokering for allegedly accepting kickbacks to send his tenants to London Treatment Center.

NBC News made several requests for an interview with operators of London Treatment Center in early 2016 but was told by a representative that medical privacy laws prohibited them from commenting. No one would speak to NBC News on a visit to the center in June.

“ The broad brush of bad actions and illegal activity is painting across everybody.”

This month, State Attorney Aronberg's office charged the owners of London Treatment Center with 62 counts of patient brokering. Court documents allege Mark Johnston and Jordi Martinez-Garcia paid sober home operators $500 to $600 a week for each patient sent to the rehab. Two of the sober home owners who spoke to police were allegedly paid more than $256,000 since early 2016 to refer patients to the center, court documents show.

""There are no allegations in the probable cause affidavit that the health and safety of any patient of London Treatment Center were violated at any time,"" Adam Frankel, the attorney for London's owners, told NBC News in a statement. He said that his clients have been treated unfairly and had previously cooperated with investigators voluntarily and ""look forward to the opportunity to present their side of the story in this matter.""

Related: How to Find a Good Drug Treatment Program

For those within the industry trying to do things right, stepped-up enforcement has been a double-edged sword, said John Lehman, CEO of Florida Association of Recovery Residences, an industry group for sober home operators. Many of the ethical operators were those who first alerted authorities about fraud and patient brokering. They also participated in passing legislation recently signed into law to create better oversight and regulation of sober homes and treatment center.

But because of the bad publicity, the stain on South Florida has also spread to those trying to do things right.

""The broad brush of bad actions and illegal activity is painting across everybody,"" said Lehman. ""There are so many good programs down here that have held on, and they feel they are being persecuted. They were the ones who sounded the alarm in the first place.""

Lehman said he hopes that the South Florida recovery community can weather this storm in part because the opioid epidemic has created a desperate need for places that foster long-term recovery.

""Just putting people into a treatment center and then giving them a gold coin, and sending them home, does not work,"" he added. ""You've got to support them to develop recovery legs. This is a great place to do that, if there's anybody left standing when this is all over."""

Hyundai Makes a Luxury Car that Gets Better Ratings than BMW or Porsche,['Paul A. Eisenstein'],"Genesis is turning out to be one of the best-kept secrets in the U.S. luxury car market. Industry data show that relatively few upscale buyers even know the spin-off from mainstream South Korean carmaker Hyundai even exists. But those who do seem positively ecstatic, with Genesis rising to the top in recent quality and customer satisfaction surveys, well ahead of more traditional luxury brands like Lexus, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz.

Paul A. Eisenstein

“We’re in a great position,” Erwin Raphael, general manager of Genesis, told NBC News.

The G80 line – which includes two other variants – is already outselling the comparably sized Audi A6 and giving chase to the BMW 5-Series and Mercedes E-Class models.

A New Reputation

Say the name, Hyundai, and you’re likely to think of a compact economy car. But in recent years, the brand has moved steadily up-market, nudging into the luxury segment with its original Genesis sedan in 2009. The midsize model quickly shook up the established order, taking honors as the North American Car of the Year. Hyundai soon followed with the even bigger and more lavishly equipped Equus model.

Related: Hyundai Launches the Genesis Brand

Initially, the Korean carmaker was content to offer the two high-line models under its own badge. But that tended to confuse customers – and turn off upscale buyers who didn’t want to see their cars share the same logo as a $15,000 Hyundai Accent. Two years ago, the Koreans decided it was time to spin off the Genesis brand.

To hold down initial investments, Hyundai decided not to require dealers to set up separate showrooms. The vast majority of Genesis retailers have simply carved out space in existing Hyundai showrooms. But that’s about to change. Genesis plans to ask new retailers to set up standalone Genesis showrooms.

That’s not a cheap proposition. It’s not unusual for luxury dealers to spend $5 million or more on a showroom these days. The question is whether it will be worth the return. When the first model to carry the winged Genesis badge debuted last year, barely 1 percent of American motorists knew what the brand was, according to industry research. That has since grown to around 4 percent - but top European models have brand awareness that runs into the mid-60 percent range.

That poses a serious challenge, said analyst Joe Phillippi, of AutoTrends Consulting, but one that is not insurmountable – especially considering the way Genesis has been scoring in recent owner surveys.

Rated Better Than a Porsche

Last month, Genesis was named second-highest brand in the closely watched J.D. Power Initial Quality Survey – behind only sibling Korean carmaker Kia. It leapfrogged perennial luxury leaders like Porsche and BMW, with Mercedes-Benz, Acura, Audi and Cadillac not even coming up to the industry average in the new IQS.

Weeks later, Genesis landed among the leaders in the Vehicle Satisfaction Awards, an annual survey of owners by consulting firm AutoPacific. And the flagship G90 sedan not only outranked competitors like the BMW 7-Series, Lexus LS, and Mercedes-Benz S-Class, but scored higher than any product ever in the VSA.

AutoPacific President George Peterson called the results “exceptional,” and rare for a new brand and a new product to “create a new benchmark for excellence.” Perhaps the only other example of that happening in recent decades came in the early 1990s with the launch of the Lexus brand which quickly shook up an established luxury order then dominated by German and American brands.

Related: How Does a Luxury Brand Differentiate Itself?

That could happen again, said Peterson, pointing to the Genesis strategy of offering a high value for the dollar, while emphasizing customer satisfaction in both its products and its approach to sales and service. For one thing, buyers get free pick-up and delivery when a vehicle needs service or repairs, along with a free loaner.

What About a Genesis SUV?

Can Genesis repeat the success of Lexus? Not everyone is confident that can happen – at least not unless parent Hyundai is willing to invest billions of dollars to take on its well-funded luxury competitors.

If the new Korean luxury brand has taken any criticism it’s for the decision to launch with just two sedan models. That would seem to run out of sync with current market trends. Utility vehicles now make up about 40 percent of the American marketplace, and they are gaining traction in China and Korea, the two other big Genesis markets, as well.

“I think we launched the way we should,” Raphael told NBCNews. “Sedans are where luxury brands make their name,” he said, pointing to vehicles like the Mercedes S-Class and BMW 7-Series.

That said, the initial Genesis five-year plan calls for the brand to offer three sedans, two SUVs and a sporty coupe. The brand revealed a prototype version of its first ute, dubbed the GV80 Concept, at the New York Auto Show this past April. A second, smaller SUV will follow soon afterwards.

And Genesis is already looking to expand on that five-year plan, with Raphael revealing Genesis will look to fill the “white space,” other niches that German brands have been especially good at targeting. Mercedes, BMW, and Audi have launched a product offensive previously unseen in the luxury market, and they have plans to add dozens more new models before the end of the decade.

It’s unlikely Genesis will even try to match the Germans, model-for-model. But it is betting that if it can fill high-volume segments with new products that win the same sort of kudos as the G80 and G90 have, it should be able to carve out a modest, but highly profitable, niche in the luxury market.

And, as happened with the Lexus, Genesis is already sending its more established competitors scrambling, trying to figure out how to respond."

On Sept. 11, 2001, nearly 3,000 people died when terrorists crashed planes into the World Trade Center in an elaborate plot. More than 15 years after 9/11, the threat remains in the nation's biggest city, but terrorists are now using simple tactics available to any small group or lone wolf — attacks with knives, guns and motor vehicles on urban crowds.

Three days after ISIS attackers killed 130 people in Paris in November 2015, the NYPD formally deployed the first officers of the Critical Response Command, a new unit intended to protect New York against terror. Waters heads the unit, which is now more than 500 officers strong and alert to threats both high-tech and low.

NBC News was granted unprecedented access to the CRC as officers trained for scenarios ripped from the headlines.

In their drills they focus on taking out terrorists armed with knives, guns, bombs and cars who are targeting civilians in the heart of the city — exactly what police officers have encountered in places as far-flung as Orlando, Mumbai, and Paris.

""In any police department,"" said New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill, ""you have to take a look at not just what's going on in the city, the nation — you have to take a look at what's going on worldwide.""

The CRC is trained to take the offensive, even if there are already wounded civilians on the ground. The ""number one goal,"" said Dawkins, is ""stop the threat. Have to. Have to. ... Because if I don't, then more innocents will be taken.""

New York City has been targeted by plots or attacks 23 times since 9/11. The NYPD has equipped more than 1,000 officers, including members of the CRC, with military-style weapons. As Officer Dawkins noted, the active shooters in places like Paris and Orlando had high-powered rifles.

Bitcoin isn’t like traditional currencies, and not just because it doesn’t exist as actual coins or paper banknotes.

Unlike traditional currencies like the dollar or euro, Bitcoin isn’t controlled by a single government or central bank. Instead, every transaction involving the popular cryptocurrency is logged in a computerized public ledger called a blockchain. This collection of receipts is maintained on millions of devices around the world in individual collections called blocks. Each time there’s a transaction involving Bitcoin, an anonymous data “fingerprint” appears in a block recording the exchange.

This key innovation is the basis for ""Block Bills,"" a collection of paper banknotes that bring the virtual payment system into the real world. As works of art, the whimsical bills have no monetary value. But they provide a “map” to the inner workings of the Bitcoin system—and they have a subtle beauty all their own.

“In some way, the project is a loose data visualization, but I mainly wanted to make the bills be interesting on their own as artworks,” says Matthias Dörfelt, the Los Angeles-based artist who made the notes.

Each of the 64 bills in the collection represents a single block in the blockchain ledgers. The colors vary according to the volume of transactions. A less colorful bill represents low volume, while a more color bill represents high volume.

In some way, the project is a loose data visualization, but I mainly wanted to make the bills be interesting on their own as artworks. In some way, the project is a loose data visualization, but I mainly wanted to make the bills be interesting on their own as artworks.

At the bottom of each bill is a white bar with symbols that represent the specific address of the Bitcoin. On the left is a series of dots that encode the history of all the transactions. The timestamp at the bottom-right corner of each bill indicates the moment when that block of transactions was created.

Lastly, the centers of the bills feature an indistinct image of a human being or imaginary creature. The idea here, Dörfelt says, was to create “something that reflects all the supposed privacy and anonymity connotations that Bitcoin has.""

You consciously do the grip and grin. But you may unconsciously perform the shake and sniff.

After pumping a person's hand during a greeting, some people take that moment of body-language reading to a deeper level, absentmindedly trying to detect traces of information from the scents left on their palms, new science suggests.

Israeli researchers watched as people used the first moments after a handshake to get a good whiff of the person they just met, lifting their right hands to their noses multiple times, according to the study published in the journal eLife.

After a handshake, “people had their hands at their noses 22 percent of the time,” said coauthor Noam Sobel, a professor and chair of the department of neurobiology at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel.

“That is crazy!"" Sobel added. ""You look at the videos of people and wonder: how did we not notice this before?”

Justin Sullivan / Getty Images These common greetings may leave a tell-tale scent, scientists say.

Sobel and colleagues first checked to see if a handshake could actually transfer the kinds of specialized chemicals that are known to spark a response in the nose. Experimenters with latex gloves shook hands with study volunteers and, sure enough, when the gloves were examined, they had easily detectible amounts of the chemicals.

In another experiment, 153 volunteers—unaware researchers had them on hidden camera—were greeted as they sat waiting for the study to begin. Half got a handshake, the rest did not. The researchers secretly filmed the volunteers before, during and after the greeting. After that hello shake, there was a lot of hand sniffing, or at least a lot of hands being raised to the nose.

To verify that people were actually smelling their hands, the researchers fitted another 33 volunteers with nasal catheters to measure breathing. To disguise the purpose of that experiment, the volunteers also were equipped with electrodes from an EEG device. The nasal catheters told the whole story: when a hand was close to the nose, airflow through the nostrils doubled.

The behavior is such an unconscious act that even when the researchers revealed the purpose of the study, many volunteers denied they were sniffing their hands.

“Everyone was blown away when we showed them their own videos,” Sobel said. “It was universal. Nobody was aware of this behavior.”

Sobel suspects that over time hand sniffing evolved as a surreptitious and socially acceptable way to evaluate others.

In the animal world, overt sniffing is a way of scoping out newbies. Humanity, on the other hand, has evolved to find ways to cover up our scents.

“The bottom line,” Sobel said, “is that like all mammals, we communicate using chemosignals. Other mammals—rats, mice, dogs and cats—very overtly sniff each other. That’s not acceptable with strangers in our culture. So we’ve evolved a mechanism to obtain the information in an acceptable way.”

The new research is “very creative and very, very interesting,” said Helen Fisher, a senior research fellow at the Kinsey Institute. “This article is really showing that a lot of olfactory signals are still being sent and people are, in spite of themselves, picking up on them and responding.”

Thus sniffing remained important since humans evolved: figuring out whether the person in front of you is friend or foe, Fisher said.

“You learn a lot from touching a hand,” she added. “Is it clammy? Maybe it’s not a real solid handshake. We instantly notice those things because we’re trying to size this person up. We feel someone is rude if they don’t stick out their hands and shake ours. Maybe that’s not just about social disinterest, but also that they are not allowing us to collect data on who they are and what their intensions are.”

While it’s not clear yet what kind of information people are extracting from smelling hands post-greeting, there’s no question we are constantly processing smells, said Pamela Dalton, an olfactory researcher at the Monell Chemical Senses Center.

Studies at Monell have shown that people can actually “smell” stress. Researchers there introduced volunteers to a cleaned up version of sweat that came from someone who was stressed. “It affected how they felt and how they made judgments about other people,” Dalton said. “It had no smell and they weren’t aware they were smelling anything.”

The victims turned to the “Find My iPhone” app, which led them straight to Reinaldo De Jesus Henao, a 36 year-old man with a backpack full of more than 100 stolen cellphones, Indio police said.

With social media such a large part of Coachella's culture — the fashion, food, music, and art are Snapchat and Instagram ready — it didn’t take long for several festival-goers to notice that their phones had disappeared.

""[We were] taking pictures then we went to post the photo,"" Laura Hunt Little told NBC affiliate KMIR. ""And my phone is gone.""

""People who lost their phones, or had them stolen, were tracking it,"" said Little. The group followed Henao throughout the festival venue until he was detained by security and eventually arrested by Indio Police.

Police searched Henao’s backpack and found the stolen cellphones. He was taken to the Larry D. Smith Correctional Center and booked on suspicion of grand theft and receiving stolen property. He was released after posting $10,000 bail, according to inmate records.

Judge Nicholas Francis made the order after a noon Thursday deadline for Charlie's parents and a hospital to agree an end-of-life care plan came and went. The judge said that meant the 11-month-old, who has a rare genetic disease, should now be transferred to a hospice and taken off life support.

Charlie’s parents, Connie Yates and Chris Gard, have been fighting with the hospital on his end of life arrangements. The parents and the hospital disagreed with how long Charlie would have in hospice before his breathing tube is removed.

The Thursday deadline was meant to yield a plan for what happened after Charlie was transferred to a hospice. Judge Francis earlier issued an order barring publication of the name of the hospice and the date when Charlie is taken there.

Great Ormond Street Hospital said on Tuesday that it had found a hospice willing to care for Charlie. However, it said that due to the invasive ventilation that Charlie needs, the hospice would be unable to provide care for more than a period of hours. Charlie's parents argued they had found a team of medical professionals willing to help Charlie at a hospice for up to a week.

""We deeply regret that profound and heartfelt differences between Charlie’s doctors and his parents have had to be played out in court over such a protracted period,"" a hospital spokesperson said in a statement. ""It has been a uniquely painful and distressing process for all concerned.""

""Charlie’s parents have tirelessly advocated for what they sincerely believed was right for their son, and nobody could fault them for doing so.""

On Wednesday, Charlie's parents gave up on their fight to bring their baby home to die after the hospital said that it wouldn't be in Charlie's best interests. The hospital has instead suggested that a hospice provide Charlie’s end of life care.

The internal combustion engine had a good run. It has helped propel cars — and thus humanity — forward for more than 100 years.

But a sea change is afoot that is forecast to kick gas-powered vehicles to the curb, replacing them with cars that run on batteries. A flurry of news this week underscores just how rapidly that change could happen.

A quick recap: On Monday, Tesla announced that the Model 3, its mass-market electric car, would start rolling off production lines this week with the first handful delivered to customers later this month. Then on Wednesday, Volvo announced that every car it produces will have a battery in it by 2019, putting it at the forefront of major car manufacturers. Then came France’s announcement on Thursday that it would ban the sale of gas-powered cars by 2040.

All this news dropped just in time for Bloomberg New Energy Finance's latest electric car report, which lays out why electric cars are the way of the future and when they’re projected to take over the market. The authors said although electric vehicles are currently a tiny fraction of the car market, that market could reach an inflection point sometime between 2025-2030. After that, electric car sales are slated to increase rapidly.

Related: Driving on Roads of the Future Will Be a Real Trip

Driven by the falling cost of batteries and the growing number of automakers producing a wider variety of electric cars, Bloomberg NEF expects that electric cars will account for 54 percent of all car sales globally by 2040. That’s a huge uptick from its forecast last year of electric vehicles accounting for 35 percent of all sales.

The shift to electric vehicles will disrupt the fossil fuel industry. The 530 million total electric cars forecast to be on the road by 2040 will require 8 million fewer barrels of oil a day to run.

A new forecast for electric cars shows explosive growth in new sales, particularly in China. Bloomberg NEF

One of the big pitches for electric cars is their positive benefit for the climate because they reduce the use of oil. But they will require a lot more power from the electric grid. Energy use from electric vehicles is expected to rise 300 times above current demand, putting more strain on power generation.

How that energy is produced will go a long way toward determining how climate-friendly electric cars actually are. A recent Climate Central analysis looked at all 50 states and found that the energy mix was clean enough in 37 of them to ensure electric cars are more climate friendly than their most fuel-efficient combustion engine counterparts.

Related: Why Flying Cars Still Haven't Gotten Off the Ground

That’s a sharp uptick from a 2013 analysis, which found that there were just 13 states where electric cars were cleaner than gas-powered ones, and it’s driven in large part by a precipitous drop in coal use.

While the U.S. is projected to be one of the biggest drivers of the electric vehicle revolution, China and the European Union will also be major players. By 2025, Bloomberg NEF’s projections show that China will be the biggest buyer of electric vehicles in the world, a trend that continues through 2040.

That means how China's energy mix develops will be one of the most important factors to determining how climate friendly all the new electric vehicles on the road will be.

He’d been through the wringer with a type of blood cancer called non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. First, he tried chemotherapy, and then, when the cancer came back a year and a half later, he underwent a bone marrow transplant.

But last year, when it came back again, he believed he was out of options.

“I was losing my battle against cancer,” Padilla, a 43-year-old sales representative, told NBC News.

Then he found out about an experimental therapy that’s a step beyond bone marrow transplants.

Called chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy — CAR-T for short — it involves taking a samples of T-immune cells called T-cells from a patient, genetically engineering them, and putting them back in to fight the cancer.

“Your body has many different soldiers within it that that could fight a ground war or a sea war or a land war,” said Dr. Frederick Locke, an oncologist at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida, who’s been testing the approach.

“We're taking all those soldiers out, giving each one of them a GPS and telling them … your target, what you're supposed to go attack, is actually the lymphoma,” he added.

“We're actually taking the cells out of the patient, redirecting them and putting them back in.”

Dimas Padilla, 43, of Kissimmee, is in remission from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after receiving an experimental cancer therapy called CAR-T. Here, he poses with his wife, Johanna Padilla. NBC News

It’s worked well in patients who had no other options after going through rounds of chemo and bone marrow transplants. More than one-third of patients who got the treatment — 39 percent — are tumor-free nine months later, researchers will tell a meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research that starts this weekend.

“These are patients who really are without hope,” Locke said.

“Patients who at best could expect to have a one in 10 chance of having a complete disappearance of their lymphoma,” he added. “So the results are really exciting and remarkable.”

More than 80 percent of the 101 patients who got the treatment were still alive six months later. “Only about half the patients who (went) on this study could expect to even be alive six months after the therapy,” Locke said.

Padilla is one of them. When the cancer came back most recently time, his lymph nodes were bulging. “They were so bad that they moved my vocal cords to the side and I was without my voice for almost three months,” he said.

“Once they infused … the cells in my body, within two to three days all my lymph nodes started melting like ice cubes.”

“They kept growing and my face was swelling, and I thought I was going to choke while I was sleeping.”

Padilla was among the last patients enrolled in the trial.

“Once they infused … the cells in my body, within two to three days all my lymph nodes started melting like ice cubes,” he said.

The treatment is no cake walk. Just as with a bone marrow transplant, the patient’s immune system must be damaged so that the newly engineered T-cells can do their work. That involves some harsh chemotherapy.

It’s so harsh that it killed three of the patients in the trial. Padilla says he still has some memory loss from his bout with the chemo.

“I had some fevers and I was shaking and a little bit of memory loss but it was temporary,” he said. “I will say that it was pretty intense for like a week, but in my second week, second week and a half, I was starting to feel more normal. I was able to start walking and the shaking was not as bad as it was in the beginning,” he said.

And when he got the news that his lymphoma was gone — at least for now — Padilla was delighted.

“I kissed my wife. I probably kissed the doctor,” he said.

The company developing the treatment, Kite Pharma, sought Food and Drug Administration approval for the therapy on Friday.

It carries the tongue-twisting name of axicabtagene ciloleucel, and it’s the first commercial CAR-T product to get into the FDA approval process.

It’s far too early to say any of the patients were cured, Locke cautions. And such a difficult treatment course is really only for patients in the most desperate condition.

“The patients in this trial were really without options,” he said.

But Locke is sold on the approach. “This is a revolution. It's a revolution in cancer care. This is the tip of the iceberg,” he said."
http://www.nbcnews.com/business/real-estate/selling-your-home-why-spring-strongest-seller-s-market-ever-n750571,nbcnews,Selling Your Home? Why This Spring Is the ‘Strongest Seller’s Market Ever’,['Diana Olick'],"Spring homebuyers are pounding the pavement at a furious pace, but the pickings are getting ever slimmer.

Even as more homes come on the market for this traditionally popular sales season, they're flying off fast, with bidding wars par for the course. Home prices have now surpassed their last peak, and at the entry level, where demand is highest, sellers are firmly in the driver's seat.

""I've been selling real estate for 25 years and this is the strongest seller's market I have ever seen in my entire real estate career,"" said David Fogg, a real estate agent with Keller Williams in Burbank, California. ""A lot of our sellers are optimistically pricing their homes in today's market, and I have to say in most cases we're getting the home sold anyway.""

Fogg listed a three-bedroom, two-bathroom, 1,240-square-foot home in Burbank for $789,000 and had three offers before the first open house Sunday. In the Los Angeles-area market, that is considered an entry-level home. The open house drew more than 100 potential buyers, most of them already weary of the competition.

""It's very tough. Most of the listings are intentionally listed a little low to get a lot of attention, and it's not uncommon to get 12 to 16 offers on one property,"" said Jilbert Mosessian, who has been renting in the neighborhood but wants to buy. ""In three properties recently, we did our best, we went considerably over the listing price, and we were told that there were still five people above us and they were only going to deal with them.""

More homes came on the market in March, but fierce demand made quick work of them. At the end of the month, the supply of homes for sale nationally was down 6.6 percent compared with a year ago, according to the National Association of Realtors. Unsold inventory is a slim 3.8-month supply. A balanced market between buyers and sellers has a five-to-six-month supply.

Properties sold in March were on the market for an average 34 days, down from 45 in February and 47 in March 2016.

In order to compete, buyers are coming in with cash and dropping contingencies. That is because in such a hot market, homes are appraising well below the sale price. That makes it even harder for first-time, mortgage-dependent buyers to succeed.

""I'm talking to the buyers in advance about these problems, so that we address the appraisal issues before we go to escrow and nobody is surprised in three weeks when we get an appraisal that's on the lower side,"" said Fogg.

As a result, home prices continue to hit new peaks each month. Prices nationally are up 5.7 percent in February year over year, according to Black Knight Financial Services. Washington, Oregon and Colorado are seeing the biggest price gains, as buyers flee high prices in California.

Real estate brokerage Redfin used its search engine to look specifically at which markets had the most people searching for homes outside their city. San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York took the top three spots. ""Fast-growing coastal cities may be generating the high-paying jobs, but they haven't created enough budget-friendly housing to keep pace,"" said Nela Richardson, Redfin's chief economist. ""The price of real estate and desire for homeownership is compelling many to uproot and seek housing in more affordable communities."""

http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/asia-s-youngest-nation-offers-glimmer-hope-lgbtq-rights-n784781,nbcnews,Asia’s Youngest Nation Offers Glimmer of Hope for LGBTQ Rights,[],"KUALA LUMPUR — Marching through the streets of East Timor's capital, Dili, with a rainbow flag in his hand, Natalino Guterres was overwhelmed with emotion, reminding him of how he felt 15 years ago when he saw the Timorese flag raised for the first time.

""It was an emotional moment,"" he said of the pride parade.

""The sense of euphoria ... I saw happiness written on people's faces and some teared up. It reminds me of Independence Day in 2002.""

Guterres was among some 500 people taking part in East Timor's first-ever pride parade. The atmosphere was carnival-like, with participants waving colorful rainbow flags, cheering and beating drums in the capital.

Campaigners say the parade last month was a milestone for the tiny, half-island nation - Asia's youngest democracy - and a beacon of hope for a region where lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights are under increasing attack.

LGBTQ rights in the nation of 1.2 million people have not been a major focus. International headlines about the country have been dominated by its 24-year resistance to occupation by neighboring Indonesia, which eventually led to East Timor's independence in 2002.

However activists say social stigma and discrimination are common for LGBTQ people.

Same-sex behavior is not criminalized under East Timor's laws but they also do not offer protection against discrimination.

Kicked Out of Home, Bullied at School

Guterres, a development consultant who runs a youth group that organized the parade, said many like him grew up feeling ""lonely"" and do not know where to turn when they suffer discrimination.

""If you talk to the (LGBTQ) community, people have been kicked out of home or feel uncomfortable about going to school because they are bullied. They live from house to house because they are not accepted at home.

""That is why visibility of the LGBT community is important. We want to empower people who are still struggling,"" the 27-year-old told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Dili.

Prime Minister Rui Maria de Araujo gave a boost to LGBTQ rights supporters when he recorded a video message ahead of the march urging Timorese to create an inclusive nation, and accept people with different sexual orientations and gender identities.

"" I accept & respect the differences between people. How about you?"" Supporting 1st #PrideTL March in #TimorLeste pic.twitter.com/i8igjeLqyy — U.S. Embassy Dili (@USEmbassyDili) June 29, 2017

The call was a ""welcome glint of leadership amidst officials elsewhere in the region who openly stoke anti-LGBT bigotry"", said Kyle Knight, a LGBTQ rights researcher with New York-based Human Rights Watch.

Although Taiwan's top court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage in May, paving the way for the island to become the first place in Asia to legalize gay unions, progress of LGBTQ rights elsewhere in the region has been slow.

In neighboring Indonesia, the LGBTQ community has faced a series of attacks since last year with senior officials saying there is ""no room"" for gay rights movement, while authorities detained 141 men in a gay club raid in May.

In the same month, two young Indonesian men were publicly flogged for gay sex in the ultra-conservative Aceh province which has Islamic laws.

In Malaysia, health authorities prompted a public uproar last month over a video contest on how to ""prevent"" homosexuality, and were forced to amend the competition.

But Knight said East Timor could still offer more to the LGBTQ community by enacting laws to outlaw discrimination based on sexual identity.

""Timor Leste's current legal environment presents a mix of silence, protection and gaps for LGBT people,"" Knight said, using another name for the Southeast Asian country.

Long Way to Equality

The parade -- which was supported by international groups including U.N. agencies and diplomats -- has nevertheless raised hopes among the LGBTQ community in East Timor, and provided an impetus for the public to debate the topic.

""LGBT issues have been swept under the carpet all this while, now it is time to talk about them,"" said Felix Maia, the spokesman of U.N. Women in East Timor, who was at the parade.

""It creates polarizing opinion but we can only start raising awareness when people start talking about it,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Guterres said there is a long way to go to achieve equality but he was optimistic, as he has seen how his family attitude has changed over the years.

His brother, who stopped talking to him for two years after Guterres came out to him as gay, showed up at the pride parade clad in a T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan ""You are not alone"" and appeared on stage with him.

""He hugged me on stage and told me he was very proud of me,"" he said. ""We were both in tears.""

The practice closely resembles solitary confinement, although the Bureau of Prisons, or BOP, says it doesn't recognize the term and denies its existence within the federal prison system ─ even as some employees and former top officials have described it that way, investigators from the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General said in a report released Wednesday.

The BOP has known for years that it has had a problem. It has reduced its reliance on what it calls ""restrictive housing,"" and in 2014 it implemented policies to improve the care of mentally inmates.

But because of a shortage in medical staff, that change actually had the opposite effect, with the number of inmates being treated for mental illness dropping by 30 percent, the investigators found.

And it remains difficult to determine exactly how many mentally ill inmates are doing time in single-cell confinement, because the BOP doesn't fully document who has mental illness or the number of inmates kept in those conditions, according to the report.

The BOP has provided widely varied accounts of the number of federal inmates with mental illness, from 3 percent to 40 percent, the investigators found.

By comparison, the National Association of Mental Illness estimates that, among the general public, about 18.5 percent of U.S. adults experiences mental illness in a given year.

The BOP referred requests for comment to its official response in the report itself. In that response, the agency agreed to change many of its policies on restrictive housing and the mentally ill, including limiting time in isolation, better documenting such cases and hiring more medical staff.

The inspector general's investigators estimated that as of June 2016, 9,749 inmates, or 7 percent of the total inmate population at the time, were housed in the BOP's three largest types of restrictive housing: ""special housing units"" in place at 111 prisons, ""special management units"" at two maximum-security prisons in Pennsylvania and the so-called ""Supermax"" prison in Florence, Colorado.

They focused, in particular, on the Pennsylvania prisons, Lewisburg and Allenwood, and found that mentally ill inmates averaged about 29 months consecutively, mostly for non-disciplinary reasons, including their own protection. About 13 percent of those inmates were then ""released by the BOP directly into the community,"" according to the report.

The investigators interviewed officials in eight state corrections departments and found that three states limited restricted housing stays to 30 days, while three others had stopped placing seriously mentally ill inmates in restrictive housing at all."
http://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/mccain-flies-back-senate-it-too-soon-after-surgery-n786371,nbcnews,McCain Flies Back to Senate. Is It Too Soon After Surgery?,"['Jane Weaver', 'Shamard Charles']","Sen. John McCain returned to the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, 10 days after recovering from surgery to remove a malignant brain tumor. The Republican senator from Arizona is back in Washington to work on health care reform after undergoing minimally invasive surgery for an aggressive glioblastoma, a quick return after spending the past week outdoors and hiking with his daughter Meghan and friends.

McCain was in the Senate on Tuesday afternoon, in time for a critical vote on health care. But is the 80-year-old senator risking his health by getting on a plane or returning to work too soon?

""It is possible to fly cross country safely, but it needs to be done carefully,"" said NBC News medical correspondent Dr. John Torres. ""Having a trained flight crew and medical team that fully understands how flying can stress the body and worsen the medical condition is key.""

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Joe Harper sit on a rock at Zebra Falls in Oak Creek, Arizona in a photo shared on Twitter on July 23, 2017. John McCain / via Twitter

McCain is still in the ""honeymoon"" phase of his medical care, meaning he’s in the pre-chemotherapy and pre-radiation stages of care when fatigue and side effects are more likely to happen. But he is at higher risk of developing a deep vein thrombosis during the flight, according to Dr. Steven Kalkanis, chairman of the department of neurosurgery at the Henry Ford Health System, one of the most respected cancer centers in the U.S.

Cancer, which often causes a person's blood to clot more easily, places patients at high risk for developing clots in the legs where blood flow is more stagnant. If the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolus or the blocking of air and blood flow in the lungs, the results could be deadly. ""Cramped quarters, lack of movement, dehydration, and the hypercoagulability of brain tumor patients definitely increases the risks of these complications occurring, but they can be mitigated by moving about the cabin and staying hydrated,” said Dr. Lynne Taylor, neuro-oncologist and co-director of the Alvord Brain Tumor Center at University of Washington.

""Still, the risk of DVT in brain tumor patients is high and the risk does not end when the flight ends.""

Doctors are likely monitoring McCain closely and following standard protocol, which often includes placing cancer patients on a blood thinner.

McCain, who was treated by doctors at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, had a malignant tumor associated with a blood clot removed from behind his left eye. The Mayo Clinic could not be reached by NBC News for comment.

""Complications such as air in the brain or swelling of the brain are nearly zero 7-10 days after surgery. It would take a very compelling argument for me to disallow Senator McCain on that plane if he were my patient. Sen. McCain is a well-documented fighter and adhering to goals is part of the therapeutic process,"" Kalkanis told NBC News.

Following the surgery earlier this month, McCain recuperated at his home in Arizona. It has not yet been disclosed when the senator will begin treatment, which will likely include a combination of chemotherapy drugs to attack the malignant cells and radiation.

His colleagues say it's not surprising McCain would hurry back to the Senate.

""Is it surprising that he would get out of a hospital bed and go to work? No,"" said, McCain’s friend and colleague, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-SC, on Tuesday. ""It's surprising he's been in the hospital this long.""

Obdulia Sánchez, 18, was booked into the Merced County Jail on suspicion of DUI and gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated after Friday's crash, according to the California Highway Patrol.

Sánchez was behind the wheel of a 2003 Buick when the vehicle veered onto the right shoulder of the road, according to the California Highway Patrol. Police said it is unclear how fast Sánchez was driving.

She over-corrected, causing the vehicle to swerve across lanes, crash through a wire fence and overturn into a field, the authorities said.

The two 14-year-olds were not wearing seat belts and were ejected from the car during the crash, officials said.

In a statement, the California Highway Patrol said it is aware of the possibility of ""video evidence located on social media"" and is investigating.

Part of the livestream shows Sánchez outside the car with what appears to be her sister Jacqueline’s body. The other teen can be seen attempting to wave down help.

“I f-----g killed my sister, OK? I know I’m going to jail for life,” Sánchez says in the video. “This is the last thing I wanted to happen, OK? I don’t f-----g care though, I’m going to hold it down. Rest in peace, sweetie. If you don’t survive, I am so f-----g sorry.”

Sergio Ramos Estrada, a cousin, told NBC News the teens were preparing for a Quinceañera — a special 15th-birthday celebration — when the accident happened.

“We were going to go to her house the next day to celebrate her Quinceañera and unfortunately that happened,” Ramos Estrada said. The CHP is examining the video as part of the investigation.

Sánchez is currently being held on a $300,000 bond at the John Latoracca Correctional Facility in Merced.

Mary Hernandez, 25, was following Sánchez on Instagram and watched as the livestream showed the car careen into the fence.

Disturbed by what she saw, Hernandez said she recorded a copy of the video.

“There are so many people that are on my Snapchat that I see driving on their phone,” Hernandez told NBC News over the phone. “I hope that this video makes people think twice about what they’re doing in their car.”

Hernandez, a medical assistant from Stockton, California, said she doesn’t personally know Sánchez, but the women have mutual friends.

“This is real,” she said. “This is something that could seriously happen to someone.""

In an email to NBC News, an Instagram spokesperson said the platform is working to improve its live video feature.

“We're deeply saddened by this tragedy,"" the statement says. ""We urge people to use our reporting tools if they see any content or behavior that puts anyone's safety at risk. We want to interrupt these streams as quickly as possible when they're reported to us, and we will also notify law enforcement if we see a threat that requires an immediate response. We suggest people contact emergency services if they become aware of a situation where the authorities can help.”

The spokesperson declined to specify how long the video was accessible on the site.

Social media sites such as Instagram and Facebook have faced a host of violent or disturbing postings since users were given the ability to livestream.

In April, Steve Stephens shot and killed grandfather Robert Godwin Sr. while broadcasting the moment on Facebook Live. He had also broadcasted his intent to commit the crime on Facebook moments before. Stephens later killed himself following a police chase.

After questions about the livestreams circulated, Facebook's Vice President of Global Operations, Justin Osofsky wrote in a blogpost that the platform, which owns Instagram, was reviewing its reporting system for videos that violate its standards.

""We disabled the suspect’s account within 23 minutes of receiving the first report about the murder video, and two hours after receiving a report of any kind. But we know we need to do better,"" Osofsky wrote.

A 15-year-old Chicago girl was allegedly gang raped during a Facebook Live broadcast in March, and the stream was watched by at least 40 people, according to police.

In January, four Chicago teens were accused of beating and torturing a bound and gagged man with mental health challenges while streaming on Facebook Live.

After the four suspects had been arrested on unrelated battery charges, investigators were able to connect the two incidents through the Facebook Live video.

Also in January, 14-year-old Naika Venant spent nearly three hours broadcasting herself on Facebook Live in the bathroom of her foster parent’s home before she killed herself."

What Lies Ahead for Amazon?,['Ariana Brockington'],"Although Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos was only the world's richest person for the short span of a day before being unseated by Bill Gates, there's no indication so far that his company is losing its dominance in the world of internet retailers.

Bezos, 53, is now estimated by Bloomberg to be worth just over $89 billion. When markets opened on Thursday, his worth was measured at $90.6 billion, or about $500 million more than Gates'. He lost the world's richest person spot after Amazon’s second quarter results revealed profits were less than a third of Wall Street predictions, according to The New York Times.

Since 2012, the conglomerate — which Bezos started in a Seattle garage in 1995 — has conquered multiple markets, growing the founder's fortune by about $50 billion. He also founded Blue Origin, a space travel company that recently landed a rocket, and owns The Washington Post.

His brief new title followed Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods in June for $13.7 billion. In May, CNBC reported the company was considering venturing into the pharmaceutical business next.

John Lovallo of the public affairs firm LEVICK attributes the company’s success to its customer-centric business model.

“Their ability to connect with consumers and continue to connect with consumers is the real innovation here,” he said.

Brad Stone, journalist and author of ""The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon,"" points out that the creation of Amazon Prime and Amazon Web Services, Inc. helped further that customer connection. Amazon Web Services popularized the cloud service people can use on multiple devices and now makes up nearly 10 percent of Amazon’s revenues, according to Stone.

He added that Amazon Prime — which gives members expedited shipping and access to movies, TV shows, music and books — has allowed the company to expand its sales from toys and books to other items like clothes.

“It turned people into Amazon addicts that increased their spending on the site and it was an idea that worked,” he said.

But, Amazon's customer-centric business model has led to accusations of punishing work environments and the mistreatment of employees.

The New York Times spoke with current and former workers for a 2015 article detailing the pressure employees faced to constantly improve and meet expectations. Some employees said that when they suffered from miscarriages, cancer and other personal issues, they were wrongly judged and not given the necessary time to recover, according to The Times. Another said she never returned to the company after being labeled ""a problem"" by her boss for taking care of her father, who was diagnosed with cancer.

In 2012, Mother Jones published a personal essay about warehouse pickers who prepare shipments for online retailers including Amazon. The writer explains how she had to constantly wait in line to use one of only two bathrooms available for thousands of employees each day. She also had to stand in another queue to pass between metal detectors that ensured workers were not stealing merchandise. Warehouse staff sued Amazon for the time spent waiting in the security check lines but the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the company.

Despite the criticism and Thursday's missed expectations report, Lovallo does not think it's all likely to effect Amazon’s reputation. In addition to the company’s knowledge of data management and logistics, which Lovallo said is way ahead that of other companies, he noted the strength of Amazon's reputation among its customers for consistency, quality and relevancy.

“What is truly different about Amazon is that they’re not standing still. They continue to invest significantly in their infrastructure, platform, technology and categories,” Lovallo said. “To me, that is foundation of a quality company: they’re investing in the future even though they are the leader today.”

While Stone believes the small dip in Amazon's stock doesn't deflect from the company’s strong revenue, he added that the brand and its success isn’t untouchable.

In particular, he pointed to the recent Whole Foods purchase, which was lauded as disrupting an area grocers have mastered for years. Stone questions if Amazon’s customers will even want to buy groceries online — a virtual experience in which quality can't immediately be verified.

However, “Amazon is a learning company,"" he added. ""They tend to get very good at things that they should know nothing about. So it’ll be hard to count them out.”

Stone also predicts the company will face specific challenges.

He explained that as Amazon grows, it increasingly appears unsympathetic to endangering small retailers and local stores.

Stone also referred to President Donald Trump’s recent tweets regarding Bezos’ ownership of The Washington Post. He said the president's heightened mistrust of Amazon could be similar to allegations against Microsoft in the ‘90s, which would be dangerous for the company. In that case, which originally began in 1998, a judge ruled in favor of the Department of Justice that Microsoft was developing a monopoly in the web browser market and intimidating its competitors, The Times reported.

Still, Stone said, the company has a lot of room to grow by operating in different countries.

“I continue to find it one of the most interesting and beguiling companies out there,"" Stone said. ""Their combination of secrecy, ambition, inventiveness, the complexity of the business and the fact that they have so much more runway.”"

Opening the lower house for its second regular session, Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez said he would file a bill to legally recognize civil partnerships between people of the same sex. The Philippines would become the first Southeast Asian nation to legalize same-sex unions if he succeeds.

Alvarez said citizens should be allowed to divorce legally as much as same-sex couples should be allowed to have legally recognized unions.

""We must also be considerate of the fact that marriage may not be for everyone,"" he said.

""Presently, it even excludes certain groups of people from its fold. Our citizens should not be excluded from society just because of the person they love. They must also be treated with equality before the law,"" he said.

Twenty-seven countries, mostly in Western Europe and the Americas, have already recognized same-sex unions. A court in Taiwan issued a ruling in May that said same-sex couples had the right to marry legally.

The Vatican and the Philippines are the only states in which divorce is outlawed.

The proposals by Alvarez drew mixed reactions from lawmakers, both allies and the opposition.

The Philippine bishops would most likely try to block moves to legalize divorce and same-sex marriages, although Catholic Church representatives were not immediately available for comment.

Congressman Teodoro Baguilat described the proposal as ""bold, clear and progressive"", but representative Tom Villarina said Congress should focus on passing an anti-discrimination bill put forward by the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community because that proposal already had broad support.

In the most recent opinion polls, Filipinos overwhelmingly rejected same-sex marriages, with the latest survey in 2015 showing nearly 70 percent of 1,200 respondents strongly disagreed. Laws on same-sex marriages have been proposed as far back 2006, but none has gained traction.

However, the latest attempt could gain momentum because it has the endorsement of Alvarez, a close ally of Duterte, who enjoys a super-majority in the legislature.

Alvarez said divorce would strengthen the rights of minors, because there would be fewer illegitimate children under the law. Divorces, he said, would be a far less tedious and expensive process than annulling marriages, which can take years and face many legal hurdles.

""They (would) no longer have to sling mud at each other in front of a judge just to convince the magistrate that their marriage should be declared void,"" he said.

It's a phrase Emily Dull Anderson's family and friends have been repeating over and over again for three weeks now, ever since the Illinois 25-year-old disappeared.

""We just don't understand how someone and a car can just disappear into thin air,"" Cait Dull, one of Emily's two older sisters, told Dateline. ""Everyone who knows our family knows this isn't typical. Emily wouldn't just leave.""

The last time Emily was seen was in the early hours of Monday, June 19 after getting off work from Shooters North in Love Park, Illinois. The bartender had picked up an extra shift, as her father was also working that Sunday. It was Father's Day, and the rest of the family had just left for a vacation in Florida.

""They both couldn't get work off. And since our Dad was working, Emily didn't want to sit at home alone,"" her sister Cait told Dateline.

When Emily got off from her shift, she headed to several other bars to meet up with friends. Security videos captured her at each of her stops, the last being at Steak 'n Shake, a burger joint. It’s unclear who, if anyone, Emily was with at that last stop. The other two places Emily went that night had cameras inside, showing her chatting with friends. She can be seen leaving alone from the last bar she was at, but there aren't any cameras at Steak 'n Shake.

""You can see the people she was with left in the other direction. And because there aren't cameras at Steak 'n Shake, we don't know who she was with,"" Cait said. ""She spent money there, so we know she had been there. But did she run into someone there? We just don't know.""

What is known, is Emily never returned home to the house she shares with her father. She and her father are extremely close. Emily, Cait and their other sister's mother died when they were young, and it was their father who raised them.

""Now we help take care of him in a sense,"" Cait said. ""So for her to just not get in contact with him or not reach out — it's not something she would do to him.""

Emily's father reported her missing later that night, and Cait and other family members flew home early from their vacation to start searching.

The Love Park Police Department is investigating. Sgt. Michael Landman told Dateline that the case is active and all leads continue to be followed up on, as they have been from the start.

“We are using every tool available. It’s obviously frustrating for the family, because there aren’t any answers,” Sgt. Landman said. “If people do have information, we’re available 24/7 to take it. And people being as descriptive as possible is important when giving that information.”

While the official investigation ticks on, Cait and her family, frustrated by how police initially handled the case, have launched their own in a sense.

They've checked Emily's financial records, and say there hasn't been any activity since the night she disappeared. There were also several hundred dollars left in her room, Cait said. They got into several of her social media profiles. Again, noactivity since that night.

And one thing is especially troubling.

Emily is epileptic and takes two different medications three times a day, Cait says.

""She has to take her medication or she starts to get really sick and can't function,"" Cait told Dateline. ""And her prescription would have run out today. And she hasn't called to refill it. So she is out of medication now, if she even had it with her. It's a dangerous situation.""

Rumors have begun circulating about another possible dangerous situation in connection with the case.

""Several people have told us that she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong people,"" Cait told Dateline. ""We were told that she was given over for sex trafficking.""

Cait and her family are simply hoping someone, somewhere, will come forward with the information they need to find Emily safe. More than $16,000 has been raised to offer as a reward for information leading to Emily's safe return.

Of that reward, $5,000 was donated by the owner of a local car dealership who is the father of eight daughters. He told Cait and her family that he could never imagine one of his girls never coming home.

""The support from the community has been amazing,"" Cait said. ""But we're just devastated. That's the only way to really describe it.""

Cait is acting as the family's spokesperson. The situation is difficult to discuss, she says, but necessary.

""I can't be there to take her away from where she is maybe being held, but I can do this,"" Cait told Dateline. ""I need to be sure I’m making use of every day by doing something to find her. And I won't stop until she's home.""

Emily Dull Anderson is described as 5'5"" tall, weighing 130 lbs. with dark brown hair and green eyes. She has a tattoo of a phoenix on one arm and another tattoo on her chest. Her 2002 silver Pontiac Grand AM vehicle has the Illinois license plate V414149.

Anyone with information regarding Emily's case is urged to call the Love Park Police Department at (815) 654-5015."

Trump floated the idea during a meeting with congressional leaders at the White House, a congressional source said on condition of anonymity. According to the source, Trump said he'd like Congress to discuss the idea — but only if lawmakers give him the credit for it.

The president's suggestion was first reported by the political news website Axios, an NBC News media partner.

According to Axios, ""Trump told the lawmakers they could talk about the solar-paneled wall as long as they said it was his idea.""

A Nevada company has already submitted a formal proposal to build a U.S.-Mexican border wall covered with solar panels to generate electricity to pay for the project. AP

In March, the Trump administration published two requests for proposals to build as much as 1,900 miles of wall along the U.S.-Mexican border, specifying that it should be ""physically imposing"" — at least 30 feet tall and extending at least 6 feet below ground, with no nooks, crannies or other potential handholds for climbers.

A solar wall isn't a new idea. Homero Aridjis, an environmental artist, and James Ramey, a professor at Metropolitan Autonomous University-Cuajimalpa in Mexico City, proposed the idea in December.

""Mexico and the U.S. would be connected by a truly beautiful wall — a symbol of unity, visible even from space,"" they wrote.

Related: Donald Trump's Border Wall: A Progress Report

Thomas Gleason of North Las Vegas, Nevada, is also a fan of a solar wall — so much so that his company, Gleason Partners LLC, submitted a formal proposal to build it.

""We proposed a wall that pays for itself, and it looks pretty darned nice,"" Gleason told NBC affiliate KSNV of Las Vegas when he turned in the proposal in April. He said the project could pay for itself in about five years.

There's no real way to verify that projection, because no final design has been picked and because electricity prices vary significantly depending on region and conditions.

For example, the federal Energy Information Administration reported that in the southwestern United States, where the wall would be built, average wholesale prices for electricity ranged as low as $30 to as high as $50 per megawatt-hour in March, the last month for which full figures were available.

And there's no consensus on how much it would cost to build the wall in the first place. A report by the Department of Homeland Security in February put the cost at about $21.6 billion over three years.

But Senate Democrats threw scorn on that estimate. In April, they released a report estimating that a wall as envisioned by Trump would cost about $70 billion just to build — and $150 million a year more to maintain."

Remember good old breakfast, lunch and dinner?

Americans have pretty much thrown that out the window, the American Heart Association says. And that may affect how much weight we are putting on.

In fact, it might be a good idea to plan when to eat as much as what to eat, the group says in a new scientific statement. The association appointed a committee of experts to review the evidence from dozens of reports for one big study.

“This study clearly demonstrated that adults in the United States eat around the clock,” the American Heart Association says in the statement, published in the journal Circulation.

It’s still not 100 percent clear if it’s better to eat breakfast every day, or to eat less after 6 p.m. But a growing body of evidence does suggest that breakfast is good for you and that eating late at night can help you put on more pounds, even if you skipped meals earlier in the day.

Shutterstock New research shows Americans are eating around the clock, but need a little better planning to make that work for their hearts.

“Meal timing may affect health due to its impact on the body’s internal clock,” said Marie-Pierre St-Onge, an associate professor of nutritional medicine at Columbia University who helped write the statement.

Animal studies show that eating right before sleep might alter metabolism not only to promote weight gain, but in harmful ways that could help lead of diabetes and heart disease.

“However, more research would need to be done in humans before that can be stated as a fact,” she said.

And more people are eating late because more people are eating at all hours, the Heart Association team found. Between 1971 and 2010, the percentage of men who eat three squares a day fell from 73 percent of men in the 1970s to 59 percent in 2010. While 75 percent of women said they ate three meals a day in the 70s, by 2010 just 63 percent did.

RELATED: Timing meals may help you drop weight

Skipping breakfast may or may not cause people to put on weight — studies have mixed results — but people who do not eat breakfast are far less likely to get enough vitamins and mineral, the Heart Association team found.

And one consistent finding – the occasional short fast may be downright good for you. Several studies have found that people who fast as often as every other day or as little as one day a week can lose more weight than people who do not.

Beyond that, there is little consistent evidence on whether it’s best to eat at any given time, although smaller, more frequent meals may be both more fashionable and perfectly good for health, the Heart Association said.

“The impact of meal timing, particularly related to the evening meal, deserves further study,” the report reads.

So until there’s more firm guidance, what should people do? Slow down, plan and enjoy eating, the group recommends.

“We suggest eating mindfully, by paying attention to planning both what you eat and when you eat meals and snacks, to combat emotional eating,” St-Onge said.

“Many people find that emotions can trigger eating episodes when they are not hungry, which often leads to eating too many calories from foods that have low nutritional value.”"

You’re 30,000 feet in the sky, rubbing elbows with complete strangers, a baby fussing three rows ahead and the tops of clouds looking back at you from the nearest window. Nothing could feel less natural than this. Your eyes dart to nearby passengers to see how they’re reacting to what feels like a cruel social experiment on being confined in a tiny, jiggling box at a ridiculously high altitude.

One person, face lit up blue from their smartphone, is laughing at whatever is streaming, another is pensively flipping pages through her half-devoured novel, and the flight attendant is smiling calmly while taking drink orders. Those around you seem at ease, so why does it take every ounce of willpower you have not to freak as your knuckles go numb from the death grip you have on the arm rest?

What Fuels Our Fear of Flying?

According to the National Institute of Mental Health, about 6.5 percent of the U.S. population has aviophobia (a fear of flying), and roughly 25 percent experience some sort of flying-related anxiety.

“Some of the primary reasons some people are afraid to fly are a fear of crashing, a fear of being out of control, a fear of the unknown, a fear of heights, having lost a loved one in a plane crash and feeling claustrophobic,” says Ora Nadrich, a certified mindfulness meditation instructor and life coach. “Also, some people experience an overall sense of discomfort with the entire flying experience: airport procedures, crowds, turbulence, unappetizing food, cramped space and long flights.”

Anxiety is fueled by irrational, worst case scenario thoughts, and confined spaces are breeding grounds for this process. Anxiety is fueled by irrational, worst case scenario thoughts, and confined spaces are breeding grounds for this process.

Unsettling news reports — such as United Airlines personnel violently dragging a passenger off a flight, or American Airlines losing the ashes of a passenger’s daughter — can exacerbate flying fears, as well.

“Anxiety is fueled by irrational, worst case scenario thoughts, and confined spaces are opportunities for anxious thoughts,” explained Dr. Kevin Gilliland, a licensed clinical psychologist and author of Struggle Well, Live Well. He added, “Our anxious thoughts can be so powerful that they even activate our physical systems. That means our breathing becomes shallow, our chest gets tight, our palms get sweaty, we feel nauseated and maybe even lightheaded.”

How to Overcome Your Anxiety

In short: you’re not alone in your fear, and the anxiety you experience leading up to, and while aboard, your flight is very real (even if ultimately unfounded). There are ways to squash those fears, though, and it starts with a deliberate mental shift.

Know the Facts

You’ve probably read through safety statistics, or have at least been told that driving is more dangerous than flying. This is a good start, but the more you educate yourself on these facts, the less your anxiety will be able to creep in. According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), there’s a one in 11-million chance of being involved in an airplane accident, and even then, 96 percent of passengers survive airline accidents. Additionally, airplanes undergo extensive safety testing, ranging from wing flexibility to exposure to extreme temperature and beyond. You are truly safer in an airplane than you are in your own home.

In addition to reading up on safety statistics, educate yourself on the physics of flying and how planes work, in general. Gilliland says, “Understanding the basics of flying — like the phases of a trip and the sounds that planes make, can help. Without knowledge, anxiety leads us to make up really bad stories.”

Release and Replace Your Thoughts

In addition to educating yourself, you must also work to combat all of those “worst case” thoughts. If you tell yourself the same thing over and over again, you may eventually believe it, which breeds anxiety. To stop the cycle, Nadrich recommended using a technique she calls, “release and replace.”

“You take a thought like, ‘I’m afraid to fly because I think the plane will crash,’ and replace it with something like, ‘I am aware that flying frightens me, but I believe I will be fine and the plane will not crash.’ By doing this exercise repeatedly, you will feel less anxiety because your positive thought will override your negative thought,” she says.

Other positive affirmations could be, “I am safe;” “I am fine;” and “I am in good hands.” Anytime you begin to feel afraid, repeat those phrases over and over again in your mind.

Distract Yourself

Even if your flight is only an hour long, that’s a good chunk of time to sit, stew and work yourself up into a panic. Prior to departing, create a feasible checklist of things you want to accomplish while up in the air, and then work diligently to check those items off. Maybe you want to read a chapter of your book, brainstorm birthday gift ideas, write those thank-you notes you’ve been putting off, work on a business project or organize images on your phone or computer.

Another way to distract yourself is to use a tool Nadrich calls a “visualization.”

“Imagine yourself somewhere that is picturesque and beautiful, either a place or country you have been to that you loved, or somewhere you would like to go. By seeing yourself somewhere that calms, soothes or pleases you – and allowing yourself to be fully there — it will begin to relax you and reduce anxiety in your body,” explained Nadrich.

Visualization is a powerful tool to have in your back pocket: Research conducted by Dr. Elisha Goldstein showed that those who spent five minutes a day practicing a guided meditation exercise similar to the one above reported significantly reduced stress levels and enhanced feelings of well-being. You might even consider downloading a meditation app with guided imagery tracks on your phone to turn on during especially tense times like takeoff and turbulence.

Focus on Your Breathing

If you’re up in the air and you begin to feel panicked, redirect your thoughts to your breathing. “Anxiety often leads us to breathe shallowly and rapidly,” says Gilliland. “Slow, big breaths can help us relax the body, and the mind usually follows.”

Nadrich recommended breathing in through your nose for two counts, holding for two counts, gently exhaling for four counts, and then holding for one count. Repeat five to 10 times. Deliberate breathing puts you in control of your body and your mind, allowing you to be the observer instead of the reactor.

According to The American Institute of Stress, ""deep breathing increases the supply of oxygen to your brain and stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, which promotes a state of calmness."" Focusing on your breath also shifts your focus from your mind to your body, which can help quiet racing thoughts.

Giving yourself more control over the entire flying experience requires practice and deliberate effort. But if you follow this advice, you’re on your way to calmer skies."

Worrying about those tiny details is a time-consuming process in Hollywood and one that has remained surprisingly old school, using yellow pads and big binders to keep track of a shoot. That is, until now.

ProductionPro, which was recently used on the second season of Netflix's ""The Crown,"" along with Broadway shows including ""Kinky Boots"" and ""Miss Saigon,"" is an app that rolls up all of those old school processes into a simple iPad app.

A crew member uses ProductionPro on set ProductionPro

""It’s really the simplicity I think people reacted to,"" Alex Libby, founder of ProductionPro, told NBC News. ""They’re really able to automatically organize all of their ideas, the research, the designs and the continuity from each scene into the structure of the story seamlessly and that is the first time it's ever happened for them.""

Virtually everything we need to lead our high-tech lives exists inside the smartphones we carry around in our pockets, from the way we work — via productivity apps such as Todoist and Evernote — to the way we get to work — with Uber, Lyft, and Waze; and even the way we work out.

Yet somehow the app revolution, which was largely spurred with the creation of Apple's App Store in 2008, never really disrupted Hollywood.

“The entertainment industry as a whole has been underserved by tech since the Greeks,"" Libby told NBC News. ""They are extremely analogue, and a group of journeyman and apprentices who learn from their forefathers,"" said Libby, who has worked as a crew member on Broadway and Hollywood sets.

""People would go back to their binders they’d have to carry from location to location,"" he added. ""And now it is one iPad.”

ProductionPro's visual scroll allows users to organize research, designs, and continuity within the structure of the film. ProductionPro

While working on the film ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close,"" Libby said he became inspired to create a solution. At first, he used a six-foot-wide, 150-foot long scroll to organize the scenes and all of the elements, including props and costumes.

While it helped, he said he was inspired to create something less unwieldy, and so he worked with a team of techies to help bring his idea for an app to fruition. Freelancers can get accounts for $20 per month, while accounts for an entire set start at $2,500.

It's still early days for ProductionPro, but with a few successful big budget shoots under their belt, Libby said more people in the entertainment industry are becoming receptive to embracing technology. He said there are some ""majorly huge"" clients lined up that he can't yet disclose.

""You often find people on the ground can’t actually imagine what tech can do. That has been one of our great joys, going in showing people that with a touch of a button, you can save hours of your day,"" he said. ""And you can use that brain space to create instead of [worry about] the logistics. The more we have people thinking that way, the better.”"

There are more than 500 energy drink products on the market, and their increased popularity is matched by a significant rise in energy drink-associated emergency department visits and deaths.

American Heart Association

Manufacturers and fans of these products claim they are as safe as caffeine, but there is little evidence to support that claim.

Caffeine in doses up to 400 mg (about five cups of coffee) is generally recognized as safe by the Food and Drug Administration. While energy drinks usually contain caffeine, little is known about the safety of some of their other ingredients the study team writes in the Journal of the American Heart Association.

To see what effects these other components have, researchers compared physical changes in a group of 18 healthy men and women after consuming a commercially available energy drink and after drinking another concoction with the same amount of caffeine but none of the other ingredients.

Besides 320 mg of caffeine - the amount in about four cups of coffee - the energy drink contained 4 ounces of sugar, several B vitamins and a proprietary ""energy blend"" of taurine and other ingredients that are often found drinks like Monster Energy, Red Bull and 5-Hour Energy.

Sachin A. Shah of David Grant Medical Center on Travis Air Force Base and University of the Pacific in Stockton, California, and colleagues measured the participants’ blood pressure and used an electrocardiogram (often called an ECG or EKG) to measure heart electrical activity for 24 hours after the subjects consumed the drinks.

Related: FDA Checks Into Deaths Linked to Energy Drink

An ECG change known as QTc prolongation and sometimes associated with life-threatening irregularities in the heartbeat was seen after drinking the energy drink, but not after drinking the caffeine beverage, the study team reports.

Several drugs have been withdrawn from the market just for causing ECG changes of a similar magnitude, the authors note.

Blood pressure increased by close to 5 points after drinking the energy drink, but by just under 1 point after drinking the caffeine beverage. Blood pressure also remained elevated six hours later.

These changes are by no means worrisome for healthy individuals, the researchers say, but patients with certain heart conditions might need to exercise caution consuming energy drinks.

Related: Can Caffeine Kill You?

Larger studies are needed to evaluate the safety of the noncaffeine ingredients contained in energy drinks, they conclude.

""The energy drink industry claims that their products are safe because they have no more caffeine than a premium coffee house coffee,” said Dr. Jennifer L. Harris from University of Connecticut's Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity in Storrs, who wasn’t involved in the study.

“However, energy drinks also contain a proprietary ‘energy blend,’ which typically consists of stimulants and other additives. Some of these ingredients (including taurine and guarana) have not been FDA-approved as safe in the food supply, and few studies have tested the effects of caffeine consumption together with these ‘novelty’ ingredients,” she said by email.

“On top of that, energy drinks are highly marketed to adolescent boys in ways that encourage risky behavior, including rapid and excessive consumption,” she said. “As a result, emergency room visits by young people in connection with energy drinks are rising.”

Any research that compares the effects of consuming energy drinks versus caffeine alone provides important evidence for public health advocates who have urged the energy drink companies to stop targeting youth with these potentially harmful products, Harris added.

Energy drinks typically contain high levels of sugar and at least as much caffeine as a cup of coffee. But the drinks also often tout the energy-boosting effects of a mix of other ingredients, ranging from taurine and l-carnitine, naturally occurring amino acids, to ginseng (a Chinese herb typically used in alternative medicine). But despite this ""special blend"" of ingredients, studies suggest energy drinks don't boost attention any better than a cup of coffee does.

Even just one 16-ounce energy drink can increase blood pressure and stress hormones and could put a healthy young adult at risk for heart damage, concludes a 2015 Mayo Clinic study.

http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/finnish-icebreaker-sets-record-earliest-northwest-passage-crossing-n787736,nbcnews,Finnish Icebreaker Sets Record for Earliest Northwest Passage Crossing,[],"NUUK, Greenland — After 24 days at sea and a journey spanning more than 6,214 miles, the Finnish icebreaker MSV Nordica has set a new record for the earliest transit of the fabled Northwest Passage.

The once-forbidding route through the Arctic, linking the Pacific and the Atlantic oceans, has been opening up sooner and for a longer period each summer due to climate change. Sea ice that foiled famous explorers and blocked the passage to all but the hardiest ships has slowly been melting away in one of the most visible effects of man-made global warming.

Records kept by Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans show that the previous earliest passage of the season happened in 2008, when the Canadian Coast Guard ship Louis L. St-Laurent left St. John's in Newfoundland on July 5 and arrived in the Beaufort Sea off Point Barrow on July 30.

The Nordica, with a team of researchers and Associated Press journalists on board, completed a longer transit in less time — albeit in the opposite direction — setting off from Vancouver on July 5 and reaching Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, on July 29.

While the icebreaker encountered Chinese cargo vessels, Alaskan fishing boats and a German cruise ship in the Pacific, upon entering the Canadian Archipelago, the Nordica traveled alone. Radar indicated the presence of the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Sherman near Point Barrow; along the coast an occasional collection of houses revealed evidence of human settlement in the far north.

For the most part, the ship's only companions were Arctic sea birds, seals and the occasional whale, until two-thirds of the way through the voyage, as Nordica was plowing through sea ice in Victoria Strait, a crew member sighted a polar bear.

These animals have come to symbolize the threat posed to Arctic wildlife by climate change because the sea ice they depend on for hunting is disappearing a bit more each year. Scientists predict the Northwest Passage will be largely ice free in the summer by 2050 if current levels of warming continue.

For now, the passage remains a challenge for conventional ships and efforts are being made to prevent frozen waterways that the local Inuit population depends on for travel from being opened up. Yet tourism and other forms of economic development are already under way.

As Nordica sailed through Baffin Bay, the far corner of the North Atlantic that separates Canada and Greenland, it passed cargo ships lining up in the distance. They were preparing to pick up iron ore from a mine on Baffin Island that's expected to operate for decades to come.

On July 26, 1845, an expedition to find the Northwest Passage led by British explorer John Franklin was last sighted off Baffin Island. The expedition never made it. Trapped by sea ice, Franklin and his men perished from cold, illness and starvation. Their two ships were found in 2014 and 2016, not far from where Nordica sighted its first polar bear."
http://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/do-s-don-ts-cheat-meals-according-nutrition-experts-ncna786516,nbcnews,How to cheat on your diet and still lose weight,[],"Subscribe Let our news meet your inbox. SIGN UP

Though nutrition can be highly personalized, one thing most of us share is the urge to let loose every now and then. Whether that’s an ice cream cone on a hot summer day or a plate of fried chicken at a family picnic, sometimes the call of the craving is just too hard to deny. Whether giving into these cravings helps or hurts you in the long run is largely a matter of how you approach it. So, I turned to the pros — nationally recognized registered dietitians — for the top do’s and don’ts for staying in control of cravings.

DON'T DO THIS WHEN YOU CHEAT

1. Don't get consumed by guilt

Like most of the dietitians I turned to, Patricia Bannan, MS, RDN, Nutrition Expert in Los Angeles, CA isn’t fond of the term ‘cheat.’ According to Bannan, “It feeds into the concept of foods being ‘good’ or ‘bad’ or worse, relates your food choices to you as a person being ‘good’ or ‘bad.’”

To avoid eating monstrous portions of your favorite foods, try a small version every day and take the time to enjoy it. To avoid eating monstrous portions of your favorite foods, try a small version every day and take the time to enjoy it.

People often tell me about that critical voice in their head that judges them for overeating. I always advise them to dial that voice down. I’ve said it before but it’s worth repeating: When you take a wrong turn, your GPS doesn’t judge you. Instead, she gently reminds you to take the next U-turn. Bannan offers this gentle reminder: “There are certainly times when people overeat unhealthy foods and feel emotionally and/or physically bad afterwards. The other extreme can be when people deprive themselves completely of all foods they consider ‘bad,’ like ice cream, French fries or chocolate, and then unnecessarily lack enjoyment in their diet or eventually overindulge. It’s really your total diet and total lifestyle that matters.”

In other words, let go of the guilt and return to healthier choices at your next eating occasion. One indulgence won’t make or break a mostly healthy menu.

2. Don't turn a cheat meal into a cheat day, week or month

“While I’m not a fan of the word ‘cheat,’ I think it’s perfectly fine to occasionally indulge. Just do it smartly. Choose one thing you really want, whether it’s ice cream or a pina colada, but don’t give yourself excuses to turn the one indulgence into a whole day or week of overindulging!” advises Amy Gorin, MS, RDN, owner of Amy Gorin Nutrition in Jersey City, NJ.

Another way to look at this: Have the French toast at brunch, but then steer yourself toward a luscious summery salad at your next meal. After all, when you drop your smart phone and crack the screen, you don’t take the next chance to hurl it across the room. Apply that thinking to your menu. Have what you want, but don’t hurl yourself into an all-out unhealthy day (or more) of eating.

3. Don't go into an indulgent meal all-out starving

If you know you’re heading to happy hour, a seasonal barbecue or brunch with friends, it’s helpful to plan smartly. Though you should want to eat with your dining companions, you shouldn’t want to wolf down the first thing you see — and everything else in eyesight. If I’m brunching at 11 AM but I’ve been up since 8 AM, I might munch on a banana or a bowl of berries before heading out. That way, I can make better choices from the menu, opting for, say, avocado toast with a poached egg instead of a stack of pancakes with whipped cream.

An invitation to happy hour might call for a small piece of cheese with some sliced peppers or a side of grapes, allowing me to share the heaping plate of nachos rather than dine on them solo. And speaking of happy hour, remember that booze lowers your inhibitions so stick with one beer, glass of wine or low-sugar cocktail so that you stay in charge of your choices.

DO THIS INSTEAD

1. Do indulge your cravings

All of the pros I consulted with want you to enjoy your cravings. Kaleigh McMordie, RDN from Lubbock, TX has this sage advice: “I think the best food to conquer a craving is the food you are craving.” Like others, McMordie doesn’t believe in cheat meals or going cold turkey on some of your favorite foods. “Denying your body what it really wants often leads to either obsessing about the food, or continuing to eat and seek out foods that won't ever satisfy you. Either one can lead to over-eating.”

I view cooking and eating as an act of love. It’s a beautiful expression to cook someone a meal or break bread with friends. This translates well to the concept of mindfulness and allowing yourself to eat foods you love. In other words, having a fresh, hot, small batch doughnut — a personal favorite of mine—on rare occasions is treating myself with loving kindness. Having one each day is not a loving act, since it isn’t treating myself with care. This example also illustrates what most dietitians know—that some treats are totally worth it, while others are just ‘meh.’ If you’re going for it, make sure it’s worth it!

I think the best food to conquer a craving is the food you are craving. I think the best food to conquer a craving is the food you are craving.

2. Do pinpoint what you're craving and make it healthier

Have a hankering for something chocolatey? Or maybe you’re craving something cheesy or creamy? Take note of what it is you’re really after and then try a subbing something that provides some of the same qualities, suggests Jackie Newgent, RDN, Culinary Nutritionist In Brooklyn, NY. “These grilled hummus quesadillas make a delightful and satisfying pick in place of their extra-cheesy counterpart,” she says.

3. Do create a buffer when you indulge

This is my way of both having a plan and getting back on track. If I know I’m heading to a pool party or boardwalk adventure, I’ll eat lighter meals both before and afterwards. If lunch is particularly heavy, I may not need a snack that day. And I’ll stay tuned to my body — when it’s hungry and when it’s full — so that I’m naturally managing portion sizes of my not-so-healthy meal. I’m not talking about being restrictive here. It’s more about being mindful of your choices. For me, that means if I have more French fries than normal, I balance that out by eating heaps of in-season produce in the form of summery, satisfying salads, layered with whole grains and quality proteins.

“Eat what you crave, just make it with wholesome foods instead of overly processed C.R.A.P. (Chemicals, Refined sugar & flour, Artificial stuff, Preservatives). "" “Eat what you crave, just make it with wholesome foods instead of overly processed C.R.A.P. (Chemicals, Refined sugar & flour, Artificial stuff, Preservatives). ""

4. Do have a small treat every day (really!)

To avoid eating monstrous portions of your favorite foods, try a small version and take the time to enjoy it, suggests Chef Julie Andrews, RDN, from Madison, WI. “That means removing any distractions (TV, driving, talking, reading) while you eat, chewing slowly and paying attention to your senses (smell, touch, taste) in order to fully enjoy the treat,” she says. “When you mindfully eat, you may be surprised to find you only need a few bites to be fully satisfied.”

I take this to heart by enjoying a small bit of dark chocolate or a favorite frozen treat each day. Andrews offers her Carrot Cake Cookie Sandwiches as another example of a small but super-satisfying goodie. If blondies are your thing, Sara Haas RDN, LDN, Chicago-based Culinary Dietitian suggests whipping up a batch of her White Chocolate Chip Blondie Sandwich Bites. Not only are they sized just right, but they’re also made with some whole wheat flour — a touch that brings some nutrition to the party. And who can resist The Best Banana Pudding served in small, individualized mason jars?

5. Do find some better swaps

As I said, none of the nation’s top dietitians were in favor of denying yourself some food pleasures. Instead, they all suggested enjoying small treats that won’t derail your healthy eating goals. Dawn Jackson Blatner, RDN in Chicago, IL has what I think is one of the best pieces of advice! “Eat what you crave, just make it with wholesome foods instead of overly processed C.R.A.P. (Chemicals, Refined sugar & flour, Artificial stuff, Preservatives). Tacos! Pizza! Ranch! Sweets! All our favorites have a superfood version!” I could not agree more! Her Superswap Strawberry Shortcake recipe is a stunning example of how to enjoy this summer staple.

These summery treats are also made with real food ingredients. “My Chocolate Chunk Blueberry Smoothie takes less than 5 minutes to make and satisfies my craving for a frozen treat in a healthier way,” says Bannan. Gorin’s no added sugar banana-based “nice cream” also fits the bill. You’ll see that each of these pack in produce, which boosts the nutrition factor considerably. And though it has a touch of sugar, McMordie’s Homemade Roasted Strawberry Ice Cream is a fresh, wholesome version that will win you over."

Four people died and four survived being infected by the virus, WHO said. It was the first reported outbreak of Ebola since the 2014-2016 epidemic in West Africa that infected more than 28,000 people and killed more than 11,000 of them.

Radio networks operated by Catholic Relief Services were used to get work out about an Ebola outbreak in Congo that was delcared over Sunday Catholic Relief Services

This one was in a far more remote area but aid groups moved in as quickly as they could in a region with few roads and almost no communications to warn people and to control the virus.

""With the end of this epidemic, DRC has once again proved to the world that we can control the very deadly Ebola virus if we respond early in a coordinated and efficient way,” said WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent three disease detectives to help. “This highlights what is possible when countries are prepared to prevent, detect, and respond to disease outbreaks,” the CDC said in a statement.

The CDC trained nine epidemiologists from DRC who helped fight the outbreak.

It’s been 42 days since the last known case.

“A total of 583 contacts were registered and closely monitored, but no known contacts developed signs or symptoms of Ebola virus disease,” the WHO said.

The CDC, WHO and other groups argue strongly for foreign aid to help countries build up their health systems so they can detect outbreaks of disease and stop them before they spread to nearby countries and around the world.

Aid groups had to rebuild roads and bridges to reach the area most affected by the virus. And, complicating matters, the Lord's Resistance Army militia regularly patrols and attacks villages across the region.

The WHO and the government of DRC considered using an experimental Ebola vaccine but, in the end, did not.

“Together with partners, we are committed to continuing support to the government of DRC to strengthen the health system and improve healthcare delivery and preparedness at all levels,” said Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO regional director for Africa."

McCain’s Brain Tumor Is an Aggressive Type of Cancer,"['Shamard Charles', 'Jane Weaver']","The type of brain tumor that doctors removed from Sen. John McCain on Friday is an aggressive one known as a glioblastoma, a highly malignant form of cancer that spreads quickly due to its association with a large network of blood vessels in the brain.

The tumor was associated with a small blood clot above the Arizona Republican's left eye, which doctors removed Friday during a minimally invasive procedure, according to a statement issued by the senator's office Wednesday evening.

Scans completed since Friday indicate that doctors were able to remove all the tumor tissue they could see in the 80-year-old senator's brain. ""The tissue of concern was completely resected by imaging criteria,"" the statement read. The procedure and surgery were performed by doctors at the Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix.

""The Senator and his family are reviewing further treatment options with his Mayo Clinic care team. Treatment options may include a combination of chemotherapy and radiation,"" the statement said.

Here's what we know about this type of cancer:

What is a glioblastoma?

A brain tumor is a mass of abnormal cells growing in the brain. They arise from star-shaped cells that make up the supportive tissue of the brain, also known as astrocytes.

In rare cases, brain and spinal cord cancers are found to run in families, but in most instances people diagnosed with brain tumors have no family history of the disease, according to the American Cancer Society.

The ACS estimates that about 24,000 malignant tumors are diagnosed each year — about three in 10 brain tumors are glioblastomas.

Cancerous tumors of the brain and spinal cord differ from other tumors in the body. For one, glioblastomas don't spread to other organs.

Although the statement from McCain's office stated that doctors believe they removed all of the tumor tissue, microscopic pieces that look like a sea urchin's tentacles could remain and spread to other parts of the brain, according to NBC News medical correspondent Dr. John Torres. Because gliomas have often spread deep into the brain by the time of diagnosis, it is difficult for the cancerous tissue to be completely removed.

McCain has a history of melanoma, a deadly skin cancer that can spread to the brain. The cause of his brain tumor has not been determined, but a 2014 study published in the Annals of Epidemiology found that incidences of gliomas were greater among melanoma cases than in people who had never been diagnosed with skin cancer.

Are there symptoms?

With any kind of brain mass, patients typically complain of symptoms such as double vision, forgetfulness or headaches, Torres said. These nonspecific symptoms make it nearly impossible to diagnose based on symptoms alone. Furthermore, symptoms may not persist. For example, headaches associated with a brain tumor may be more painful in the morning and improve during the day.

Related: McCain's Questions at Comey Hearing Left Many Confused

Some people are unaware they have a brain tumor until experiencing a seizure, according to the American Cancer Society. In 2009, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy died at age 77 from a malignant brain tumor after first suffering a seizure.

It's possible the brain tumor was linked to McCain's uncharacteristically incoherent line of questioning during congressional testimony last month by former FBI Director James Comey.

What are the next steps?

McCain's office had previously said he would be recovering from the blood clot procedure for at least the next week. Following this period of rest, treatment to eradicate any cancer cells that might be present typically ensues.

Treatment options might include a combination of chemotherapy drugs to attack the malignant cells and radiation on a daily basis, Dr. Torres said. It's possible McCain could return to the Senate while undergoing treatment, and the senator's statement said his Mayo Clinic care team will determine when, or if, he can get back to work.

What is the prognosis?

“Glioblastoma is a bleak diagnosis but in comparison to when Ted Kennedy was diagnosed, our outlook is much more hopeful due to tremendous advances in research,” said neurosurgeon Dr. Steven Kalkanis, chairman of the department of neurosurgery at the Henry Ford Cancer Institute in Detroit. ""The median survival rates range from 16 to 18 months, but I have seen patients live for 10 years with new therapy.""

New and promising clinical trials, such as being conducted by biotechnology company Tocagen and the Optune device, use low dose electricity and viruses to inhibit cell growth to improve survival for patients with glioblastomas. But Kalkanis notes that “survival is directly linked to how much tumor is removed.”

A new drug recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, 5-Amino-Levulinic Acid (5-ALA) or Gliolan, is a substance that patients drink before surgery which lights up tumor cells in a magenta or violet color making tumor visualization and removal much easier for surgeons.

Whether McCain is a candidate for these new therapies or clinical trials remains to be seen.

The veteran lawmaker, who fought in Vietnam and was a prisoner of war for more than five years, is known as a fighter.

However, his advanced age could make recovery more difficult, as only about 10 percent of patients live longer than five years following diagnosis.

According to the official statement from McCain's office, ""The Senator's doctors say he is recovering from his surgery 'amazingly well' and his underlying health is excellent.""

McCain is currently recovering at his home in Arizona."

http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/commentary-erasing-lgbtq-people-faith-fake-news-n784371,nbcnews,Commentary: Erasing LGBTQ People of Faith Is Fake News,['Guthrie Graves-Fitzsimmons'],"Dear journalists covering religion, LGBTQ people of faith exist. Does your reporting reflect that reality?

“When it’s sexuality versus religion, Americans stand divided,” a recent Religion News Service headline read. “Can Religious Freedom and LGBT Rights Co-Exist?” asked the Atlantic in a video series. National Public Radio even aired a seven minute report, “In Religious Freedom Debate, 2 American Values Clash,” that juxtaposed LGBTQ rights against religious rights.

These religion headlines advance the conservative Christian view that you can’t be openly LGBTQ and religious. That’s one view, but reporting it as some kind of objective reality constitutes fake news. Religion journalists, in their pursuit of objective reporting, have no ground to willingly ignore the existence of LGBTQ people of faith.

The reader is left to believe one of two things: journalists who report on the clash of LGBTQ and religious rights are ignorant of LGBTQ religious folks existence, which seems highly unlikely in 2017, or that they actually believe the conservative position. My suspicion is that the latter is often at play under the surface, but I write today to ensure the former becomes less of an excuse.

Journalistic ethics should make it so this question never comes up.

We can disagree about theological ethics. My disagreements with conservative religious ethics go well beyond the existence of LGBTQ religious adherents and include such varied topics as female ordination and dancing. (For the record, I support female ordination and dancing.) Would you ever see religion reporters completely erase female religious leaders, even though the conservative position is that they shouldn’t exist? “Religious values” and “women’s rights” are never touted as being mutually exclusive.

I welcome disagreement and religion reporters illuminating the debates within all religious traditions. But we can’t disagree about my existence. Covering LGBTQ rights and religion as purely opposing forces is journalistic malpractice.

The Atlantic’s McKay Coppins recently told Sojourners’ God Beat podcast that it’s more difficult to “come out” as religious in elite newsrooms than gay. He certainly has a point. The media’s obsession with conservative Christians makes them seem synonymous with Christians and even religion at-large in the average person’s eyes. Coming out as religious is then interpreted as coming out as pro-LGBTQ discrimination, which is rightly frowned upon in secular workplaces. The solution to Coppins’ dilemma is simple: promote the existence of LGBTQ people of faith.

Related: Waiting Until Marriage: Gay Christians Navigate Faith, Sexuality

As a gay, Christian writer myself, I can testify to the fact that coming out as religious in secular spaces is made immensely easier when there is greater understanding that “religious” does not necessarily equal “socially conservative.” Unfortunately, like many of his colleagues on the God Beat, Coppins leaves the discussion with religious and gay communities in seemingly separate camps.

Religion journalists do have positive examples to draw upon.

Christian cake baker Jack Phillips recently stopped by ABC News’ ""The View"" as his case heads to the Supreme Court. His lawyer, Kristen K. Waggoner, made the familiar conservative argument “the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman cuts across all the major religions.” That’s a well-rehearsed talking point, but a blatantly false argument. Waggoner made it twice on air before being challenged.

ABC News Correspondent and ""View"" Co-Host Sara Haines responded, “Actually, that’s evolved in a lot of religions.” Waggoner tried to cut her off by saying, ""No, it actually hasn’t."" Haines continued on undeterred. “My brother is gay, and in our church it’s fine for him to get married. There are a lot of God-fearing, Christian gays that are accepted and loved,” she said to cheers from the studio audience.

Responsible journalism shouldn’t be dependent on journalists having gay brothers.

Religion journalists should make the effort to note that ideas like Waggoner’s are one perspective on Christianity, but not the only one. It might even help to quote polling showing most religious Americans do not support religiously based service refusals to gay people.

Perhaps a decade ago it would have been justifiable to write off the religious and queer community in religion reporting as insignificant. As a closeted gay high school student very active in my church’s youth group a decade ago, I wish there would have been more courageous journalism.

I still remember reading a great article, “Even on Religious Campuses, Students Fight for Gay Identity,” by former New York Times reporter Erik Eckholm in 2011 when I was in college and not long after I came out. “Many of the newly assertive students grew up as Christians and developed a sense of their sexual identities only after starting college, and after years of inner torment,” he wrote.

Visiting the New York Times newsroom last year, I had the chance to thank Eckholm for writing the article. The ways journalists cover religion and sexuality may not seem significant, but it has a profound impact on people’s religious practice. Most people are raised in a specific tradition -- or no tradition -- and the media is the only way they can experience different religious ideas.

The Society of Professional Journalists' Code of Ethics includes “Be vigilant and courageous about holding those with power accountable. Give voice to the voiceless.” Religion journalists have a choice to cover courageous queer people of faith or reinforce destructive power dynamics from religious leaders seeking to maintain power. Which path upholds the mission of journalism?

Imagine a closeted queer teenager in a conservative religious community. Imagine the damage reading the headline “When it’s sexuality versus religion, Americans stand divided” does to that teen’s self-esteem. They are left feeling like they must choose between their own sexuality and religion.

That’s fake news. A vibrant and growing religious and queer community exits. Religion reporters have an ethical responsibility to not erase us from the story.

Circuit Judge Glenn Kelley imposed the sentence on Dalia Dippolito, who was convicted last month of solicitation of first-degree murder. She was recorded on video and audio in 2009 as she plotted to have Michael Dippolito killed, telling an undercover detective she was ""5,000 percent sure"" she wanted her husband dead.

Kelley said Dippolito acted in a ""cold and calculated manner.""

""This particular crime was committed not in an unsophisticated way, but in a sophisticated way in a calculated fashion,"" Kelley said. ""There was a plan put in place by Dalia Dippolito to kill Mike Dippolito."" He said the evidence showed that Dalia Dippolito may have been manipulating two other men in her effort to kill her husband.

Neither Dippolito nor her family showed any reaction when the sentence was handed down.

A 2011 conviction and 20-year sentence had been thrown out on appeal. A retrial last fall ended with a 3-3 hung jury. This time, it took the six-member jury 90 minutes to convict Dippolito, 34, who had a child last year while under house arrest.

Prosecutors believe she wanted control of the couple's town house and her husband's savings. The case gained national attention when Boynton Beach police video from the investigation went viral on the internet and was featured on the TV shows ""Cops"" and ""20/20.""

Boynton Beach's cooperation with ""Cops"" had been a key part of the defense, as Dippolito's attorneys argued detectives manipulated her and their investigation to play to the cameras. Kelley said that while ""theater"" should not be part of law enforcement and the investigation wasn't perfect, he believes the detectives saved Michael Dippolito's life.

""The evidence supports that Miss Dippolito wanted him killed,"" Kelley said. While prosecutors argued for a 30-year sentence, Kelley said he agreed with the previous judge's sentence but gave her four years credit for the eight years she spent on house arrest.

Michael Dippolito, a convicted conman, testified Friday that his wife's actions ruined his life. He said her unsubstantiated claims of spousal abuse as the reason for her actions still haunt him. He said that when he was arrested for stock trading fraud, he plead guilty and accepted his prison sentence and she should have done the same.

""People will say, 'You're really lucky to be alive,'"" Michael Dippolito said. ""I guess but I can't get to that because I had to deal with this nonsense for nine years,"" referring to the three trials. He testified he met his ex-wife in October 2008 when he hired her for sex, but they hit it off so well they were married in February. Within a month, he said, she was stealing money from him and trying to get his probation revoked by planting drugs in his truck and, he believes, spiked his ice tea with antifreeze in an attempt to kill him.

Michael Dippolito testifies during the sentencing hearing for his ex-wife, Dalia Dippolito on July 21, 2017, in West Palm Beach, Florida. Lannis Waters / Palm Beach Post via AP

Prosecutor Craig Williams called Dippolito ""a master manipulator"" who needed to be imprisoned ""to protect society.""

""If she wants something, first-degree murder is not enough for her,"" Williams said. ""She'll do whatever it takes.""

Defense attorney Craig Rosenfeld unsuccessfully argued for probation, saying Dalia Dippolito had lived an ""exemplary life"" and she should not be judged by ""the worst moment of her life."" After the hearing, he said he respected Kelley's sentence but an appeal is planned.

Williams and co-prosecutor Laura Laurie argued during the latest trial that the evidence against Dippolito was overwhelming. They played a 23-minute video in which Dippolito told undercover officer Widy Jean she wanted her husband killed and agreed to pay $7,000. She also discussed various plots before Jean said he would kill her husband at the couple's home, making it look like a botched burglary while she was at the gym.

Prosecutors also read for the jury X-rated text messages Dalia Dippolito exchanged with a now-deceased lover, Mike Stanley, in 2009 after she got married.

She had Stanley impersonate a doctor, to help her hide the $100,000 theft by pretending to be pregnant, and later a lawyer, to make her husband wrongly think he had completed probation, prosecutors said. She hoped that if her husband stopped visiting his probation officer, he would be found in violation and returned to prison. In one text message, she rejoiced after persuading her husband to put their town house in her name only; in another, she complained after learning she still couldn't sell it without his signature."

The bombing continued the unrelenting violence that has killed more than 1,700 civilians in Afghanistan so far this year.

The Taliban, which is battling the Western-backed government and a NATO-led coalition for control of Afghanistan, has launched a wave of attacks around the country in recent days, sparking fighting in more than half a dozen provinces.

""I was in my shop when suddenly I heard a terrible sound and as a result all of my shop windows shattered,"" said Ali Ahmed, a resident in the area of Monday's blast.

Government security forces said a small bus owned by the Ministry of Mines had been destroyed in the blast but the National Directorate for Security, the main intelligence agency, said none of its personnel had been hit.

Three civilian vehicles and 15 shops were destroyed or damaged in the blast, the Interior Ministry said in a statement.

At least 1,662 civilians had already been killed in Afghanistan in the first half of the year.

Kabul has accounted for at least 20 percent of all civilian casualties this year, including at least 150 people killed in a massive truck bomb attack at the end of May, according to United Nations figures.

The highest-paid running back in the NFL currently is Bills running back LeSean McCoy. At 29, he’s one of the older workhorse tailbacks, too.

He plans to hold the latter distinction for a while.

“I feel good,” McCoy told reporters on Friday after the issue of his 29th birthday came up. “I feel the same. I feel young. I feel 25. Making the same runs, same cuts. I feel good. Explosive. That’s my game being explosive and quick. So when that kind of turns and then leaves, then I’ll be in trouble. But for now, I feel fine. I could keep doing this ’til I’m about 33 man.”

Why 33?

“I don’t know,” he said. “I thought about just playing 10 years in the NFL and getting to 30 and that’s easy. I’m going to have a good year this year, we’re going to win some games. That’s easy, 30, ten years. So you look past that. I’m chasing something that I didn’t think I could do coming in. I set a mark and I feel like I passed that mark so I’m just trying to move on.”

One of the things that fuels McCoy is his lingering love of the game.

“I look at a lot of players who left the game early and I’m sure they think about it, if they should have stayed or could or would,” McCoy said. “But I love this game. I’ve been playing this game all my life, you know, and it’s brought me a lot. You know so I’ll have fun with it. We have a good team here, a good coach in Sean [McDermott] and the guys around him. So, I’m very positive about this year. I look forward to it.”

His finds motivation in that fact that “[i]t seems like everyone is against us and we don’t have a shot,” along with trying to get a rushing title. McCoy also made it clear that he has changed his diet and other things in order to get the most out of his aging body. He declined to reveal his secrets, other than to say he now spends the offseason “watching what I eat, limit the drinks and the long nights.”

Whatever he did last year, it worked. He had nearly 1,300 yards rushing and 5.4 yards per carry, along with 14 total touchdowns and 50 catches."

“Those are policies that are going to make these communities more vulnerable and are going to empower traffickers because they’ll be able to take advantage of these communities,"" she said.

The truck driver in the San Antonio case, James Matthew Bradley Jr., 60, of Clearwater, Fla., was charged Monday with one count of transporting undocumented immigrants ""for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain to wit.""

He could face life in prison or even the death penalty if convicted, officials said.

One the victims, Adan Lara Vega, told the Associated Press from his hospital bed Monday that he paid $5,500 for a ride from Mexico into the United States. He had been told the truck would be air conditioned.

""After an hour I heard ... people crying and asking for water. I, too, was sweating and people were despairing,"" Lara Vega said. ""That's when I lost consciousness.""

The latest tragedy brings to mind what has been called the deadliest human smuggling case in modern U.S. history: In 2003, in Victoria, Texas, 19 people died in the back of a truck belonging to Tyrone Williams, who got paid $7,500 to drive them through a Border Patrol checkpoint.

Like the San Antonio truck, there was no air conditioning in Williams' vehicle, and the victims died of dehydration and suffocation.

Acting ICE Director Thomas Homan said in a statement Sunday that he had ""personally worked"" on the Victoria case and said human smuggling poses a threat to U.S. and to the safety of those being smuggled.

""The horrific crime uncovered last night ranks as a stark reminder of why human smuggling networks must be pursued, caught and punished,"" Homan said. ""These networks have repeatedly shown a reckless disregard for those they smuggle, as last night’s case demonstrates.""

ICE officials on Monday stressed the importance of reporting suspected human smuggling operations by calling the Homeland Security Investigations Tip Line at 866-DHS-2ICE.

Staton, the ICE official, called human smuggling ""100 percent a crime against humanity.""

""This is just victimizing people that are attempting to get a better life,” he said."

Google Trends tweeted a map on Tuesday showing “America’s Most Misspelled Words,” based on the top “how to spell” searches in each state in 2017 so far.

The word people in Wisconsin need most help spelling: Wisconsin.

Badger State Gov. Scott Walker’s office did not immediately respond to request for comment.

The rest of the “most misspelled words” per state ranged from some as short as “liar” (R.I.) and “gray” (Georgia) to longer and more complicated ones such as “pneumonia"" (Washington) to ""supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" (Connecticut) from the movie ""Mary Poppins.""

“If you look at how people spell on the internet, that also should scare you,” said Tom Karls, an administrative clerk with the Madison Public Library in Wisconsin.

Karls said he found it ""dumbfounding"" that Wisconsinites had so much trouble spelling the name of their state, and that it showed modern society’s reliance on Google rather than the dictionary or other, traditional reference material.

“If you think about it though, that’s... wow,” he said.

“It becomes a great commentary on the education trends of our society,” he added.

Emma Coronel Aispuro, 27, waved at the drug kingpin from the second row of the public seating area when he was brought into the packed courtroom for a hearing.

The 59-year-old accused cartel leader wore jailhouse blues and locked eyes frequently with his wife, a U.S. citizen who was raised in Mexico.

Coronel, who listened to a translation of the hearing through headphones, married Guzman a decade ago while he was a fugitive after his first Mexican prison breakout.

A mother of twin girls, she has said she doesn't recognize the portrait authorities have painted of her husband as a ruthless drug trafficker who exported millions of pounds of cocaine to the United States and ordered his rivals murdered.

Coronel did not speak to reporters after the hearing, rushing to a taxi in black stilettos as a horde of international media crowded around her.

But a woman who identified herself as one of Guzman's 16 children and gave her name as Rosa stood outside the federal courthouse in the rain and said she missed him.

""I am sad about what's happening,"" she said in Spanish.

She said she had not seen her father in more than a year before Friday's court appearance and sthat he wept when she laid eyes on him.

""I love him a lot,"" she said. ""He is not alone.""

But Guzman is very much alone at the Metropolitan Correctional Center's Special Housing Unit, where he is kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day, except for meetings with his court-appointed lawyers from the non-profit Federal Defenders of New York.

Prosecutors have not allowed him to meet with Coronel, whose father and brother are accused of being members of the Sinaloa cartel. This week, a judge gave him permission to exchange messages with her, but said the FBI, the DEA and other agencies can screen them first.

The judge set a trial date for April 2018 but conceded that might be ambitious given the sprawling nature of the case, which covers two decades of alleged crimes. The trial, prosecutors said, could last up to three months. The evidence includes 1,500 recordings and 10,000 documents, the attorneys said.

Guzman's defense team complained that the government has still not turned over the documents that led to his extradition from Mexico to the U.S. And they questioned whether the proceedings in Brooklyn are even legal since the extradition petition called for Guzman to be brought to Texas or California, not New York.

They also argued that they should be allowed to have contact visits with Guzman, while prosecutors say there is no area in the MCC that is secure enough to let the two-time prison escapee sit next to his lawyers.

The judge seemed to agree that it is too cumbersome for Guzman and his lawyers to be separated by a partition while reviewing mountains of paperwork and said he would send a magistrate to the Manhattan lockup to review the situation.

The bulk of the session was devoted to a hearing on whether El Chapo's public defenders have a conflict of interest because other lawyers in their office have briefly represented confidential witnesses who may testify against him.

Guzman waived the conflict, telling the judge through a translator, ""I would like to continue with my current attorneys because I feel well with them.""

Guzman has already met with at least 16 private lawyers but has said he can't hire another attorney until he communicates with his wife about who would pay the legal fees. The feds are seeking the forefeiture of $14 billion in drug proceeds, but his public defender said Friday that the feds have not been able to find ""a single dollar."""
http://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/5-advantages-being-older-parent-ncna775581,nbcnews,"Older dads have 'geekier' kids, plus 5 more perks of being an older parent",[],"Subscribe Let our news meet your inbox. SIGN UP

Try as science might to discern the ‘right’ age to have children, the window remains a shifting target. For example, the ideal timeframe from a biological standpoint may not prove ideal from a social-emotional standpoint. There’s also the gap in biological clocks between men and women to consider in examining the health benefits and detriments of parenting at various ages.

As any pregnant woman ""of advanced maternal age"" will tell you, the risks of carrying a child over the age of 35 are well-documented. The March of Dimes states pregnant women over the age of 35 could face potentially dangerous complications, such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia and high blood pressure. There are also many risks of complications that can affect the offspring of an older mom, such as premature birth and an increased risk of Down Syndrome. A recent Danish study followed children over an 18-year period and found children born to older moms had an increased risk of developing mental disorders, heart diseases, circulatory diseases, and congenital malformations.

Though, unlike women, male reproductive organs don’t come with as boldly written an expiration date requiring medical (or divine) intervention, numerous recent studies have revealed that sperm does, indeed, get old, and advanced paternal age can also contribute to certain health issues of their children. One study attributes age-related mutations in sperm to an increased risk of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), while another study attributes older sperm to a 10-20 percent increased risk of psychiatric illness.

All this said, emerging science also reveals a bevy of benefits to be experienced by both parents and their offspring during what experts almost offensively refer to as advanced maternal or paternal age, and they’re mighty compelling, to boot.

You May Have Yourself a Smarty Pants

Turns out, if you’re an older dad, odds are your kid will be a brain. A study just published in Translational Psychiatry provided evidence that older fathers tend to sire “geekier” progeny. Researchers from both the U.K and U.S. examined data of 15,000 sets of twins collected from tests to measure their “geek” traits (including I.Q., Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) grades, interests and social skills) at the age of 12. Researchers compiled that information, as well as input from their parents, to craft a “geek index score” to run up against their parent’s ages. They learned that kids born to older dads are more likely to have a high IQ, and a stronger ability to focus on their interests. Also, they aren’t as distracted by a desire to fit in socially, and are thus more likely to achieve what they called “educational success,” which leads to a stronger socioeconomic status.

Your Kids Might Live Longer

Though, for both genders of parents, advanced age carries an increased risk of the development of chromosomal abnormalities in utero, one 2012 Harvard University study shows a link between advanced paternal age and chromosomes that lead to longer life spans. As it turns out, aging sperm might produce children with longer telomeres, or tips of chromosomes, that protect DNA while being copied, which is linked to longevity for not one, but two generations of offspring.

You're More Emotionally Prepared

According to Live Science, University of California, San Francisco researches conducted a small study that set out to establish an “optimal” age for parenting. Most respondents believed being an “older” parent was more advantageous than being a younger parent, mostly because they were more “emotionally prepared.” Parents of both genders in the study overwhelmingly said their 30s would’ve been the ideal parenting era. Other advantages of being an older parent? More career success, financial security and stronger relationships with their partners.

You're More Likely to Get Your Kids Off to a Healthy Start

A large 2012 study published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) found that little kids with older moms were healthier than kids with younger moms. Researchers took an overall snapshot of the health and wellbeing of a select group of children up to the age of 5. They learned the children with older moms had fewer accidental injuries, fewer social and emotional difficulties and were further along in language development.

You're Less Likely to Lose It

Being an older mom also has its benefits when it comes to patience. A 2016 Danish study found that older mothers were more adept at setting boundaries with their kids, and were less likely to yell at and harshly punish them, leading to fewer behavioral, social and emotional difficulties down the road. They also had less anxiety during pregnancy, had more stable relationships, and were in better shape financially — all factors that can contribute to a more chill parenting experience.

You'll Be More Financially Stable

It seems like common sense that older parents are more likely to have established financially stability — but there’s actual proof. A Danish study published by PLOS One established a link between a woman’s age with when she first became a parent and her lifetime earning ability. Apparently, for moms both with and without college degrees, those who first gave birth when they were younger than 25 suffered the most lifetime labor income loss, whereas women who started having kids after 31 went on to experience financial gains.

You’ll Be Better Equipped To Access Your Parenting Memories

Believe it or not, hormones can have an impact how your brain functions — and a 2016 University of Southern California study proves it. As it turns out, being an older mom can work in your favor when it comes to your mental state later in life.After examining a group of over 800 women between the ages of 41 and 92, researchers discovered the women who had their last baby after 35 had better cognition and verbal memory later in life than those who first became parents young. They also found that women who used contraceptives for more than 10 years, or got their first periods before the age of 13, fared better when it came to problem-solving and executive functioning when they aged."

It comes together in a handy list of what to eat more of and what to eat less of.

What to eat more of:

Nuts

Seafood rich in omega-3 fatty acids

Vegetables

Fruits

Whole grains

Polyunsaturated fats (such as soybean oil, corn oil, walnuts and flaxseed oil)

What to eat less of:

Sodium

Processed meats

Sugar-sweetened beverages

Red meat (such as steak or pork chops)

Renata Micha of Tufts and colleagues developed their list from national surveys covering 16,000 people from 1999-2012. Volunteers filled out food diaries in real time, and were followed for years after to see what happened to their health.

In 2012, Micha’s team wrote, more than 700,000 Americans died of heart disease, stroke or diabetes. “Of these, an estimated 45 percent (318,656 due to heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes) were associated with suboptimal intakes of the 10 dietary factors,” they wrote in their report in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Related: Kids' Diets Put Them on the Road to Heart Disease

They used published studies on the benefits or drawbacks of each of the 10 foods to figure out just how much each one contributes to the risk of death from heart disease.

By their calculations, eating too much sodium (more than 2,000 mg a day) accounted for 9.5 percent of the deaths. Eating too few nuts (less than about a handful a day) accounted for 8.5 percent of deaths; eating too much processed meat accounted for 8.2 percent of deaths; eating too little seafood was responsible for 7.8 percent of the deaths.

""These results should help identify priorities, guide public health planning, and inform strategies to alter dietary habits and improve health,"" they wrote.

They left out monounsaturated fats such as olive oil, vitamin D, magnesium, calcium, antioxidant vitamins, dairy products, cocoa, coffee, and tea because they could not find enough evidence to assign a specific value to their benefits.

And the effects varied by age group, sex and ethnicity. In adults under 65, too many sweet drinks and processed meat were the biggest killers. For people over 65, eating too much salt and too few nuts and veggies were the culprits.

Blacks and Hispanics were more strongly affected by the dietary factors than whites, the researchers found — especially when it came to sweet drinks. “Overall, suboptimal diet was associated with 53.1 percent of total estimated cardiometabolic deaths among blacks, 50 percent among Hispanics, and 42.8 percent among whites,” they wrote.

Related: Veggies Could Stop Development of Heart Disease

The findings may be oversimplified, Noel Mueller and Dr. Lawrence Appel of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who were not part of the study, wrote in a commentary.

“For example, should saturated fat have been included among the dietary factors? Randomized trials conducted decades ago demonstrated that replacement of saturated fat with polyunsaturated vegetable oil reduced cardiovascular disease events by 18 percent to 41 percent,” they wrote.

But the report is useful anyway, they concluded.

“Whether the authors overestimated or underestimated the potential effects of improved diet, the likely benefits are substantial and justify policies designed to improve diet quality.”

The American Heart Association has for decades stressed that food is a major factor in preventing America's No. 1 cause of death. And many studies have shown that Americans eat far too much meat, cheese, processed grains, sugar and salt.

Studies also back the health effects of a daily handful of nuts, eating more vegetables, fruits and whole grains, as well as the omega-3 fatty acids found in some fish, walnuts, leafy greens and flaxseed.

Diets rich in vegetables, fruit, vegetable oils, and whole grains also lower the risk of cancer, Alzheimer's disease and diabetes."

Fans quickly pointed out that the NFL team had a bye week when he posted the claim, making the suite offer unlikely.

So far the rapper’s response to the fallout appears to be another Instagram post stating: “My hustle is non stop. I never stop hustling.”

But there are ways that parents, caregivers and teachers - as well as policy makers and legislators - can work to narrow the gap.

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS WRITE IN CLASSROOM AP Images

Recommendations in a recently released report include encouraging and teaching parents on how to incorporate math into everyday learning, giving teachers the most up-to-date and effective tools to make math learning easy and engaging throughout the day, and urging more enrollment in center-based day care and early education programs. The report also cites data showing the advantages of full-day kindergarten.

Boosting Hispanic children's math skills is critical to the nation's future, since one out of four kindergarten students are Latino, explains Lina Guzmán, the author of a new Child Trends Hispanic Institute report, Make Math Count More for Young Latino Children.

""Latino children are twice as likely to be living in poverty as white children, and much of that gap in early math skills between Latino and black children is explained by poverty,"" said Guzman, who is also the Institute's director. Poverty also contributes to lower rates of enrollment and participation in center-based child care and programs, which boosts learning. Low-income families also have fewer books at home.

Despite the data, there are several different things adults can do to help improve these statistics, and parents can help in relatively easy ways.

""The great thing is we can integrate this, we don't have to make a half hour block to do math skills, we can do this while we're cooking, while we're shopping, while we're walking to school, or by counting the number of trees that we see,"" said Guzmán.

She adds that it doesn't matter what language parents interact with their children in, as long as it incorporates more books and more math games.

Teachers and educators should use lesson plans that help develop math skills throughout the school day.

Policy makers and legislators should be pushing to expand Head Start and universal pre-kindergarten programs, as well as full-day kindergarten.

""Latino children who attend full day kindergarten experience greater increases in their early math skills during the year,"" said Guzmán."" What we found is that 87 percent of Latino children are already in full day kindergarten, so we only have a little bit more to go before all Latino children are involved.""

While expanding these programs costs money, in the long run it pays off. And right now the U.S. ranks 18 among industrialized nations when it comes to numeracy.

""Policymakers are recognizing, increasingly, not only what neuroscience is teaching us, but that during those early years incredible brain development is happening and that is sort of where you get your biggest bang for your buck,"" Guzmán said.

Eisenstein'],"The same automaker that aired an ad about a young girl overcoming sexism during the 2017 Super Bowl is now facing a global backlash over a television spot that suggested husbands-to-be give their prospective brides the same scrutiny they do a used car — or horse.

The 30-second commercial shows the mother of the groom running up to closely inspect the bride-to-be, at one point opening up her mouth to check her teeth. She later gives a disapproving look at the young woman’s chest, which the bride quickly tries to cover up.

“An important decision must be made carefully. Only with an official certification can you relax,” the narrator says in an English translation of the Chinese script, the commercial then cutting to a shot of a new Audi vehicle.

The commercial, which was also aired in Chinese movie theaters, has sparked a local backlash and global outrage. “Would Audi air such a discriminatory commercial in Europe or the U.S.?” one post on the Chinese social media site Weibo asked. Translated from Chinese, the poster wrote, “It assumes romantic relationships for Chinese men and women are just like this: dominated by the mother-in-law, controlled by the male and with a passive female.”

There were nearly half a million posts, most critical, on the Chinese social media site Tencent, according to news reports.

For its part, Audi rushed to do damage control. ""The ad’s perception that has been created for many people does not correspond to the values of our company in any way,"" the luxury arm of Germany’s Volkswagen Group said in a statement.

It appears the goal was to play off the Chinese stereotype of fussy parents who routinely find fault with their new family members. Adding that it “deeply regrets” the airing of the commercial, it said it was created by an agency working for the used car division of a joint venture it operates in China. Foreign automakers are required by Chinese rules to partner with local manufacturers.

Audi said it would launch an investigation and take steps to ensure the problem isn’t repeated. The automaker can’t afford to alienate Chinese buyers. The Audi brand is the most popular marque in the fast-growing Chinese luxury segment but faces intense competition from brands like Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Cadillac, Lincoln and Lexus.

As in the U.S., Chinese women are becoming an increasing force in car sales. The flap over the Chinese ad, meanwhile, hits a company that had, barely a half-year earlier, received strong kudos for a spot that aired during the Super Bowl. While most game-day ads rely on humor, Audi chose to tackle a serious social issue. “What should I tell my daughter,” began the narrator of the 60-second spot, as he watches his daughter race on a go-kart track, “that she will automatically be valued less than every man she'll ever meet?""

Of course, it was still a car commercial, and eventually displayed an Audi S5 Sportback. But in sharp contrast to the Chinese commercial, the Super Bowl spot ended with Audi pledging equal pay for equal work, with the tagline, “Progress is for everyone.”

The Chinese commercial suggests that progress isn’t always a straight line."

http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/why-banda-islands-were-once-more-valuable-manhattan-n787006,nbcnews,Why the Banda Islands Were Once More Valuable Than Manhattan,['Ian Williams'],"BANDA NEIRA, Indonesia — New York City has long been a center of global commerce, making it is easy to forget that 350 years ago the balance of economic power was very different and weighted toward a clutch of islands in what is now Indonesia.

The Banda Islands were once at the heart of the world’s biggest and most important trade — in spices. A part of what was historically known as the Spice Islands and now Indonesia, they consist of 10 tiny specks in the vast Banda Sea and have a population of just 15,000.

On July 31, 1667, an extraordinary deal was struck: England officially swapped two of the small islands for a swampy Dutch colony once known as New Amsterdam — now New York. The rest, as they say, is history.

The Banda Islands, better known as the Spice Islands are 10 tiny specks in the Banda Sea. Ian Williams / for NBC News

Back then, the Banda Islands had a monopoly on nutmeg. It was the only place it grew, and the spice was worth more by weight than gold. The Dutch — European pioneers in the business of colonization — wanted total control, and were willing to give up what was then a North American backwater to achieve it.

While the experience of the now isolated and impoverished Bandanese at the hands of European colonialists can be seen as a condemnation of international trade and globalization, the locals are determined to use the anniversary of the historic swap to draw renewed attention to the lush island's complex history and its pristine natural resources.

Manhattan Transfer

The islands can be reached by two flights a week, both on tiny 12-seat aircraft, touching down on a short and bumpy airstrip in the shadow of a brooding volcano — and only if the weather permits and the aircraft is available.

They are still littered with the remains of Dutch forts, a legacy of the bitter colonial scrap over rich natural resources. A road, Jalan Manhattan, snakes up the hill of Run, one of the islands ceded to the Dutch. Locals refer to the 17th century deal as the “Manhattan Transfer.”

“New York may be a center of finance, but the Banda Islands are the capital of mega-marine biodiversity. It’s a special environment,” said Tanya Alwi, the matriarch of the leading family on the islands.

Her father, Des Alwi, who died in 2010, was known as the islands' king, the principal among their seven traditional leaders or ""orang kayas.""

In New York today, you would be hard-pressed to find many people aware of the islands or the deal that changed the course of their city’s history. Alwi is determined to change that.

She is using the anniversary to mount a series of exhibitions on the Treaty of Breda, which marked an end of the second Anglo-Dutch War and ceded control of New Amsterdam to the English. What is now Manhattan had been seized already by the British a few years prior to the treaty — it just codified what was already a reality on the ground at the time.

A giant sculpture of a nutmeg shell has been commissioned from a Balinese artist and is looking for a Manhattan home. Ronald Jenkins, a theater professor at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, has written a play on the area entitled “Islands: The Lost History of the Treaty That Changed the World.”

And New Jersey's Rutgers University is helping navigate a UNESCO World Heritage application for the islands.

World's finest nutmeg

The spice trade began in the Middle East more than 4,000 years ago, with Chinese, Arab and Malay traders bringing spices to Europe mostly by camel along the old Silk Road. They kept the origins of the valuable spice a secret — prompting European navigators to set out in search of it. Christopher Columbus was trying to find a route to the Spice Islands when he discovered the Americas instead.

Spices, including nutmeg, peppercorn, clove and cinnamon, were prized by European aristocracy as a seasoning, though they’d later also be used to disguise rancid food and for medication.

The Portuguese won the race to find the fabled Banda Islands in 1512, leading Portuguese, Spanish, English and Dutch colonialists to fight over the coveted land. The losers were the Bandanese themselves. The Dutch massacred traditional leaders, killed and expelled thousands of others, and replaced them with slaves and convicts.

The massacre is illustrated in gory detail in paintings in a tiny museum in Banda Neira, the main town.

Banda nutmeg is still regarded as the finest in the world, but the spice is now grown in several other countries. And the trade in Indonesia is controlled by powerful traders from elsewhere in the country. The U.S. is the biggest importer of spices, including nutmeg, and customized spice mixes have become fashionable among celebrity Manhattan chefs and top-end restaurants — the haunts of New York’s own aristocracy.

“We really have to take back control of our own nutmeg, create our own brand,” said Alwi.

Pristine underwater environment

Today, the Bandas' most prized asset is their underwater environment, including the world’s fastest growing and most resilient reef. It sprung to life on the lava flow from a 1988 volcanic eruption and both delights and puzzles marine biologists.

“I’ve seen nothing like it. It’s really quite unique,” said Mareike Huhn, scientific coordinator for Luminocean, a conservation group, who has been studying Banda’s reefs for five years.

The Banda Islands once attracted celebrity visitors, including Mick Jagger, and Princess Diana, whose portrait hangs in the lobby of a weathered waterfront hotel. But the tourist business was abruptly shut down at the turn of the century by violence on neighboring Ambon, which spilled onto the islands.

Boats are now the most reliable way to get there, the fastest taking six hours from Ambon. But like the flights, they too can be unpredictable.

There are plans to expand the airport, which holds the promise of development. But Alwi and Huhn are afraid an uncontrolled influx of tourists — a feature of modern globalization — could damage the Banda Islands most valuable asset: the environment. A group of Russian spear-fishing tourists were recently run out of town. And illegal Chinese shark finning is threatening a seasonal gathering of hammerheads.

“We have to have a conservation plan,” Alwi said.

Not for the first time, the tiny Banda Islands are trying to navigate the difficult seas of globalization — looking for development without destroying what is special about the islands, and hoping for a little help from Manhattan, that other and much richer island for which they were traded three and half centuries ago."

A team at the National Institutes of Health hopes they can cure, or at least ease, eczema by spraying “good” germs onto the skin of sufferers.

The idea is to restore the skin to its normal, healthy balance.

Most eczema drugs are creams or lotions designed to soothe the inflammation that makes eczema so uncomfortable. aniaostudio / Getty Images

It’s one of the first tests of a treatment aimed at altering the skin’s microbiome — the collection of bacteria, fungi and other microorganisms that live on the skin.

The cost, they hope, will be around $100 or so.

That’s a big contrast to a new eczema drug that is making headlines this week. The Food and Drug Administration just approved Dupixent, a $37,000-a-year injectable drug to help ease the itching, swelling, redness and crusting caused by the most severe cases of eczema.

Related: The New Frontier in Medicine - the Microbiome

“Our hope is that by correcting bacteria on the skin, patients won’t have to do constant treatment,” said Dr. Ian Myles of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, one of the NIH institutes.

The study is one example of many research studies funded by the NIH, whose budget is in the crosshairs of the Trump administration. Some members of Congress have promised to fight President Donald Trump’s proposal to slash the NIH budget by $1.2 billion this year and by a full 20 percent next year.

“Our hope is that by correcting bacteria on the skin, patients won’t have to do constant treatment.”

Most eczema drugs are creams or lotions designed to soothe the inflammation that makes eczema — formally known as atopic dermatitis — so uncomfortable. Dupixent is a monoclonal antibody that alters the immune system response that underlies inflammation.

Dr. Ian Myles and his colleagues are taking a completely different approach. They are building on research that shows people with atopic dermatitis have unhealthy bacteria on their skin.

“Those bacteria are deficient compared to the same bacteria taken from a healthy volunteer,” Myles, who is leading the study, told NBC News.

“We have done some genetic testing that tells us definitively that those bacteria are different.”

Related: White House Backs New Microbiome Project

While people with eczema appear to have mostly the same species of bacteria as people without, the types that Myles’s team tested seemed weaker. He believes that these weak bacteria aren’t doing their jobs and can’t compete with harmful bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus.

Myles and colleagues have been growing bacteria in the lab taken off healthy volunteers and people with atopic dermatitis. They’ve focused on one particular species: Roseomonas mucosa.

Tests on human skin cells in lab dishes and on mice show that healthy versions to R. mucosa can eradicate eczema and make skin cells healthier, Myles said.

“We took the bacteria from healthy people and we saw that the bacteria does everything you would want it to do to improve atopic dermatitis in a petri dish and in mice,” he said.

Related: Gut Germs May Affect Parkinson's

It improved the way skin cells use vitamin D, made the skin cells stronger and helped kill off staph bacteria.

“In mice, we can actually make their disease go away with this bacteria,” Myles said.

Myles and colleagues have purified the healthy Roseomonas bacteria and made it into a spray. They’ll try it first on healthy adults to make sure it’s safe, and then they want to recruit kids 7 and older with atopic dermatitis to try it out.

The phase 1 study is aimed at ensuring the treatment is safe, but Myles hopes to show it's effective, also. If it is, it would be years away from the market because it will have to go through phases of testing and then be licensed to a company to produce it.

They are not the only team trying to use good bacteria to help eczema. Richard Gallo of the University of California, San Diego, and colleagues have been trying a lotion using two benign staph bacteria — Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus epidermidis — to fight the effects of the harmful Staphylococcus aureus.

Related: You Live in Your Own Germ Cloud

“Twenty-four hours later, it was clear—the probiotic lotion reduced levels of the bad bug, Staph aureus, on the participants’ skin,” NIH director Dr. Francis Collins wrote in his blog. The NIH is helping to pay for Gallo’s study.

“Hopefully, the promise of these new findings can provide some encouragement to the more than 31 million Americans, many of them children, who now suffer from eczema,” he added.

The microbiome includes the organisms that live in and on the body. They help digest food, affect appetite, influence disease and may even control mood.

The best known example of using the microbiome to treat disease is the development of poop pills to cure Clostridium difficile infections."
http://www.nbcnews.com/better/business/how-college-students-can-avoid-overdraft-late-fees-ncna774051,nbcnews,How college students (and the rest of us) can avoid overdraft and late fees,[],"Subscribe Let our news meet your inbox. SIGN UP

As if college isn't expensive enough — and at an average $24,610 for a year at an in-state public college and twice that at a private one — today's college students seem intent on adding substantially to their bills. The culprit? Overdraft and late payment fees. Over four years of school, those charges add another $1,016 for the average student, according to NerdWallet. In total, U.S. college students spend more than $795 million a year on overdraft and late payment fees. And every penny of that spending is unnecessary.

So, if you're sending a child off to school this fall here's what they need to know to keep the money in their bank accounts — where it belongs.

Skip Overdraft “Protection”

Overdraft protection can be a misnomer, says millennial money expert Stephanie O’Connell. Essentially, the ""protection"" is assurance that if you pay for something, your purchase will go through even if the money isn't there. But no one is protecting you from overdraft fees. The average bank overdraft fee is currently $35, at credit unions it's a somewhat more reasonable $27.76, according to to a Bankrate.com survey.

To make matters worse, some financial institutions reorder your day’s transactions from highest to lowest amount (rather than in the time order in which you make them), so that if you do overdraw, you may end up paying more than one fee (once for the high charge if it’s more than your balance, then once for each lower charge after that). This can really add up. “If you got charged three overdraft fees in one day, you’re paying $100,” says O’Connell. “What else would you want to do with $100?”

Your Video Begins in: 00:00 00:23 00:00 / 00:00 How to avoid fees, find unclaimed funds: Free Money TODAY 00:03:41

The fix: Don’t sign up for overdraft protection — and if you’ve already got it, call and opt out. “You could buy a $5 sandwich and wind up with a $35 fee for it,” says NerdWallet personal finance columnist Liz Weston. Opting out means that if you do try to buy something your balance doesn’t cover, your debit card will be declined — but a moment of embarrassment at checkout is likely worth the high-fee alternative. One key thing to remember: If you opt out of overdraft protection and have a credit card, it’s important to make certain you have enough in your checking account every month to pay the credit card bill. If you don’t, your payment will be declined, and a late or missed payment can result in higher fees, interest rates and a lasting impact on your credit score. More on that in a minute.

U.S. college students spend more than $795 million a year on overdraft and late payment fees. And every penny of that spending is unnecessary.

Alerts and Auto-Pay Are Your Friend

Visit your financial institution and credit card company websites, and in the settings sections, turn on as many alerts as you can — for low balances, transactions above X amount, purchases made by phone or online and reminders about payment due dates. It’s also a good idea to sign up for daily account balance reminders so you’re never in the dark about how much you have. The NerdWallet analysis we mentioned before studied overdraft fees and late fees, and those late payments can result in fees and a lower credit score over time. Worst of all, they can turn into skipped payments — which could knock 100 points or more off your credit score, taking up to three years to recover, says Weston.

RELATED: Cosigning a Loan? Your Credit Score Will Drop and You’ll Retire Later

The fix: Set up automatic minimum payments from your checking account to your credit card as well as other bills (health club, car insurance, etc.) you pay on a regular basis. For those credit cards, set an amount you're sure will cover the minimum, then when your bill arrives use that as a nudge to go back and adjust the amount you owe. Each month before your payments are due, set a calendar reminder to check your balance to make sure you have enough to cover it.

Remember: It’s vital to try to pay your card off in full every single month, so don’t charge more than you can afford. Try to minimize the urge to charge by thinking about your long-term goals (a.k.a. spring break or that trip you want to take after graduation rather than today's lunch), says Benjamin Keys, assistant professor at The Wharton School. Getting into credit card debt during college, when you likely don't have much of an income, can mean incurring a mountain of interest. Ask yourself before every purchase: Do I need this? Do I really, really want it?

Students Aren't Given a Banking Break

Finally, when you make your choices about where to bank, keep overall costs — including account maintenance fees — to a minimum. There are plenty of free checking accounts available, Weston notes. Yet, she says, ""colleges often steer [students] to options that might not be the best for them.” Step one to combat this? Be aware that just because something is marketed as a student checking account or a student credit card, that doesn’t necessarily make it the best product for your needs. “A trap people fall into is they take the first account they’re given without actually looking at what the fees are, what the fine print is. What are the terms and conditions?” O’Connell adds.

RELATED: Beware Hidden College Costs: Here’s What Financial Aid Doesn’t Cover

The fix: Compare fees at the brick-and-mortar banks on campus. If you're not satisfied, consider an online financial institution, many of which don’t have fees or account minimums. Personal finance blog PT Money lists some of the best options here. The one thing to watch out for? ATM fees. Yes, you can Venmo your friends and swipe for just about everything else, but if you want to grab cash from a machine that doesn't belong to your bank it can cost $2 to $3 a pop. Be realistic about how often you'll do that and factor the likely monthly ATM fees into your decision.

The Takeaway

Never assume anyone has your best interest at heart. Do your own research on checking accounts and credit cards, and don't be afraid to ask about fees and fine print. Set up alerts and reminders for all your accounts, and schedule automatic minimum payments for credit cards (but try your best to manually pay them off in full every month). Opt out of overdraft protection with your financial institution, but every month before your credit card payment rolls around, make sure your balance is enough to cover it.

The classic game, which came to iOS devices last week, has been downloaded a record-breaking 40 million times in its first four days, said Nintendo.

Mario from ""Super Mario Run."" Nintendo

But it seems many people are having fun twiddling their thumbs in the free version of the game, instead of forking over $9.99 for the upgrade.

Related: Is Nintendo's $10 Super Mario Game the New Normal For Gaming?

While the app ranked No. 1 for free downloads in 75 countries, it was No. 1 in revenue in only 23 countries. In Nintendo's home country of Japan, the app struggled to stay in the top five, according to Sensor Tower, an app intelligence firm.

Mobile gaming is big business, generating an estimated $37 billion this year globally, according to market research firm Newzoo. However, at $9.99, Super Mario Run is one of the more expensive offerings in the app store.

That's where scammers — we'll think of them as the evil Bowser in this situation — come in, luring players with the promise of a free leap over the pay wall.

There are more than 341 malicious accounts promising free access to Super Mario Run, according to a report released Thursday by ZeroFOX, a threat intelligence firm.

""No one wants to pay for anything ever if they can get away with it,"" Evan Blair, co-founder and chief business officer at ZeroFOX, told NBC News. ""And, any time there is a pop culture phenomenon, you will find scammers jumping all over it.""

ZeroFOX has identified a number of scams online claiming to give people free access to Super Mario Run's premium features. ZeroFOX

One of the most popular ways is through social media. Scammers have created accounts that appear legitimate and boast thousands of followers.

They'll claim to offer a free download or free coins, which are the game's currency. People are then urged to click a questionable link that redirects them to phishing pages, where they'll be prompted to enter personal information, Blair said.

Another scam involves hijacking popular Super Mario Run hashtags to push another scam, such as the promise of watching the new ""Star Wars"" movie for free.

""There are a lot of legitimate deal sites out there and social media isn’t one of them. If you’re going to look for offers on social, make sure you’re engaged with the official brand accounts,"" Blair said. ""It sounds simplistic but if it seems too good to be true, it probably is."""

Participants and organizers from the group Cosecha acknowledged that their protest put participants at risk. But they said they were following the model of Dreamers, a group who openly said they were undocumented and were successful in getting the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, better known as DACA, authorized under former President Barack Obama in 2012.

The protesters formed a circle in the middle of a downtown Austin, Texas street that runs in front of the Capitol, laying down banners.

Video of the event filmed by a protest participant showed that soon after the protest started, an officer dragged the banners from the street to the sidewalk. Drivers honked as protesters sat in the street. Officers on horseback and state troopers were also nearby.

Fifteen people were arrested, including four who have deportation deferrals under DACA, organizers said.

Organizers of the protest said Texas has become the ""battleground state in the struggle for immigrant rights"" because it leads the country in deportations and recently passed SB4, giving broad power to individual law officers to question people about their citizenship and immigration status. The law takes effect September 1st. They said the protest was not just for so-called Dreamers, young immigrants who arrived or stayed illegally in the country, usually with parents, but was on behalf of all 11 million people without status in the country.

""We took risks and put our bodies on the line to tell the people of this country that we were ‘Undocumented, Unafraid, and Unapologetic,’” Maria Fernanda Cabello, a spokeswoman for Movimiento Cosecha, said in a statement before the protest. “This moment calls for us to be brave again; to create a moral crisis that will change the narrative on immigration in this country.”

Catalina Adorno, 27, of Texas, was among those arrested. She told NBC Latino in an interview before the protest that she recognized she was taking a risk by participating in the sit-in. Adorno has a deportation deferral and permission to work through DACA.

""When I made the decision to participate in the action, I remembered how, for DACA, we only won because we took action. For me, its important to remember that now, in this anti-immigrant climate, we can only win by taking action,"" said Adorno, who is originally from Mexico.

Adorno said she is the only person in her family who qualifies for DACA. She said her parents have been fearful of deportation throughout the Obama administration and now under Trump.

Adorno recently finished graduate school and wants to teach. She said she has grandparents in Mexico, but hadn't come up with a long-term plan for what she would do in Mexico if deported there.

""I know the risk is there, but I want to take the risk because it's not about me, especially under this administration. We have to show we are going to be fighting back, fighting against what this administration wants to put forward against us,"" she said.

While there are not specific details on exactly where $1.6 billion proposed for President Trump's border wall will be spent, an amendment sponsored by Rep. John Carter, R-Texas, calls for $498 million to go to 28 miles of ""new bollard levee wall"" in Hidalgo County in Texas' Rio Grande Valley — home to the National Butterfly Center.

The amendment also calls for $251 million to repair secondary border fencing in the San Diego area and $38.2 million for planning future border wall construction. Another $784 million is for 32 miles of ""border bollard fencing"" in Starr County, Texas, also in the Rio Grande Valley.

The butterfly center’s executive director Marianna Treviño Wright said she found a work crew on the butterfly center’s property last week, and she worried that their efforts might be related to construction of the proposed border wall. The workers had chain saws and work trucks and had cut and shred brush, trees and plants, she said. Treviño Wright said she found surveyor stakes and ""X"" marks on the property. She posted photos on the center’s web site and Facebook page.

The 100-acre center is part of the wildlife corridor of the lower Rio Grande Valley, which is a migratory flyway for birds, butterflies and a host of other wildlife. The center’s property already is bisected by earthen levees. Two thirds of the property is below the levee, Treviño Wright said.

“The property we have acquired here used to be a commercial onion farm and we have spent the last 15 years fundraising for our efforts and growing plants and purchasing materials to revegetate this area, to plant native, host and nectar plants and provide breeding and feeding areas to support wildlife, especially butterflies,” she said.

“We do have folks who come from around the state, nation, world for the birds and butterflies and other things we have here on the property. Sometimes people show up looking for indigo snakes,” Treviño Wright said.

In a previously issued statement, the Army Corps of Engineers denied that its contractors cleared or removed trees at the center, but acknowledged the crew placed X markings on the ground for mapping and wooden stakes flagging proposed locations to bore holes for possible construction. The agency said its contractor collected two soil samples from the levee but did so away from the butterfly center.

Neither U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Army Corps of Engineers, nor other agencies have outlined plans for the proposed border wall on the center property.

A surveyor's stake is seen on the property of the National Butterfly Center in Mission, Texas. National Butterfly Center

Still, Treviño Wright and her supporters worry about what the center called on Facebook the ""government's secret activity on our property.""

There also is angst over the possibility of border wall construction in another refuge along the Rio Grande — the San Ana Wildlife Refuge. It is considered the “crown jewel” of wildlife refuges and one of the nation’s top birding spots. The Texas Observer first reported that crews were taking core samples, setting off a reaction among birders who flock to the spot that boasts 400 species of birds.

The American Birding Association put out a plea to its members to write and call their members of Congress asking that they stop construction of the wall.

Carlos Diaz, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection, told NBC News he did not have information on what plans or hopes there are for putting fencing or a wall on the butterfly center's property or the Santa Ana Refuge.

In a previously issued news release following a meeting with Rio Grande Valley mayors last week, Customs and Border Protection and the Army Corps of Engineers said in a news release they are conducting research activities in areas slated for construction of new or replacement border wall, with $20 million in reprogrammed funds approved by Congress.

Also money provided for fiscal 2017 is being used to replace pedestrian barriers in San Diego and El Centro, California; replace vehicle barriers and pedestrian barriers in El Paso, Texas and install 35 new gates at gaps in border fencing built already in the Rio Grande Valley, according to Army Corps of Engineers information provided by Diaz.

In a hearing Monday held by the U.S. House Rules Committee, Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., pointed out that American taxpayers are footing the tab for the border wall work, not Mexico as Trump had promised. That's a point that should be debated and could be if the border wall funding was given it's own vote, he said.

“This is a rigged process,"" McGovern said.

With Congress closing in on a summer recess, the House is trying to push through a batch of four spending bills the GOP has said are critical for security. But the GOP plan to include $1.6 million for 74 miles of President Donald Trump's border ""wall"" means those who oppose the border wall funding have to vote against the military spending.

Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, who chairs the Rules Committee, said Monday he made the amendment providing the border wall money ""self-executing,"" setting up the dilemma for opponents of the wall funding.

“You are dadgum right I put it in there,” Sessions said.

“We are going to comply with allowing the president to have things he wants also,"" he said.

Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., called the move “sneaky” and said House Speaker Paul Ryan and GOP House members were doing Trump’s “dirty work.”

“They want to make sure Trump can build his wall, but they also want desperately to avoid a clean up or down vote on the issue,” Gallego told reporters in a call Monday.

Ashlee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan, said in an email that House and Senate Republicans' agenda includes a commitment to increased border security ""and we are following through on that promise.""

""When you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon — you just see them thrown in, rough,"" Trump said during a rally in Suffolk County, New York. ""I said, 'Please don't be too nice.'""

""Like when you guys put somebody in the car and you're protecting their head,"" Trump continued. ""The way you put their hand over — like, don't hit their head and they just killed somebody, don't hit their head. I said, 'You can take the hand away, OK?'""

Members of the Suffolk County Police Department attending the event, which was meant to highlight the Trump’s administration efforts to combat gang violence, tepidly applauded behind the president — and the department later issued a statement that it doesn't tolerate abuse of prisoners.

""The SCPD has strict rules & procedures relating to the handling of prisoners,"" the statement said. ""Violations of those rules are treated extremely seriously. As a department, we do not and will not tolerate roughing up of prisoners.""

Trump notably encouraged violence at some rallies during his 2016 presidential campaign. At an event in Iowa he encouraged supporters to “knock the crap” out of anyone they see throwing a tomato. He also offered to pay the legal fees of anyone who assaulted protesters, and at one point said his staff was looking into supporting a man caught on tape sucker-punching a protester at a North Carolina rally."

People who tried out the patch said it was not difficult or painful to use, and tests of their blood suggested the vaccine it delivers created about the same immune response as a regular flu shot, the team reported in the Lancet medical journal.

The hope is the vaccine will be cheaper, easier to give and more acceptable than a regular flu vaccine.

“It was really simple. It’s kind of like a band-aid almost,” said Daisy Bourassa, a college instructor who tested the new vaccine for the study.

“It’s not like a shot at all. If I had to describe it is maybe like pressing down on the hard side of Velcro. It is like a bunch of little teeny tiny stick things that you can feel but it’s not painful.”

The team at Georgia Tech, and a spin-off company called Micron Biomedical, have been working on the patch vaccine for years. This was the first test using real flu vaccine, and the results show it caused immune responses very similar to those elicited by vaccine administered by syringe.

“There were no treatment-related serious adverse events,” Dr. Nadine Rouphael of the Emory University School of Medicine and colleagues wrote in their report.

It was a phase 1 trial, meant mostly to show safety in just 100 volunteers. That’s not enough to show whether the vaccine actually prevented any cases of influenza. That will take a larger trial to demonstrate.

“We haven’t yet met a vaccine we haven’t been able to incorporate into a microneedle device.”

“The results were great,” Rouphael told NBC News. “We were pleased to see that the immune response was excellent.” Rouphael’s team were the experts in vaccinating, and were recruited by the Georgia Tech team to actually test the experimental patch.

The tiny needle-like points on the patch are made out of the vaccine itself. When pressed into the skin, the needles dissolve, delivering the dried vaccine into the outer layer of the skin. This layer is loaded with immune system cells that are the first line of defense against invaders such as bacteria and viruses.

These cells take up the vaccine and use it to prime themselves against a flu infection.

The trial showed that people could use the patch without any help and liked it. It also showed they had an immune response to the patch, and did not have any serious side-effects from using it.

If it continues to work well in tests, Rouphael said it might be possible to just let people buy the vaccine patches and take them home to use.

They’ll be much easier to ship around the country and the world than current vaccines, which must be carefully refrigerated.

Bourassa is a fan of the idea.

“I think it would be fantastic if this was something you could get and administer it yourself at home,” she said.

“The reason why many years I don’t get a shot is that I don’t have time to wait in a line or whatever. It would be really awesome if I could order it and it would be delivered like Amazon Prime.”

Biomolecular engineering professor Mark Prausnitz of Georgia Tech, who leads the team developing the patch vaccines, said the vaccine stayed stable for as long as a year at temperatures up to 100 degrees F. Conditions like that would completely spoil a regular flu vaccine.

“ It would be really awesome if I could order it and it would be delivered like Amazon Prime.”

“It is also really neat how you can keep it at room temperature,” Rouphael said. “It really simplifies the way we do vaccines. This could be a game-changer.”

Prausnitz and colleagues are trying other vaccines in their device, including measles, rubella and polio vaccines. He says he has even tried experimental Ebola and Zika viruses in the delivery patch.

“We haven’t yet met a vaccine we haven’t been able to incorporate into a microneedle device,” Prausnitz said. Another possibility for the microneedle delivery system are drugs that must be injected, as well as insulin, he said.

Rouphael said she had no trouble recruiting volunteers for the trial. They were divided into groups and some got the patch and some got injected vaccines.

“They got so disappointed if they got the regular influenza vaccine. You could see it on their faces,” she said.

“They were into being part of the new vaccine gadget.”

More testing will be needed but Dr. Katja Höschler and Dr. Maria Zambon from Public Health England, who were not involved in the trial, said the prospect of a cheaper, easy-to-ship flu vaccine was exciting.

“Microneedle patches have the potential to become ideal candidates for vaccination programs, not only in poorly resourced settings, but also for individuals who currently prefer not to get vaccinated, potentially even being an attractive vaccine for the pediatric population, “ they wrote in a commentary in the Lancet.

Flu is a major killer. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that between 140,000 and 700,000 people get sick enough from flu every year to need hospital care, and infection kills anywhere from 12,000 to 56,000 people a year, depending on how bad the flu season is.

Flu killed 101 children this past season, the CDC said.

Only about 40 percent of Americans get vaccinated for influenza in an average year, even though the CDC says just about everyone over the age of 6 months needs to get a flu vaccine every year."

The celebrated poet was the first African American to receive the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. In commemoration, award-winning poet and novelist Angela Jackson and Beacon Press have published A Surprised Queenhood in the New Black Sun: The Life & Legacy of Gwendolyn Brooks.

Jackson explores Brooks' life, getting unprecedented access to Brooks' family, her personal papers, and more. Jackson also examines forty-three of Brooks' poems to give better context and explain the deeper meaning behind the works.

Below is an excerpt from A Surprised Queenhood in the New Black Sun: The Life & Legacy of Gwendolyn Brooks.

Cover of ""A Surprised Queenhood in the New Black Sun: The Life & Legacy of Gwendolyn Brooks."" Beacon Press

In her 1972 autobiography, Report from Part One, Gwendolyn Brooks wrote:

I—who have “gone the gamut” from an almost angry rejection of my dark skin by some of my brainwashed brothers and sisters to a surprised queenhood in the new black sun—am qualified to enter at least the kindergarten of new consciousness now. New consciousness and trudge—toward—progress. I have hopes for myself.

Gwendolyn was further along toward her queenhood, and further than in a kindergarten of black consciousness, further than she herself knew. After all, she was a favorite daughter of the Negro community and had achieved the status of an icon when in 1950 she became the first black person to be awarded a Pulitzer Prize.

Throughout the 1950s, she did not travel much and gave a limited number of readings, but by the 1960s, as her daughter, Nora, grew older, Gwendolyn became a regular presenter of her works in Chicago public schools, from Copernicus to Tanner, down the street from her house. She had a special way with children, who loved her expressive style and her ease with them. She was Somebody, and they knew it.

In 1962, she and Langston Hughes were the only Negro poets to read at the National Poetry Festival, sponsored by the Library of Congress. In 1965, the Metropolitan Community Church honored her at a testimonial at the Pick-Congress Hotel, in downtown Chicago.

She was royalty, of a kind.

It was the young black people who had ignited the fires that smoldered in her, the young black poets who had put the light in her eyes. A new world beckoned.

Gwendolyn Brooks Nora Brooks Blakely

Even before the Fisk Writers Conference of April 1967, in February 1966, she had given a reading in Rochester, Michigan, and met another poet who would be important on her path to the new Black Consciousness. Dudley Randall struck her as a gentle man, not at all as she had anticipated from his tough reviews in Negro Digest. “Oh, you’re Dudley Randall. I thought you were terrible, but you’re all right,” he remembered her saying. They had dinner at his house, with his wife, and poets Oliver LaGrone, Joyce Whitsit, and Harold Lawrence. Randall was a longtime admirer of Gwendolyn’s poetry and asked her to contribute to his publishing house.

Related: 14 People Who Broke Barriers to Make Black History

Broadside Press was born when Randall published his own civil rights poem, “Ballad of Birmingham.” He asked Gwendolyn if he might do broadsides of her poems “We Real Cool” and “Martin Luther King Jr.” Soon, Randall and Margaret Burroughs were editing an anthology dedicated to Malcolm X. Gwendolyn sent her legendary poem “Malcolm X” for what would become Malcolm: Poems on the Life and Death of Malcolm, published in May 1967.

In 1968, Don Lee was published through Broadside Press. He had been recommended by Margaret Burroughs after self-publishing Think Black. Broadside Press published Black Pride, then the blockbuster and artistically ground-breaking Don’t Cry, Scream. Lee was satisfied with his publisher and wanted to contribute even more to the development of the black community. He knew that Gwendolyn had reached the point in her political sentiments that she was ready to move from Harper & Row. He influenced her to publish her new work at Broadside Press.

Gwendolyn listened and agreed. But make no mistake about it— she put her work where she professed that it should be. She expressed black unity and fidelity to black economic prosperity and the liberation of black psyches. She believed that she had to build up a black publishing house. It was, she believed, her duty. Lee stressed to her the importance of institution building, of building black schools, publishing houses, and organizations that would live beyond the lifespans of their founders. This business of institution building was central to the thinking of the Black Arts Movement in Chicago which, as it turns out, would prove to be the intellectual center of the movement. Gwendolyn was in the thick of things.

In 1968 and 1969, she and Lee often gave readings together across the country. In the beginning, she would read from her work and then introduce the younger poet to the audience. Lee was a dynamic reader and did not disappoint Gwendolyn’s faith in him. She was acting as a poetic mentor. After a time, Lee became dissatisfied with the order of their readings. He found her reading before him disrespectful of her as the elder, more esteemed poet. He insisted on reading first and presenting her. She was, after all, Gwendolyn Brooks, a kind of mother to a group of younger black poets, particularly Lee and Walter Bradford.

Ann McNeil, now Dr. Ann Smith, met Gwendolyn Brooks at Northeastern Illinois State College in the fall of 1966. They had “cubbies,” cubicles, close to each other. Gwendolyn was teaching in the English Department; she had a title of some distinction—Distinguished Lecturer—but no official trappings, not even an office. Smith was familiar with Gwendolyn, of course, from her writings. As a professor and an actor in the Speech and Theater Department, Smith was well versed in black literature, and Gwendolyn was a key figure. In person, Smith noticed that Gwendolyn was “quiet, unassuming, intentionally shy. She didn’t reach out to be the center of attention, even when she was. She did not seek the limelight.”

As their friendship developed, Smith found Gwendolyn had a sense of humor and that “her conversation was like her poetry. She didn’t waste words. She was self-deprecating and very kind.” Smith remembers Gwendolyn’s deceptive simplicity, even her “simplicity in attire. … People would say that she was stand-offish, but in fact, she was shy.” In truth, Gwendolyn was shy, but she could be stand-offish, too.

When Smith first met Gwendolyn, neither was involved in any black groups. But in 1967, Smith met Hoyt W. Fuller and became involved with OBAC. That same year, Gwendolyn took a different route to become involved with some of the same people. By the spring of 1968, Smith knew Gwendolyn better through her involvement with a special celebration of her work at Northeastern Illinois. At that program, Smith performed Gwendolyn’s poem “the mother,” and Jeff Donaldson, OBAC visual artist and actor, presented her “of DeWitt Williams on his way to Lincoln Cemetery.”

Gwendolyn would list Dr. Smith in her inner circle. This relationship expanded the shy poet’s circle within the Black Arts community. But she had always been a part of Chicago, even if she had always considered herself somewhat of a loner. In May 1965 when it was reported that Chicago had paid homage to Gwendolyn, it was also reported that she had paid homage to Chicago. “Asking me why I like Chicago is like asking me why I like my blood.” She had never been called the poet of Chicago but said it would be a great honor if she was.

Angela Jackson, author of ""A Surprised Queenhood in the New Black Sun: The Life & Legacy of Gwendolyn Brooks."" Betty J. Jackson

By January of 1968, homage to Gwendolyn would be institutionalized statewide when she succeeded Carl Sandburg as the poet laureate of Illinois. Of this appointment, Gwendolyn said, “Being the state’s poet laureate is an honor for which I will receive no pay. … And that’s only fair because right now, I don’t plan to write any poems.”3 But she managed to write beautiful poems as laureate, most notably, “Aurora,” which she wrote in January 1973 for the inauguration of Governor Dan Walker.

We who are weak and wonderful

wicked, bewildered, wistful and wild

are saying direct good morning

through the fever

It is the giant-hour,

Nothing less than gianthood will do;

nothing less than mover, prover,

shover, cover, lever, diver

for giant tacklings, overturning new

organic staring,

that will involve that will involve us

all.

We say direct good-morning

through the fever,

across the brooding obliques, the

somersaults, ashes

across

the importances stylishly killed:

across

the edited bias,

the waffling of woman,

the structured rejection of blackness.

Ready for ways,

windows,

remodeling spirals; closing the hot

clichés

Unwinding the witchcraft.

Opening to sun.

This is the Gwendolyn Brooks of mysterious language as in Annie Allen. She is poet laureate and a bit studied, beautifully.

We love seeing mangoes pop up in the produce aisle during the warmer months. The vibrant cubes sprinkled on top of a salad somehow make our sad Tupperware desk lunch, well, a little less sad.

And the fruit adds a tropical vibe to our fruit bowl — which is usually stocked with the standard orange and banana combo.

But when faced with the task of actually slicing it (and getting to the juicy flesh inside), that banana starts looking a whole lot more appealing.

That’s why we asked chef and author of Kitchen Matters Pamela Salzman to teach us how to cut the fruit without butchering it (or ourselves). Here, she walks us through the steps of slicing a mango into cubes that'll look and taste great sprinkled on a salad or a bowl of yogurt. Here's how to do it.

How to Cut a Mango into Cubes

WHAT TO LOOK FOR: You want to choose a mango that’s heavy for its size. A ripe mango will also give slightly to gentle pressure.

WHAT YOU'LL NEED: A cutting board, a large chef's knife and a ripe mango.

HOW TO CUT IT:

STEP 1: Cut off a little slice from the end of the mango, so that you can sit it upright on the cutting board. This will help stabilize the mango when you’re cutting it (and ensure you keep all of your fingers!)

STEP 2: Slice through the body of the mango, slightly off center so that you avoid the pit. If you hit the pit, simply move the knife slightly further off center and try again.

STEP 3: Cut off the other side the same way, and then shave off the remaining flesh from the pit.

STEP 4: Take one of the cut mango halves in the palm of your hand. Very carefully, using the tip of the chef’s knife, score the mango into a grid without cutting through the skin.

STEP 5: Place your thumbs on either side of the half and pop the mango open, revealing the cubes. You can either push the cubes off with your fingertips, or use the knife to slice them away from the skin.

It's another big setback for the LGBT community, a group that candidate Donald Trump pledged to support when he held up a rainbow flag at 2016 rally in Colorado.

The government's court filing comes in a discrimination lawsuit against a New York skydiving company. One of its instructors, Donald Zarda, said he was fired for being gay.

He claimed the firing violated the Civil Rights Act, which, among other things, bans discrimination ""because of sex."" The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission agreed. ""Discrimination because of sexual orientation cannot rationally be distinguished from discrimination because of sex,"" the EEOC said.

But the Justice Department unexpectedly stepped into that case Wednesday, even though the government was not involved in the dispute, to say the law applies only to discrimination that treats men and women differently.

While there have been ""notable changes in societal and cultural attitudes about discrimination,"" the government said, Congress has consistently declined to amend the law in light of those changes.

The Justice Department's position was consistent with the way most federal appeals courts have ruled on the issue, but it marked a turnaround from the approach taken during the Obama administration.

The Justice Department brief, filed in the Second Circuit Federal Court of Appeals in New York, came the same day the president said transgender people cannot serve in the U.S. military.

""I think the community feels very much under attack and under siege by this administration. In a very real sense, it was the administration's anti-LGBT day,"" said James Esseks of the American Civil Liberties Union.

But some conservative groups welcomed the Justice Department’s action. “Only Congress can amend the federal law, and that diverse body of legislators has rejected several requests to do so. I applaud the DOJ for upholding the rule of law,"" said Mat Staver of Liberty Counsel.

The union has taken the unusual step of directly calling on McKesson Corp. shareholders to turn thumbs down on July 26 to the $1.1 million bonus that was awarded earlier this year to Chief Executive John Hammergren.

McKesson Corp. Chief Executive John Hammergren at an employees event on May 25. Courtesy McKesson Corp.

They say Hammergren, who heads the nation's largest pharmaceutical wholesaler, shouldn't have been rewarded after McKesson paid a record $150 million fine to the federal government this year for violating the Controlled Substances Act by failing to report suspicious orders of oxycodone and hydrocodone pills.

""It is not only a matter of poor optics,"" Ken Hall, general secretary and treasurer of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, wrote in a message to ""fellow"" McKesson shareholders. ""It is staggering that Hammergren received a $1.1 million boost to his bonus just months after the company announced it had reached a $150 million settlement"" with the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Besides the ""record fine by the DEA,"" Hall wrote, ""over the past year, McKesson has faced a rising tide of criticism that it failed to control the supply of prescription opioid in hard-hit states like West Virginia.""

""The company's sales practices have sparked a Congressional investigation by the House Energy and Commerce Committee as well as numerous pending lawsuits from cities and counties across the state,"" Hall wrote.

Michael Pryce-Jones, the Teamsters' senior corporate governance analyst, said it's too late to strip Hammergren of the money, ""but we can send a strong message to the board that it needs to rethink how they are paying their top executives.""

""This is a non-binding vote, and most votes on bonuses like this sail through with 95 percent support,"" Pryce-Jones told NBC News.

Anything less would be considered an embarrassment for Hammergren. ""This would be a vote of no confidence,"" Pryce-Jones said.

In its response, McKesson insisted that the company ""and its shareholders have been well served during John Hammergren's service as both CEO and chairman of the Board.""

""John's in-depth knowledge of the healthcare industry and of the complex businesses and operations of the company allows him to lead the Board's work and focus, ultimately helping deliver long-term value to our investors,"" the company said in a statement.

McKesson and other big pharmaceutical distributors, like AmerisourceBergen Corp. and Cardinal Health Inc., have been accused of fueling the deadly opioid epidemic that has been ravaging the country. Many union members live in some of the states that have been hardest hit by the crisis — Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Michigan.

At the Teamsters convention last summer in Las Vegas, Travis Bornstein, who heads Local 24 in Akron, Ohio, moved many to tears as he described losing his son, Tyler, to drugs. And in April, Hall laid out the union's strategy for go after Hammergren in a harsh editorial.

""Amid the annals of corporate America, this must rank as one of the most tragic failures of corporate integrity — a devastating breakdown in values, culture, ethical conduct and regard for the law,"" he wrote.

There is no love lost between the Teamsters and McKesson. In 2014, a National Labor Relations Board judge ruled that McKesson had violated federal law by plotting to decertify a Teamsters local in Florida.

Bonus or no bonus, Hammergren isn't hurting for money. His base salary this year is $1,680,000, which has remained unchanged since May 2010, according to McKesson's 2017 stockholder report.

But Hammergren's total compensation is $20.1 million, making him one of the best-paid chief executives in the country. And with that kind of money, he could afford to take a bath on the palatial mansion in Orinda, California, that he's been trying to unload.

Hammergren put it on the market last year for $22.5 million, and the accompanying video shows a veritable palace with Ferraris parked in the four-car garage. It's still on the market for $16.5 million.

In a related matter, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Justice Department reached a $35 million settlement with Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals ""for failing to notify the DEA of suspicious drug orders, in large numbers.""

""These failures resulted in millions of oxycontin pills being sold on our streets,"" Session said at the annual convention of Drug Abuse Resistance Education, or D.A.R.E., in Grapevine, Texas.

Mallinckrodt confirmed the settlement in a statement but denied ""government allegations that it violated applicable laws in connection with its suspicious order monitoring program.""

""We chose to resolve the legacy matter in order to eliminate the uncertainty, distraction and expense of litigation and to allow the company to focus on meeting the important needs of its patients and customers,"" Mallinckrodt lawyer Michael-Bryant Hicks said in a statement.

Counterfeit Mallinckrodt oxycodone pills that are actually made from far more dangerous fentanyl have been flooding New England and were blamed for the death of a 30-year-old Hamden, Connecticut man, in March, according to the DEA.

Agustin Cirino, 29, who also lives in Hamden, was arrested a short time later and is the first person in the state to be hit with a federal charge of distributing fentanyl disguised as oxycodone, or Oxycontin, the feds said. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.

""I can confirm it's the first case of its kind that we're prosecuting federally here in Connecticut,"" Tom Carson, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Hartford, told NBC News."

http://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/netflix-s-terrace-house-reality-show-becomes-good-natured-n782736,nbcnews,"On Netflix’s ‘Terrace House,’ the Reality Show Becomes ‘Good-Natured’",['Audrey Cleo Yap'],"What do you get when you put six telegenic strangers in a stylish house and everyone — by reality TV standards — is generally polite to one another? The Japanese-language Netflix series “Terrace House,” a reality show produced by the subscription streaming service and Japan’s Fuji Television. The series has gained an international following, spawning threads on Reddit, building up a fanbase in the U.S., and inspiring informal “Terrace House” tours of locales featured on the show.

Think of it as the anti-”Bachelor.”

“Terrace House” features a rotating cast of three men and three women, ranging in ages from 18 to 29. Its slow pace, lengthy beauty shots of food and scenery, and minimal friction between castmates is a departure from the over-the-top antics typically associated with reality television.

“The intent was not to say the show is uniquely Japanese in style, but rather the fact that, due to differences in cultural traits, we do not really portray any aggressive haggling over relationships or abusive language or violent fights like you often see in reality shows from other countries,” Dai Ota, chief producer of “Terrace House,” told NBC News in an email. “In our series, romance and subtleties in emotion are depicted more organically in an environment where progression is rather slow, and you don’t know whether the two will take a step forward or not.”

Cast members date but usually after engaging in what appears to be a carefully considered courtship, where the most subtle of gestures is dissected by fellow housemates as well as a panel of celebrity commentators that the show cuts to throughout each episode. There’s also the “meta” factor: It’s not uncommon for new episodes to show cast members watching and reacting to old episodes.

Conflicts are hashed out in “family meeting”-style discussions and center on incidents like eating someone’s food without asking or questioning someone’s life plan. Cast members usually set out specific goals they hope to achieve during their time on the show, whether it’s mastering English or launching their own clothing brand.

Originally set in the Shonan region, “Terrace House” first aired in Japan in 2012 and ran for eight seasons, concluding with a movie spin-off. In 2015, producers partnered with Netflix for a new season, “Terrace House: Boys & Girls in the City,” set in central Tokyo, that coincided with the digital service’s launch in Japan.

Its current season, “Terrace House: Aloha State,” is set in Hawaii, and has included Asian-American cast members who are not of Japanese descent (although cast members speak primarily in Japanese on the show). Part four of the season is scheduled for release on Sept. 26.

The show's toned-down appeal has even bewildered some of its former cast members, like Arman Bitaraf who joined the cast of “Boys & Girls in the City” as the show’s only American housemate and spent almost a year in Tokyo.

“For me, I grew up watching ’Jersey Shore‘ and all of those American reality shows. That was more entertaining for me, so when I got on this show, there were, like, no fights,” Bitaraf, 26, told NBC News. “I was kind of wondering how the viewers see this. Was it too boring? Because for my taste in TV shows, it would be kind of boring.”

Bitaraf was born in Japan and spent part of his childhood there before moving to Hawaii. He said he was motivated to join the cast because he wanted to experience living in Japan as an adult. He thinks that part of the show’s appeal abroad is that it exposes viewers to facets of Japanese culture, like when he carried a mikoshi (Shinto shrine) as part of a festival.

That includes dating rituals. For example, new cast members tend to be bombarded with seemingly blunt questions about who their “type is” and what their life goals are, something Bitaraf says is related to gokon or “group dating” in Japan, where men and women in equal numbers will go out together.

“It’s a cultural thing. The way they talk to each other is just trying to get as much information as they can in a short time to get to know each other,” said Bitaraf, a freelance film production coordinator and the owner of a clothing brand.

The exchange can cross over into off-screen life, too, like for former cast member Yusuke Aizawa. Aizawa — a singer, guitarist, and ukulele player who goes by “Eden Kai” professionally — joined the “Aloha State” cast while he was still attending high school. He hadn’t revealed his participation on the show until he started getting funny looks from some of his classmates a few weeks before his graduation.

“I found out that there was a Japanese language teacher playing the show for her class. So, she was using the show to help her students learn Japanese,” Aizawa, 18, told NBC News.

Aizawa, who moved to Oahu four years ago from Tokyo, said he wasn’t a fan of reality shows before signing onto “Terrace House,” an experience he credits with helping him make a major life choice: “I talked it through with my other cast members and decided to focus more on my music career and my passions and share my music around the world instead of going to college.”

“In our series, romance and subtleties in emotion are depicted more organically in an environment where progression is rather slow, and you don’t know whether the two will take a step forward or not.”

Aizawa has since released an album and will be performing at the Fuji Rock Festival at Mt. Fuji, Japan, later this month.

Both “Boys & Girls in the City” and “Aloha State” are available in 190 countries via Netflix. A representative for the Bay Area-based company could not confirm to NBC News if there are future seasons planned.

Netflix does not release viewership numbers to the public, although the digital streamer has been known to cancel original programming swiftly, like it did when it axed five shows earlier this year.

“Terrace House” chief producer Sayaka Matsumoto said that the tame quality of the show is deliberate when producers cast.

“I wonder sometimes if the show could use a really mean person, or someone who could be that antagonist, but ultimately, we basically cast people who are generally good-natured, considering they’re going to be in a shared living situation,” Matsumoto told NBC News via email. “Although, occasionally, we do see some members who show some very surprising true colors after they move into the house.”

But it’s hard to imagine the kind of controversial, alcohol-fueled drama that recently landed ABC’s “Bachelor in Paradise” in hot water unfolding in the ""Terrace House""-branded pool. And fans and cast members alike seem to like it that way.

“I really loved my cast,” said Aizawa. “They really are like another family.”

What if you could ""see"" directly into another person's brain? The ability to read minds, referred to as telepathy, is yet another concept that's abundant in science fiction, but a former Facebook executive says that we could all be capable of at least seeing inside someone else's mind — provided that we're equipped with the right technology.

Mary Lou Jepsen was the head of display technology at Oculus before founding her own startup called Openwater. The company's goal, while ambitious, is in theory quite simple: ""to create a wearable to enable us to see the inner workings of the body and brain at high resolution."" In short, telepathy courtesy of a brain-computer interface (BCI) — a wearable device that works like a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine.

""I don't think this is going to take decades,"" Jepsen said of the tech's development, during an interview with CNBC. ""I think we're talking about less than a decade, probably eight years until telepathy."" Her company plans to make a very limited number of prototypes available to their early access partners by next year.

Human + Machine

Wearable MRI technology could be quite an asset in terms of disease diagnosis and treatment. With just one quick look, a physician could see what's happening inside a person's brain, or elsewhere in the body. Of course, this raises many questions and concerns about privacy, which Jepsen says the company is working on. ""We're trying to make the hat only work if the individual wants it to work, and then filtering out parts that the person wearing it doesn't feel it's appropriate to share,"" she said.

Openwater isn't the only one working to give the human brain machine-like capabilities. In fact, Facebook is also developing a device similar to Jepsen's. BCIs, which already have applications in prosthesis use, could also become a popular means to prepare humankind for future of intelligent machines.

This is what Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has in mind with his mind/machine merging venture, Neuralink. The U.S. Department of Defense's research arm, DARPA, is also working on projects that would combine humans with machines. Another company is Kernel, which has been working on a neuroprosthesis that can make the brain's neural code programmable.

Cybersecurity officials were alerted to the hacking attempt and reportedly notified the lawmakers on Friday. As a safeguard, they immediately blocked Parliament members from remotely accessing emails outside of the secure network in Westminster.

A spokesman for the House of Commons confirmed to NBC News they were continuing to investigate the incident, which appeared to be over.

""Well, we know that there are regular attacks by hackers attempting to get passwords,"" said International Trade Minister Liam Fox. ""We've seen reports in the last few days of even Cabinet Ministers' passwords being for sale online. We know that our public services are attacked, so it's not at all surprising that there should be an attempt to hack into parliamentary emails.""

In a statement, a Parliament spokesperson said officials discovered unauthorized attempts to access Parliament accounts and are now working with the U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre.

""Parliament has robust measures in place to protect all of our accounts and systems, and we are taking the necessary steps to protect and secure our network,"" the spokesperson said Saturday. ""As a precaution we have temporarily restricted remote access to the network. As a result, some Members of Parliament and staff cannot access their email accounts outside of Westminster.""

Chris Rennard, a member of the Liberal Democrat party in the upper House of Lords, asked his constituents to send urgent messages to him by text.

The latest disruption comes more than a month after a massive malware attack struck an estimated 300,000 computers worldwide, including more than 45 public health organizations in Britain.

In that case, the malicious software known as the Wanna Decryptor, or WannaCry, locked the computer systems and files from use unless money was paid to hackers.

Demonstrators are hit by police water cannons as they protest the G-20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany on July 7, 2017.

Anti-globalization activists set dozens of cars ablaze and tried to block national delegations from entering the G-20 as the meeting got underway. Hundreds of officers built moving lines in different parts of Hamburg and used water cannons to force away protesters from streets across the city. Some were physically moved for hundreds of yards from a protest sit-in in front of the first security checkpoint near the summit grounds.

Eisenstein'],"Honda is recalling more than 1 million Accords in the U.S. because a faulty battery sensor may cause a fire in the vehicle’s engine compartment. The action affects Accords produced between 2013 and 2016.

The Japanese automaker noted that four vehicles have reported fires resulting from the defect, but no injuries. The recall covers more than 1.5 million cars worldwide.

The issue stems from a poor seal around the sensor that monitors the battery’s state of charge. If the seal is compromised, substances like road salt or water can short the sensor, potentially leading to a fire.

The recall comes at a tough time for the automaker. It’s still sorting through the ongoing Takata airbag recall, including a recent fatality in the U.S., bringing the total of U.S. deaths related to the airbags to 12.

Additionally, the maker is preparing to introduce the 2018 model of the Accord next week. The timing was intended to allow it to keep up with the debut of the newly redesigned 2018 Toyota Camry — a top competitor.

Honda said it will begin notifying owners by the end of the month; however, it is likely to take quite a while to complete the recall because it needs to produce the replacement parts necessary to complete the repair.

In the meantime, dealers will perform a temporary repair that should hold until the parts for the permanent fix are produced. Honda officials did not say how long that would take.

Owners can check if their car is included in the recall by visiting www.recalls.honda.com or by calling (888) 234-2138."

The three Americans were killed while fighting with the YPG, or People's Defense Units — part of the Syrian Democratic Forces, a coalition of Arab militias that has been a main ally of the U.S.-led coalition opposing ISIS in northern Syria.

The YPG announced Tuesday that David Taylor, 25, a U.S. Marine veteran from Florida, was ""martyred"" on July 16 while fighting ISIS in the Syrian city of Raqqa. Taylor's father confirmed his son's death to The Associated Press.

Taylor, who used the nom de guerre Zafer Quereçox, ""was loved among his comrades,"" the YPG said in a statement. ""He had a big heart and was a very conscientious comrade, and an expert at what he did.""

According to the YPG, Taylor said he joined the group in May ""to fight against ISIS fascism.""

The YPG has also said Nicholas Alan Warden, 29, of Depew, N.Y., near Buffalo, was killed on July 5 in Raqqa. Warden's father, Mark Warden, confirmed his son's death to NBC affiliate WGRZ of Buffalo.

""I didn't like him going to Syria, no,"" Mark Warden said. But he said he wasn't surprised that his son had joined up with the YPG, telling WGRZ that Nicholas Warden had been obsessed with fighting extremism since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

Nicholas Warden served two tours in Afghanistan with the U.S. Army, and when he got out of the military, he signed on with the French Foreign Legion to fight Boko Haram in Africa, his father said. He went to Syria to fight ISIS in February, the YPG said.

""I joined the YPG to fight ISIS because of the terrorist attacks they were doing in Orlando and San Bernardino, in Nice, in Paris,"" Warden, who used the name Rodî Deysie, said in a YPG video.

It's not known how many Americans have joined the Syrian Democratic Forces, but the YPG says many of them are military veterans.

Not, however, Robert Grodt, 28, of Santa Cruz, Calif., who was killed on July 6 in Raqqa, the YPG said. Grodt's mother, Tammy Grodt, confirmed her son's death to NBC Bay Area.

Grodt was an experienced activist who was deeply involved in the Occupy Wall Street movement before he went to work for a nonprofit in Santa Cruz.

In a YPG video clip, Grodt, who used the name Demhat Goldman, said he joined the group ""to help the Kurdish people in their struggle for autonomy"" and to fight ISIS.

Tammy Grodt said she would never be able to fully understand why her son traveled to Syria, but she said she was proud that he died fighting for a cause he believed in.

It's important ""that we do things that are meaningful, that we do things for other people,"" she told NBC Bay Area. ""I think it's important that we help out and speak up and don't tolerate the mistreatment of others.""

The presence of American volunteers with the YPG is complicated both militarily and diplomatically. The government of Turkey, an important NATO ally of the United States, regards the YPG as terrorist group intent on carving out an independent Kurdish state. Turkish forces have killed scores of Kurdish-affiliated fighters in airstrikes over the past year.

At the same time, the U.S. State Department has said the Syrian Democratic Forces, and the YPG in particular, are critical parts of the U.S.-led coalition opposing ISIS in Syria.

""I think we've been clear in acknowledging that it's a very complex battle space in northern Syria,"" Mark Toner, the State Department's deputy spokesman, said in March.

""We have chosen to work with the YPG as a part of the Syrian Democratic Forces, which include Syrian Kurds, Syria Turkmen and Syrian Arabs — a diverse group of ethnicities — in order to go after, destroy ISIS,"" Toner said. ""So we're in common cause in going after ISIS, as is Turkey. Turkey also realizes the threat they face from ISIS."""

According to a new ballot initiative that could soon hit Colorado voters, preserving childhood innocence means taking smartphones out of the hands of kids.

Denver-area father of five Tim Farnum says he drafted the Preservation of Natural Childhood initiative after watching his two youngest sons (ages 11 and 13) act like addicts in withdrawal when he tried to limit their smartphone time.

In an interview with the Washington Post, Farnum, a local anesthesiologist, compared the impact of smartphones on kids to tobacco and alcohol.

""We have age restrictions on all those things because they’re harmful to kids,"" Farnum told the Post. ""This is no different, in my opinion.""

After looking at research on children and screen time, Farnum was concerned enough to launch the group PAUS: Parents Against Underage Smartphones. On its website, a statement says the group is comprised of ""parents, grandparents and concerned citizens standing together arm in arm against the destructive force of continuous internet use on our children.""

The Colorado group's next meeting is June 24 at the Englewood Recreation Center in the suburbs of the mile-high city. Its ballot initiative aims to ban the sale of touchscreen phones to kids under 13 — and make retailers ask adults whether a new phone is being purchased for a child.

NBC News requested comment from Farnum but did not receive an immediate response.

The effort has received mixed reviews in the Rocky Mountain state, where some parents support limiting screen time for kids while others say the government shouldn't be in control of who gets to use a communications device.

While the Colorado legislature gave an initial green light to the PAUS effort, the group still has to hit the streets to collect 100,000 in-person signatures to get the initiative on the ballot.

For Dr. David Hill, chair of the Communications and Media Executive Committee at the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the group's fight against child smartphone use is ""well meaning,"" but the evidence showing that phones cause developmental problems is not quite there yet.

""There is a correlation between unhealthy behaviors and extensive electronic media use, but it’s not clear what the cause is,"" said Hill. ""While kids with depression and anxiety may use social media or electronics excessively, it’s not clear which comes first.""

In November 2016, AAP released a report titled Media and Young Minds, which suggested that parents should limit screen time for kids aged 5 and under due to ""multiple developmental and health concerns"" associated with excessive media consumption.

But Hill said that while frequent anecdotes come in from distraught parents, more research is needed to show what exactly is causing the problems faced by modern kids.

""We do hear stories about kids who display addictive type behavior around cell phones,"" said Hill. ""The devices provide a dopamine boost, and anything that gives you that some people are going to use to the exclusion of healthier activities.""

""That said, the psychiatric establishment has not decided that there is such a thing as cell phone addiction,"" Hill said, noting that the creators of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) have called for further study into the possible risks of smartphone addiction.

And Yalda T. Uhls, a professor at UCLA's Children's Digital Media Center, said that while kids can be vulnerable to misuse of technology because they are still developing self-regulation and social skills, the Colorado initiative may be overdoing it in terms of regulation.

""Parents, who know their kids best, may have good reasons to provide their child a phone,"" said Uhls, giving one example: ""Low income families or single parents may need the phones to connect with their child — some of whom need to take public transportation to school or can't be supervised in the same manner as parents with more means.""

Both experts agreed that parents should take an active role in both purchasing and monitoring so that kids learn to use their smartphones in a healthy, responsible manner instead of being glued to a screen."

It issued a reminder this week that swapping out artery-clogging saturated fats such as butter with healthy vegetable fats can do as much good for some people as taking a statin drug.

A car makes its way on a road through flowering canola fields on a serpentine section of the L401 highway near Nienstedt, Germany on May 12, 2016. Julian Stratenschulte / dpa via AP

“Scientific studies that lowered intake of saturated fat and replaced it with polyunsaturated vegetable oil reduced cardiovascular disease by approximately 30 percent; similar to cholesterol-lowering drugs, known as statins,” the organization said in a ""presidential advisory.""

These experts stress the word “replace.” That means not just cutting the bad fats — it also means adding the “good” fats, such as corn, soybean and peanut oil.

One reminder that may surprise some people — coconut oil may come from a tree, but it’s not a particularly healthful fat.

“Several studies found that coconut oil — which is predominantly saturated fat and widely touted as healthy — raised LDL cholesterol the same way as other saturated fats found in butter, beef fat and palm oil,” said the American Heart Association advisory, which published in the journal Circulation.

Related: These 10 Foods Affect Your Risk of Heart Disease the Most

Another possible surprise: All fats are a mix of saturated, polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats. The Heart Association said polyunsaturated fats appear to lower the risk of heart disease the most, followed by monounsaturated fats. Saturated fats are the least desirable.

The advisory also lists which fats are healthier:

Safflower oil: 75 percent polyunsaturated fat

Sunflower oil: 66 percent polyunsaturated fat

Canola oil: 63 percent monounsaturated/ 28 percent polyunsaturated fat

Corn oil: 55 percent polyunsaturated fat/ 28 percent monounsaturated fat

Olive oil: 73 percent monounsaturated fat

Peanut oil: 46 percent monounsaturated fat/ 32 percent polyunsaturated fat

Butter: 63 percent saturated fat/ 26 percent monounsaturated fat

Coconut oil: 82 percent saturated fat

Lard: 39 percent saturated fat/45 percent monounsaturated fat

Palm oil: 82 percent saturated fat/ 11 percent monounsaturated fat

Heart disease is the No. 1 killer in the U.S. and in most industrialized countries. “Nearly 808,000 people in the United States died of heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases in 2014, translating to about one of every three deaths,” the Heart Association said.

The Heart Association and American College of Cardiology advise anyone with questionable cholesterol readings to get saturated fat down to just 5 percent of total calories.

Related: Heart attacks, strokes fell after trans-fat ban

“We want to set the record straight on why well-conducted scientific research overwhelmingly supports limiting saturated fat in the diet to prevent diseases of the heart and blood vessels,” said Dr. Frank Sacks, lead author of the advisory and professor of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

“Saturated fat increases LDL — bad cholesterol — which is a major cause of artery-clogging plaque and cardiovascular disease.”

Saturated fats are found in meat, full-fat dairy products and tropical oils such as coconut, palm and others.

“A healthy diet doesn’t just limit certain unfavorable nutrients, such as saturated fats, that can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and other blood vessel diseases. It should also focus on healthy foods rich in nutrients that can help reduce disease risk, like poly- and mono-unsaturated vegetable oils, nuts, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish and others,” Sacks said."
http://www.nbcnews.com/better/better/i-tried-become-morning-person-what-happened-n769391,nbcnews,I Tried to Become a Morning Person and This Is What Happened,[],"Sunrise (n): Something I have seen only after staying up all night.

Subscribe Let our news meet your inbox. SIGN UP

It starts with an idle question for my husband: “Should I try to become a morning person?”

“Do I have to live with you?” he asks. “Or can I get a hotel room?”

For most of my life, I woke up to at least two alarms — one next to my bed and another across the room to make snoozing more difficult. I would walk back and forth between them, hitting snooze on each, for an hour or more. Anyone I ever lived with, and many I didn’t, became my wake up caller, checking on me for important events.

Children will change that for you. I haven’t set an alarm in six years thanks to my early rising sons. They wake up sometime around 6 am (or 5 during particularly brutal times) and that’s that. But have I become the morning ray of sunshine who says “Good morning, children! Let’s go play Legos?” I have not.

Sometimes I pretend I’m still sleeping and pray my husband will get them. Sometimes I go to them and zone out while they play, present but inert. Sometimes I go lie under my 6-year-old’s covers, waiting for full consciousness or a chance to sleep, whichever arrives first.

This is not something I love about myself. And though I am expert at implementing bedtime rules and routines for my children, somehow I fail when I try it myself. Daytime me says “Go to bed earlier! Try exercising in the morning!” But when the time comes, inevitably nighttime me says “Oooh, there’s something to read on the internet!” And when I wake up, morning me says, forcefully: “Go back to sleep.”

The internet is full of advice about how to become a morning person, and at this point I may have read all of it: Have a healthy breakfast. Work out in the morning, and lay out all your gym clothes the night before. Drink a glass of water, perhaps with lemon. Start a gratitude journal. Meditate.

I’ve also read the counter-arguments — that changing your natural body rhythms is neither possible nor desirable. Some people will wake up at 4:30 to get something accomplished. Others would rather stay up that late to do the same thing, and that’s OK.

Change is possible, especially if there’s an external factor like early rising children or pets, and if I’m “militant” about my routine. Change is possible, especially if there’s an external factor like early rising children or pets, and if I’m “militant” about my routine.

And yet like most people, I live with constraints: children, an office job and a life in a morning-centric world. So I start by talking to Dr. Dianne Augelli of Weill-Cornell’s Center for Sleep Medicine to find out if it’s even possible to change. She tells me that as someone who goes to bed around 11, I have what she would call “mild delayed sleep phase.”

“Will you be excited to get up in the morning and wake up and want to start your day and be productive in the morning?” she asks. “That may not happen for you.” But change is possible, especially if there’s an external factor like early rising children or pets, and if I’m “militant” about my routine. She lays out a four-step plan:

1. Take melatonin two hours before bed.

Melatonin isn’t a sedative but a hormone that the body naturally secretes to signal that it’s nighttime. Taking it two hours before bedtime can “help synch up your circadian clock and this bedtime you want to have,” Augelli tells me.

Taking melatonin can help kick-start a change in your circadian rhythm.

She recommends taking the pills for a short time to jump-start the process, starting with a low dose of .3 mg and going up as needed to 1-3 mg. (Anyone with a family history of melatonin shouldn’t take it for long.)

I can do that! I plunk down $8.99 for a bottle of supplements and start that night.

2. Eliminate “blue light” before bed.

Looking at a smartphone or computer in the evening means we’re inundated with sleep-inhibiting “blue light” before bed. And bad news: Night owls are even more sensitive to this stimulating blue light, since it’s encouraging our natural tendencies.

So Augelli suggests cutting off exposure to blue light from phones and computers entirely an hour or two before bed. (TV, she says, is less of a problem because it’s generally farther away.)

This is a little harder. Part of the way I’ve established some work/life balance is by tuning out work during my kids’ bedtime, then logging back in after they go to sleep.

But in truth, my phone checks have become more compulsive than required — I keep thinking I need to check, but find nothing in need of urgent response. And sometimes my checks even backfire because I read something and think I’ll respond in the morning, but often forget because (as you may have noted) I’m not the sharpest in the morning and an already read email doesn’t get my attention.

That first night, I stop myself from checking my phone but feel twitchy. My husband mocks me: “Oh no! Someone said something snarky on Instagram and you’re missing it!” I snap, a little too quickly, “Instagram is earnest! Twitter is snarky.” And, chastened, pick up a book.

The next morning, I wake up to 42 emails. But not one needed to be seen the night before.

3. Get out in the sun soon after waking.

Here’s where it gets really difficult. Augelli recommends 30-45 minutes of sun exposure within an hour or two of waking.

My usual work routine involves a quick walk to the subway, then staying underground for about 30 minutes, then walking through more underground tunnels into my midtown office building. Until recently, I worked in a windowless office, stayed inside for lunch and wouldn’t see the sun again until I emerged out of the subway after work, often when the sun was down. (This explains my Vitamin D deficiency.)

Clearly, this was not ideal. But with the sun rising around 6:45, would it be possible to get some sunlight and still make it to work on time? I decide to put it to the test with a sunrise jog, which I feel should earn me some kind of extra credit in non-morning person karma. I rise at 6:15, get the children dressed, settle the 2-year-old with some puzzles and the 6-year-old with a “Carpool Karaoke” video and leave my husband to handle breakfast. My children are confused. “No like shoes,” the little one says, pointing to my sneakers.

With the sun just coming up, the air is gray, my body is achy and in my rush to leave the house, I have not put in contacts and see the world as a blur. I feel very much as though I would prefer to be sleeping. I know my usual run would take an hour, and my husband might actually kill me if I leave him that long with the children before work, so I do a shortened route.

I put on my most inspirational running music. It takes me about 10 minutes to really wake up and start to enjoy it. The sky gets a smidge lighter as I watch the yellow glow rise over the trees. I am home in 40 minutes feeling more alert than usual, having accomplished my exercise goals and half my water goals for the day before even finishing my coffee. Everyone is fed and my husband doesn’t appear to want to murder me, though without my contacts I can’t actually see him.

This is why morning people feel smug.

I vow to keep up this routine, but buy a “happy light” on Amazon, just in case. (Augelli also suggests wearable devices such as the Re-Timer or Luminette.)

4. Stick to a regular schedule.

This one’s the real rub. On weekends, I am desperate to sleep in or take a nap. As a working mom, it’s one of my few moments of real rest. That’s hard to give up.

On my first day off work, my children wake up extra early at 5:20. And it’s raining, so that morning sun routine isn’t going to happen. I’m not fully alert until around 9 a.m., nursing my second cup of coffee and reading “Rosie Revere, Engineer” to my 2-year-old in the glare of the happy light. I realize that I have already spent about a quarter of my waking hours in a haze.

The next day, the sun is back and in the hours I would have normally slept, I manage a longer run and finish the week’s grocery shopping.

But as the days pass, this morning routine feels like more of a slog. I don’t feel so much as though I’ve become a morning person as I feel I’m using a massive amount of will to force myself through my paces.

On the eighth day, I wake up before my children. But I return from my run to find my husband irritated. The toddler’s got a cold and is screaming for tissues. The house is a mess. And I realize that disappearing for a run for 45 minutes isn’t much better on the good mom/wife scale than sleeping in — except now I’m doing it almost every day.

Can the Slog Become a Habit?

I turn to Gretchen Rubin, author of “Better Than Before” and a forthcoming book about changing habits, for some help. Instead of bucking me up with ways to make this morning run a habit, she tells me I’m making this too tough on myself. Since waking up is itself a challenge, she thinks expecting myself to exercise, too, is setting myself up for failure.

Rubin has mapped out “four tendencies” for people who want to change, and I’m what she calls an obliger — someone who has an easy time making changes for someone else (a boss, my children) but a tougher time following through on my own resolutions. She suggests some options that could help me: finding a wake-up buddy to check in with, tracking my progress and — this is diabolical — setting a consequence that would punish someone else, like my husband. (No dessert for him if I oversleep, for example.)

She also suggests some personal mantras when I’m feeling reluctant:

""I'm modeling good behavior for my children: showing them that I can stick to my commitments, and that exercise is an important part of life, and worth making an effort to incorporate.""

""This is an important time for my husband and kids every day. It's different when I'm around. I want to make space for them to have their own relationships with each other, their own routines, inside jokes, patterns of behavior.""

""If I exercise, I'll be a better parent and wife. I'll be healthier, I'll handle anger better, I'll have more energy. This time will help me do a better job during all the other parts of the day.""

I stick with the exercise routine and turn to the mantras. I also modify things a bit, reducing the number of days I’m running and sometimes taking the 2-year-old with me in the jogging stroller to make things easier on my husband. I even try taking my 6-year-old with me to the park for a morning “boot camp.”

And as the days pass, I realize: I like this. I want to keep running in the mornings. When I miss a few days, I feel especially fuzzy-headed and wonder: How did I function like this in the mornings at work and in school for decades?

So, Am I a Morning Person?

After more than two months of following this routine, am I a morning person? The answer is … drumroll please… kind of?

I do not wake up cheerfully to the sounds of birds chirping. I have no desire to set my alarm to wake up earlier than my children and get things done. My most productive time is still in the afternoon. So I am not what you’d normally think of as a “morning person.”

But have I changed? Absolutely. And here are some secrets I’ve learned:

Night Owls Can Exercise in the Morning and Like It

I never thought I could work out in the morning. I was so tired and groggy. The fact that other people enjoyed morning workouts mystified me. I just figured we were wired differently. And science suggests we are. But this experiment showed me that mornings might actually be the perfect time to work out if you’re not a morning person.

First, there’s the brain boost. I felt more alert in the mornings after running, and it clearly kick-started my metabolism, because I was also eating much more at my desk. (Another issue.)

Running in the morning means being able to get more work done later when I'm most alert. NBC News

But more important, I think, was that running when I wasn’t alert meant I had fewer competing priorities to excuse myself from doing it. If you plan to exercise when you feel motivated and alert, you’ll be using your motivated and alert time to work out instead of accomplishing the 80 other things you want to accomplish during your motivated and alert time.

For me, finishing work always took precedence over workouts. Now that my workouts are discretely tucked away in a time of day when I wouldn’t otherwise be accomplishing much, I am much better about actually doing them. I haven’t been so consistent about working out in years, and that feels great.

You Have More Time Than You Think

Adding a workout into my schedule in the morning wasn’t as difficult as I’d imagined. Although our mornings had always felt rushed, I realized my husband and I were often fumbling through inefficiently, both trying to do the same thing. Leaving for 40 minutes didn’t bring the house tumbling down. Making other accommodations for my husband kept him from resenting me too much.

And as it turns out, cutting off email an hour before bed changed absolutely nothing for me at work, although I did get a sideways “must be nice” from my boss when I explained my doctor-prescribed limit.

I have loosened up on nighttime screens recently, and the blue light before bed has crept back in. I’m using Night Shift for iPhone to filter out some of the blue light — f.lux for computers does the same. Augelli says those programs help somewhat, just not as much as actually turning the thing off.

The Power of Just Doing It

My 2-year-old is deep in his “I did it!” phase. As he becomes more independent — opening a door by himself, or snapping together a Lego tower — he’ll turn to me with a smile and say proudly, “I did it!”

I am an overthinker by nature, and had almost forgotten the power of that simple sense of accomplishment for myself. Forcing myself past the “but I don’t wanna” — I don’t wanna get out of bed! I don’t wanna run in the rain! — worked those muscles and made me feel that simple, satisfying sense of “I did it!” And the less I think about it, the easier it is.

My new mornings: Time to cast shadows instead of hiding in them. NBC News

That’s a lesson I hope sticks, even if my morning routine doesn’t. I don’t want to become my own drill sergeant, but it can be easy to cut yourself a break because you’re tired or busy, when you might feel better following through on your goals.

My Personal Wake-Up Call

My 6-year-old was brainstorming Mother’s Day gifts when he dropped this on me: “Let’s see. Mommy likes to cook, mommy likes snuggling, mommy likes ... lying down.”

Biology is powerful, and for me that includes a pull to lie down more than I’d like. I don’t think I could have become a morning person at any other time in my life. In college, I really did get more done at 2 a.m. than I could have if I’d woken up early to study or finish a paper. In my 20s, I didn’t have to take “disco naps” to have fun with friends at bars.

I also couldn’t pull this off now if it weren’t for sane working hours and a supportive husband who makes breakfast and lunch for our children. (Yes, that’s possible.)

But right now, I can do this. I ask my husband how he thinks it went.

“You are still not a morning person,” he says, “but you have stunningly and to great effect fought your inner nature. I say it’s a draw.”

My hope is that by next Mother’s Day, my son will have a new list: “Mommy likes to cook, mommy likes to run ... mommy likes to wake up and play with me.”

But maybe just for Mother's Day, I'll take a nap."

If recent comments by Ravens coach John Harbaugh regarding the potential signing of quarterback Colin Kaepernick were meant to be a trial balloon, it apparently is made of lead.

Mike Silver of NFL Media reports that the Ravens “have heard from numerous fans regarding Kaepernick in the last couple of days, many staunchly opposed to his signing.”

It’s hardly a surprise, given that Giants co-owner John Mara already has provided all anti-Kaepernick fans with the blueprint for shouting down a potential Kaepernick signing.

“All my years being in the league, I never received more emotional mail from people than I did about that issue,” Mara said in May. “If any of your players ever do that, we are never coming to another Giants game. It wasn’t one or two letters. It was a lot. It’s an emotional, emotional issue for a lot of people, moreso than any other issue I’ve run into.”

It’s impossible to know whether the fans from whom the Ravens have heard are only Ravens fans, or whether they are fans of other teams who simply want to see Kaepernick remain unemployed. Regardless, it’s no surprise that those who don’t want to see Kaepernick on an NFL team are trying to block it from happening at a time when it appears that it could.

Maybe those who support the employment of Kaepernick — you know, those who made his 49ers jersey the 17th highest-selling jersey in May — should start contacting the Ravens as well, regardless of whether they are Ravens fans.

Ultimately, the question becomes whether Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti will ignore the noise, positive and/or negative, and make a decision based solely on the objective of winning football games. After all, that’s what the Commissioner claims all teams do."

From sports stadiums and fashion shows to medical offices and retail stores, scent marketing is being used to tap into customers’ emotions on a deeper level in hopes of enhancing the overall experience.

ScentAir was at the forefront of the scent marketing movement that emerged in the 1990s. Today, ScentAir remains an industry leader. The company is known for its scent delivery systems, a library of over 2,400 smells, and 5 billion scent impressions a year.

ScentAir was on the forefront of the scent marketing movement in the 1990s.

“There are all kinds of things that can happen when you smell an amazing scent,” said Burke — and science supports his sentiments.

In 1993, researchers found that scent marketing campaigns were powerful enough to increase brand loyalty and sales. One of the most well-known studies in the industry was conducted by Alan Hirsch, a Chicago-based neurologist who founded the Smell and Taste Research Foundation.

For the study, scientists placed two identical pairs of Nike running shoes into rooms that were exactly alike, except for one difference. One room had a floral scent, while the other one was unscented.

After the study, Hirsch and his team concluded that consumers were 84 percent more likely to buy the Nike running shoes in the scented room.

Scent marketing use has exploded throughout the globe, and is currently a $200 million industry.

The hospitality industry is especially known for embracing the power of scent. Guests can sniff out signature blends throughout hotel properties. Many times, the custom scents are used throughout product lines, allowing visitors to take part of the brand home with them.

ScentAir plans to help meet the growing demand for scent marketing. The creative company adds approximately 600-800 new customers a month and ships over 2,000 packages a day.

“When we think about who our addressable market is, it's any business that places a premium on their experience, said Burke. “While what we do has a sense of magic to it, it's really about driving the financial objective for the businesses we serve.”"

Embed Senate Health Care Bill: Five GOP Senators Say They Don't Support 1:47 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog

Here are five reasons so many medical professionals oppose the Republican-proposed changes made so far to the 2010 Affordable Care Act:

Women

Medicaid covers half the births in the U.S. right now and the House and Senate bills would both not only pull back the expansion of Medicaid that underlay Obamacare, but reduce federal funding for the original program, too.

“Medicaid coverage for up to 6.5 million women of childbearing age will be rescinded, making it harder for them to get healthy before they get pregnant,” March of Dimes president Stacey Stewart said.

“BCRA discriminates against providers of women’s health services,"" said Dr. Jack Ende, president of the American College of Physicians.

The bill cuts funding to women’s health clinics that provide ""contraception, preventive health screenings, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, vaccines, counseling, rehabilitation, and referrals,"" Ende said.

Children

Medicaid covers 75 million people, including nearly 36 million children, according to data released Friday by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services..

“Senate leaders present their bill as providing states with flexibility. The reality is that it will put considerable pressure on states to limit their spending on health care, including for children,"" said Dr. Matthew Davis, a professor of pediatrics and of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.

“The bill includes misleading ‘protections’ for children by proposing to exempt them from certain Medicaid cuts,” added Dr. Fernando Stein, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.

""A ‘carve-out’ for children with ‘medically complex’ health issues does little to protect their coverage when the base program providing the coverage is stripped of its funding. Doing so forces states to chip away coverage in other ways, by not covering children living in poverty who do not have complex health conditions, or by scaling back the benefits that children and their families depend on,” Stein added.

“Medicaid allows a college student with cerebral palsy to live independently. Medicaid pays for a toddler’s wheelchair, and as she grows over time, it covers the next one and the one after that.”

The number of poor adults without Medicaid will grow dramatically under the Senate bill as federal funding for the expansion is phased out. — Larry Levitt (@larry_levitt) June 23, 2017

The poor

Medicaid is traditionally the state-federal health plan for the low-income, disabled, and children and cutting it will have repercussions across the health care system as people either wait until they’re at death’s door to get treatment, or head to emergency rooms that by law must save their lives, health policy experts stress. The costs get passed on to taxpayers and people with health insurance.

“Medicaid is there for families struggling from the opioid epidemic, covering treatment for parents and services for their children. Medicaid covers a grandmother’s chemotherapy and a newborn baby’s emergency heart surgery and a six-year-old’s hearing screening and a teenager’s asthma inhaler,” Stein said.

""The Senate proposal would likely trigger deep cuts to the Medicaid program that covers millions of Americans with chronic conditions such as cancer, along with the elderly and individuals with disabilities who need long-term services and support. Medicaid cuts of this magnitude are unsustainable and will increase costs to individuals with private insurance,"" added Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the American Hospital Association.

But Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana says the bills may end up helping people get medical care more easily. ""When folks who are on Medicaid – typically there’s only some doctors that see Medicaid patients,"" Cassidy said on MSNBC's Morning Joe program.

""When they're on private insurance, there’s far – there’s a far broader panel of folks to see. And so if, as we move people to private insurance, they have greater access to doctors, to specialists. That could be a positive thing.""

The sick and disabled

“Americans with pre-existing conditions will likewise suffer under this proposal because it would give states the ability to discriminate against the sick by obtaining waivers for essential benefits,"" said the Heart Association’s Brown.

“States can then create their own essential benefits packages which could exclude prevention benefits, rehabilitation and rehabilitation services — all critical for people with cardiovascular disease.”

States may feel pressured to let health insurers cut back on what conditions they will cover. That could mean cheaper premiums, and create the illusion of more choice, but health policy experts say it will mean bare-bones policies in many states that cover very little.

“This bill creates a false narrative that says it will help people with pre-existing conditions, but instead it allows states to waive essential health benefits such as vital prescription drugs, mental and behavioral health services, and preventive services,” said Paul Kawata, executive director of the HIV advocacy group NMAC.

“The bill includes misleading ‘protections’ for children.”

The elderly

Medicaid also covers two-thirds of people in nursing homes. The health care bills in the House and Senate would also let companies charge older people more for insurance than they would younger customers.

“We are disappointed that the legislation fails to meet our guiding principles for healthcare reform by halting Medicaid expansion, reinstating annual and lifetime coverage caps, and cutting coverage for essential health benefits including cancer screening,” said Dr. Bruce Johnson, president of the American Society for Clinical Oncology.

“We are concerned that no public hearings were held and no physician or patient expertise was sought during the bill's development,” the American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Physicians, American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Osteopathic Association and American Psychiatric Association said in a joint statement.

“The American Health Care Act, as passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in May, is an inherently flawed bill that would do great harm to our patients. The Senate's Better Care Reconciliation Act would also leave patients drastically worse off than current law,"" the statement said."

Results of the peer-reviewed study are expected to be published soon in a scientific journal, according to OHSU spokesman Eric Robinson.

The research, led by Shoukhrat Mitalipov, head of OHSU's Center for Embryonic Cell and Gene Therapy, involves a technology known as CRISPR that has opened up new frontiers in genetic medicine because of its ability to modify genes quickly and efficiently.

CRISPR works as a type of molecular scissors that can selectively trim away unwanted parts of the genome, and replace it with new stretches of DNA.

Scientists in China have published similar studies with mixed results.

In December 2015, scientists and ethicists at an international meeting held at the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in Washington said it would be ""irresponsible"" to use gene editing technology in human embryos for therapeutic purposes, such as to correct genetic diseases, until safety and efficacy issues are resolved.

Further east, reinforcements were sent in to battle a blaze in Artigues that burned up to 4,200 acres of forested land.

Gonorrhea, known commonly as ""the clap"" or ""the drip,"" is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases there is. Anyone who is sexually active is at risk and any kind of sex, including anal and oral sex, can pass it along.

It was once easily treated with a quick dose of antibiotics. But, like all bacterial infections, strains have evolved that can evade the mechanisms used by antibiotics and now WHO says they are becoming increasingly common.

“The bacteria that cause gonorrhea are particularly smart. Every time we use a new class of antibiotics to treat the infection, the bacteria evolve to resist them,” said WHO’s Dr. Teodora Wi.

Penicillin was the original, simple cure. Now, WHO reports, 97 percent of countries report gonorrhea that resists ciprofloxacin, 81 percent have found cases that resist azithromycin and two-thirds of countries have found strains that resist the last-resort drugs: extended-spectrum cephalosporins such as oral cefixime or injectable ceftriaxone.

Related: New Drug-resistant Gonorrhea Shows Up in Hawaii

“These cases may just be the tip of the iceberg, since systems to diagnose and report untreatable infections are lacking in lower-income countries where gonorrhea is actually more common,” Wi said.

And a few cases have been reported that were almost completely untreatable

“To date, three extensively drug-resistant gonococcal strains with high-level resistance to ceftriaxone (‘superbugs’) have also been reported — in France, Japan, and Spain,” Wi and colleagues wrote in their report.

There are several reasons it’s spreading. “Decreasing condom use, increased urbanization and travel, poor infection detection rates, and inadequate or failed treatment all contribute to this increase,” WHO said in a statement.

Now the treatment guidelines call for a double-dose treatment for all gonorrhea: an injection of ceftriaxone and azithromycin pills.

The WHO report urges countries to encourage the development of new drugs and a vaccine against gonorrhea and urges better surveillance and treatment in the meantime.

“The development of new antibiotics is not very attractive for commercial pharmaceutical companies. Treatments are taken only for short periods of time (unlike medicines for chronic diseases) and they become less effective as resistance develops, meaning that the supply of new drugs constantly needs to be replenished,” WHO said.

Gonorrhea is not deadly, but it can have serious health effects. It also often spreads silently.

It rarely causes immediate symptoms in women, and often none in men, even as it does damage that can ruin fertility.

The CDC estimates 800,000 new gonorrhea infections occur every year in the U.S. and having it once doesn’t protect you — people can catch it again and again. Globally, WHO estimates 78 million people are infected with gonorrhea every year.

Gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported infectious disease, after chlamydia.

According to the CDC, symptoms in men include:

A burning sensation when urinating

A white, yellow, or green discharge from the penis

Painful or swollen testicles

Most women with gonorrhea do not have any symptoms. But they can include:

Painful or burning sensation when urinating

Increased vaginal discharge

Vaginal bleeding between periods

“You can get gonorrhea by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has gonorrhea. A pregnant woman with gonorrhea can give the infection to her baby during childbirth,” CDC cautions."

And that school board member, Debbie Walsh, said she was bracing for blowback for casting that no vote.

""But blowback is not what I've received,"" Walsh told NBC News on Wednesday. ""The people who talked to me said they agreed with me. They, too, are worried that having it on hand might be creating an even bigger problem by sending the message to kids: 'Don't worry, take drugs. We've got Narcan to save you.'""

While public policy experts and organizations like the National Association of School Nurses beg to differ, Walsh is not the first public official in Ohio to publicly oppose a policy that appears to be gaining widespread acceptance elsewhere in the state.

In recent weeks, the sheriff of Butler County announced that he would not equip his deputies with Narcan (a brand name for naloxone), and a City Council member in Middletown asked his legal department to look into whether authorities are legally required to dispatch ambulances to rescue drug addicts who repeatedly overdose.

Both cited the rising cost to taxpayers as part of their reasoning — and both are Republicans.

Walsh, who is also a Republican, said, ""I got positive responses from both sides of the aisle.""

""Politics wasn't my driving force, and neither was the cost,"" she said. ""Every life is valuable, and there's no price on life. I am for protecting our students, and I agree that Narcan is a lifesaver. But I think it can also become a crutch and stop some people from taking personal responsibility.""

Walsh's reservations echo those of past opponents of setting up needle exchanges and distributing condoms to stop the spread of AIDS, who argued that such moves were just encouraging drug use and sex.

Akron, Ohio, Board of Education member Debbie Walsh. Akron Public Schools

But Walsh's logic did not fly with Dr. Matthew Davis, a professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine and head of general pediatrics at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago.

""Health care workers in hospitals and first responders in communities have had naloxone on hand for decades, but there is no evidence that having naloxone as an antidote has encouraged Americans to try street drugs and abuse prescription opioids,"" Davis wrote in an email to NBC News. ""Similarly, we would not expect teens to abuse opioids because naloxone is available in their schools.""

Naloxone, he wrote, must be ""part of comprehensive drug use prevention programs in schools and communities, to try to reduce drug use among teens.""

""Making naloxone available in junior high and high schools is smart public health policy, given what is known about teens' misuse of prescription opioid medicines and teens' use of heroin in the U.S. today,"" he added.

Having naloxone on hand ""is just like putting a defibrillator on the gym wall for a heart attack, or having injections of epinephrine available for someone who can't breathe because of a severe allergic reaction,"" he wrote. ""They are tools made available to save lives.""

Ohio has been hit especially hard by the national opioid overdose epidemic. In 2015, it recorded 3,050 drug overdose deaths. And preliminary data for 2016 from the state Health Department show the death toll rising to 3,986.

“ The school nurse is often the first health professional who responds to an emergency in the school setting. When administered quickly and effectively, naloxone has the potential to immediately restore breathing to a victim experiencing an opioid overdose.”

The young have not been spared. In the 15-19 age group, there were 23 fatal overdoses in 2014, 31 in 2015 and 29 last year.

Summit County, which is where Akron is located, saw a spike in fatal overdoses for that age group last year, with nine — up from three in 2015 and one in 2014. But no opiate overdose deaths were reported there or anywhere else in Ohio for youths ages 10 through 14, which includes middle school students.

To prevent more teenagers from dying, Gov. John Kasich has taken a number of steps that include ""expanding access to naloxone to save lives,"" said Russ Kennedy, a Health Department spokesman.

""It is a local decision by schools regarding whether they want to carry naloxone,"" Kennedy said.

Margaret Cellucci of the National Association of Schools Nurses said it is a position the organization endorses.

""The school nurse is often the first health professional who responds to an emergency in the school setting,"" NASN said in its position statement.

""When administered quickly and effectively, naloxone has the potential to immediately restore breathing to a victim experiencing an opioid overdose,"" it said.

Akron, the fifth-largest city in Ohio, with a population of near 200,000, has six high schools and nine middle schools."

She’d greet her partner each morning with a homemade country breakfast, and their afternoons and evenings would be filled with lively games of Spades and Bid Whist with a dozen or so housemates — all fellow LGBTQ elders.

The sparse research available on black LGBTQ elders reveals chronic levels of discrimination, poverty, social isolation and physical and mental health disparities. SAGE

“I’ve already picked out my rocking chair,” the retired substance abuse counselor quipped. “Just call me ‘Mama C,’ and make sure my room is in the front, so I can always see everything going on, and I’m happy.”

For now, her dream is in stark contrast of her reality. She and her partner of 30 years, a 78-year-old woman whose names she prefers not to mention, have had health challenges, forcing them to live on a fixed budget in pricey Washington, D.C.

They can only afford to live in a crumbling six-bedroom townhome, which they share with three middle-aged and older straight and lesbian women. After the basics, much of their income is spent on health care and, often, an ever-growing list of repairs for the house, which has been in her partner’s family for more than six decades.

Hayden Smith and her partner are among the estimated 2.7 million adults age 50 and older in the U.S. who self-identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) — about 1.1 million are 65 and older. Approximately 20 percent of LGBTQ older adults are people of color, a number expected to double by 2050.

A Triple Threat?

Although economic, social, physical and mental health disparities are high among all LGBTQ older adults, the complexities of race, age, sexual orientation and gender identity are especially challenging for many black LGBTQ elders. And advocates say public policy changes, such as the Trump administration’s promised repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which in its most recent version includes deep cuts to Medicaid, will make their predicament worse.

“ It gets to a point where you wake up and say, 'Which fight am I going to fight today?'”—Dr. Imani Woody

“We’ve got LGBTQ [status] and age, so we really have two oppressions against us,” Dr. Imani Woody, 65, an African-American lesbian and LGBTQ activist in Washington, D.C., explained. “And when you put race and gender on top of that, it just gets harder. It gets to a point where you wake up and say, 'Which fight am I going to fight today?'""

The sparse research available on this embattled group reveals chronic levels of discrimination, poverty, social isolation and physical and mental health disparities.

One-third of LGBTQ older adults live at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, including 40 percent of African American LGBTQ older adults, according to one groundbreaking report co-authored by Services and Advocacy for GLBT Elders (SAGE), the nation’s oldest and largest advocacy group for LGBTQ elders, and LGBTQ think-tank Movement Advancement Project (MAP) released in May.

Advocates attribute the economic disparities of black LGBTQ elders to longstanding race, age and LGBTQ discrimination, which has been exacerbated by a lack of equal protection under the law and social stigma. Neglect and isolation are especially prevalent when their peers — the only support network many of them have due to family rejection — die off or age themselves, as research shows older LGBTQ adults are less likely to be partnered or married or to have children to depend on as caregivers.

“Our generation did so much [for LGBTQ and civil rights], we shouldn’t just be thrown away,” Hayden Smith said. “It’s sad, but so many of us feel invisible as we get older. If we don’t take care of ourselves, we’re going to get lost in the sauce.”

Aging with Pride: National Health, Aging and Sexuality/Gender Study is the first federally-funded longitudinal national project designed to better understand the aging, health and well-being of LGBTQ midlife and older adults and their families. Aging with Pride

Root Causes

“African-Americans reported the highest levels of lifetime LGBTQ-related discrimination, and both African-Americans and Hispanics reported lower levels of household income, education, affirmation of their identities and social support compared to non-Hispanic white LGBTQ older adults,” said Dr. Karen Fredriksen-Goldsen, lead researcher on the ""Aging With Pride: National Health, Aging and Sexuality/Gender Study.""

Though not focused exclusively on elders of color, her study, the largest ever nationally on LGBTQ older adults, found a common bond among African-American and Hispanic LGBTQ older adults.

“It’s sad, but so many of us feel invisible as we get older.”—Cecelia Hayden Smith

“[They both] reported higher levels of spirituality than non-Hispanic whites, and spirituality was found to be associated with their well-being. The findings indicate distinct challenges and resilience among LGBTQ older adults of color,"" Fredriksen-Goldsen explained.

In addition, a 2014 SAGE report found African-American LGBTQ older adults were four times more likely than their Hispanic and white counterparts — 26 percent versus 8 percent — to consider people from their churches or faith as part of their support systems.

Jenna McDavid, of the Diverse Elders Coalition, said this information provides great opportunity: “Exploring more ways for faith communities to be inclusive could be monumental for so many elders in need of support,"" she explained.

Plans call for 15 efficiency units and, on the grounds, a ""stone wall,"" commemorating the 1969 historic Stonewall riots. Courtesy Mary's House D.C.

Discrimination and Isolation

While many advocates say the legalization of same-sex marriage has been helpful to the well-being of LGBTQ elders, many who have not married still struggle to receive the financial and family protections afforded to unmarried, different-sex couples – especially after their partner dies or suffers a chronic illness.

Nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are especially problematic for black LGBTQ elders, according to Kenneth Mitchell, 62, a black gay man living in New Orleans. “The fear of abuse and discrimination [is so strong that many] end up going back into the closet,” he said.

“People need to be able to be their true selves; being fearful and stressed impacts your quality of life and your physical and mental health,"" added Mitchell, who serves as a board member for New Orleans Advocates for GLBT Elders (NOAGE).

Cedric Burgess, 65, a black gay man in Washington D.C., agrees that a fear of backlash and discrimination pushes many to retreat. “It’s not the same as being a young gay person; there’s less to do, and many of our peers have died from the AIDS epidemic,” he said. “One of the biggest concerns is isolation and suicide. People need people to talk to.”

To that end, NOAGE, SAGE and GRIOT Circle, a nonprofit focused on the needs of older LGBTQ people of color, host regular social events to engage LGBTQ elders. NOAGE also provides free training for senior service providers in the New Orleans area on how to deliver culturally competent health care, adding that many service providers don’t realize LGBTQ discrimination is illegal in federally funded facilities.

Mary’s House

Dr. Imani Woody is trying to do her part to help LGBTQ elders. One way the advocate is trying to do so is by making that cozy retirement house Hayden Smith dreams of a reality. She's currently raising money to transform her childhood home into Mary’s House, an affordable, independent living home for LGBTQ elders in Washington, D.C.

The plans call for 15 efficiency units, a “stone wall” on the grounds commemorating the 1969 Stonewall Inn Riots and a yellow brick road — a nod to days past when gay men would clandestinely identify each other by asking, “Are you a friend of Dorothy?""

Hayden Smith and Cedric Burgess are ambassadors for Mary's House, which they both eventually hope to call home for themselves and fellow LGBTQ elders of color for many years to come.

“It’s tough out there, but at least at Mary’s House they’ll have a family and a place to call home,"" Dr. Woody said.

The removal of the devices followed the resolution of a 24-hour diplomatic standoff with Jordan over a deadly shooting at the Israeli Embassy in the kingdom, suggesting a broader deal had been struck.

However, there were signs Tuesday that the crisis over the shrine, revered by Muslims and Jews, was not over yet.

Israel announced it would replace the metal detectors with new security measures. This would include ""advanced technologies,"" reportedly sophisticated cameras, and additional police deployments.

Muslim leaders had demanded that security arrangements go back to what they were before the metal detectors were erected.

Ikrema Sabri, a senior Muslim cleric, said Tuesday that Muslims should stay away from the shrine, pending a review of the new Israeli measures. The review could be completed by the end of the day.

""Our position is that for now, nobody should enter,"" he told The Associated Press.

The 37-acre esplanade in Jerusalem's Old City is the third holiest site of Islam and the holiest of Judaism, once home to biblical Temples. It sits on the fault line of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and triggered several major confrontations in the past.

Israel had erected metal detectors at the gates to the Muslim-administered site last week, after Arab gunmen killed two Israeli police guards there.

The move incensed the Muslim world, amid allegations that Israel was trying to expand control over the site under the guise of security — a claim Israel denies.

Large crowds of Muslim worshippers prayed outside the shrine in protest every day, refusing to pass through the metal detectors.

Israel has denied it has a hidden agenda, portraying the metal detectors as a needed means to prevent attacks.

The diplomatic crisis with Jordan over the embassy shooting lent more urgency to finding a solution.

Israel's security Cabinet, meanwhile, announced it would replace the metal detectors with ""advanced technologies,"" reportedly cameras that can detect hidden objects.

The Cabinet said police would increase the deployment of forces until the new measures are in place. The statement said the government would budget $28 million to implement the security plan over a period of ""up to six months.""

http://www.today.com/health/fluid-leaking-brain-ear-linked-obesity-t112673,nbcnews,Fluid leaking from brain into ear is linked to obesity,['A. Pawlowski'],"share tweet pin email

By the time Mark Hoffman went through 5,000 cotton balls trying to soak up a clear fluid constantly oozing out of his ear, he’d already seen countless doctors to figure out what was happening.

The problem started in 2006: When he’d wake up in the morning, his right ear was wet and his pillow soaked. The issue came and went, but it really intensified last summer when the fluid started dripping every few seconds.

“It was a mystery for me for 10 years,” Hoffman, 53, who lives in Akron, Indiana, told TODAY. “Nobody had any idea what this was.”

Courtesy Mark Hoffman Mark Hoffman underwent surgery last December to repair the leak in his head.

The answer — when he finally received a diagnosis last year — was something right out of a medical thriller: The watery substance was actually fluid leaking out of Hoffman’s brain after a hole had somehow developed in his skull.

The condition, which seems to be linked to obesity, is on the rise in the U.S., with surgeries to fix it doubling in the last decade, said Dr. Rick Nelson, a neurotologist at IU Health and an assistant professor of otolaryngology at Indiana University School of Medicine.

“People don’t really think about this complication of obesity and that they can end up needing brain surgery for it,” he said.

Nelson, who has been researching the phenomenon for years, says most patients are middle-aged and overweight. About 70 percent are women.

How it happens:

Your brain and spinal cord are surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, which looks like water. It’s critical for brain function, delivering nutrients and acting as a cushion and shock absorber. Your body keeps making this liquid and recycling it about twice a day in a system that’s tightly enclosed, Nelson said. The fluid is contained by the dura — a tough sac around the brain and along the spinal cord.

For a leak to happen, there has to be a hole in that sac and a hole in the bone of the skull. That can happen after brain surgery or big trauma, like an accident. But more patients, like Hoffman, are developing spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leaks not caused by any surgery or accidents. Something is causing their skulls — but not other bones in their bodies — to get thinner, Nelson said.

In the early 2000s, Nelson would perform two surgeries a year to repair such spontaneous leaks. Now, he performs two to five a month.

Doctors don’t know why it’s happening, but besides excessive weight, sleep apnea may play a role, too, Nelson said. When people momentarily stop breathing at night, the pressure inside the head goes way up and that may start to erode the bones of the skull.

The typical symptom of the condition is fluid in one or both ears that just keeps oozing.

“Patients are surprised to realize there’s brain fluid leaking out of their ear. Clearly, they are thinking it’s just a standard ear infection when it’s actually a connection between the outside world and their brain,” Nelson said.

About 20 percent of people experience meningitis — a brain infection — as their first symptom. Infection is the biggest danger, so the leak has to be repaired with surgery.

Nelson performed the three-hour operation on Hoffman in December and Hoffman hasn’t seen the oozing fluid since.

“It’s a relief. I’ve probably used enough cotton to knit me a sweater, some socks and a few other things,” Hoffman said.

But despite how many visits we make to the local bodega, big-box chains and our go-to grocery store, little thought actually goes into how we navigate them.

“When you walk into a supermarket, your goal is to spend as little money as possible; yet the supermarket wants you to spend as much money as it can wring from your wallet,"" says Natasha Rachel Smith, Personal Finance Expert at TopCashback. ""From product placement to sense strategies, grocery stores are strategically designed to make you want more, and thus spend more.""

It’s time to hack your grocery trip with these smart tips for navigating the store more efficiently, making better (re: cheaper) choices and getting out of there (and back to your scheduled weekend programming) as quickly as possible.

Get in Line Behind the Cart Loaded Up the Most

It’s counter intuitive, but it’s true. Getting in line behind the lady who is buying out the entire produce section will actually get you checked out the fastest.

The science behind reducing your time in line is called Little’s Law, which states that the length of a queue is equal to how long each interaction takes times the number of people or things coming in. So, if you choose a line with lots of people each carrying a few items, the fixed costs (i.e. the interaction between each customer and the checkout clerk) add up with each additional person, but if you choose a line with fewer people that each have more items, the fixed costs are kept low, and you can get through quicker.

Look up and down, not just straight ahead

When wandering the aisles grabbing staples, we tend to focus straight ahead, grabbing the first can of black beans we see. But brands pay for shelf space, so the items that grab your attention front and center aren’t necessarily the most economical choices. Store brands and other generic brands, which tend to be cheaper but almost identical in ingredients, are placed on the bottom shelf.

""Eye level is buy level. Products positioned right in front of you are likely to sell better, so make it a point to shop the lower and higher levels of the shelves to find the best deals,” says Smith.

The number of items on the shelf is planned: Stores want to maximize their sales and provide the top-selling brands with more space. The number of items on the shelf is planned: Stores want to maximize their sales and provide the top-selling brands with more space.

Regardless of what store you’re in, the shelf organization tends to be the same. On the bottom shelf you’ll find store brands, other generic brands and bulk items (aka the savvy shoppers bread and butter). The middle shelf is reserved for leading brands and best sellers (often sold to manufacturers for a fee) and the top shelf is typically local, gourmet and smaller brands.

“Also, don’t let the quantity on the shelf fool you! The ‘number of facings’ or how many items of a product are visible are planned as well. Stores want to maximize their sales and profits and provide the top-selling brands and products with more space. The best way to combat paying more is by shopping for less popular brands.”

Skeptical of going generic? Smith recommends checking the ingredients or materials list before purchasing a generic brand to be reassured you’re getting the same product.

Ask for a Rain Check

You're casually walking down the toilet paper aisle when a bright yellow sign catches your eye. It's your lucky day, your go-to brand is on sale. But as you near the shelf you notice a large gaping hole where the rolls should be. It seems the other extra-soft fans beat you to it.

But instead of accepting defeat and grabbing a (full-price) pack of another brand, ask for a rain check. What does this mean exactly?

“When grocery stores are having a sale on an item that most people use, like detergent, it sells out quickly,"" says Smith. ""Don’t hesitate to ask a grocery store employee for a rain check on sold-out items. Getting an extension on a sold-out sale item will save you money when the item is back to its regular price.”

When it comes to cashing in on savings, be sure to also find out if your grocery store has special discount days for bread and meat.

“Most grocery stores mark down their meat and fresh breads on certain days and times. Find this day and time (this will take a little legwork if the manager isn’t willing to outright tell you the day and time), then buy all your meats and breads at this time,"" says Justin Cupler, savings expert at The Penny Hoarder. ""Sure, they are closer to expiration, but you can extend the meat’s life by freezing it, and bread is typically fine a few days after its sell-by date. You can often save 50 percent off meats and nearly 75 percent off breads by waiting for these discounts to hit.""

Check the Cost-Per-Unit

When it comes to those staple items that always make the grocery list there’s a rule of thumb to follow: Buy in bulk.

“Things like yogurt, tissues, paper towels, ice tea, potatoes and apples can be purchased separately or in bags or multipacks. It almost never pays to buy singles, which can boost your cost by 40 percent or more,” says Lisa Lee Freeman, savings expert at Flipp app.

How do you know if buying in bulk is really a better deal?

“Check the unit prices on items that you are comparing. This will help you to see that the cost-per-unit on one item may be less than the cost-per-unit on a comparable item, which would mean a better deal for you,” says Tiffany Welka, accredited wealth management advisor with VFG Associates.

Skip Convenience Items

We know, those little hummus packs perfectly paired with baby carrots are a god-send on a frazzled Monday morning. But you’re paying a major premium for that convenience — which with a little forethought (and a Tupperware container) couldn’t be easier to do on your own.

Instead of paying more for snack-sized items, buy the largest size possible, which tends to be the best deal (see: cost per unit).

“For example, ounce per ounce, a regular container of Jif peanut butter costs 40 percent less than Jif to Go singles,” said Freeman. “Make your own singles with tiny plastic containers. You can use the same method with yogurt, cottage cheese and fruit cups. And use little plastic baggies for chips, pretzels, candy and other snacks that are often sold in single-serve packaging at a big premium.”

A regular container of Jif peanut butter costs 40 percent less than Jif to Go singles. A regular container of Jif peanut butter costs 40 percent less than Jif to Go singles.

The same goes for other convenience items like pre-washed bags of salad, pre-cut veggies and sliced chicken. Always go big and whole — and cut and package yourself.

Don’t fall victim to marketing ploys

You know to put your blinders on while you’re waiting in the checkout line — with magazines and candy bars calling your name. But that isn’t the only place in the store that you need to be on high alert.

“Everyone knows that the checkout line is a trap. Candy, soda, mints and magazines. These point-of-purchase displays are designed to get us to add a handful of high margin items to our cart at the last minute,” said Ian Atkins, Financial Analyst FitSmallBusiness.com. “What's less well known is that the entire grocery store is designed the same way. The temperature, the music, the displays — everything is designed to encourage you to buy more, buy higher margin products and buy items that were not on your list. Stick to your list or risk falling for the checkout line trick,” Atkins adds.

In addition to staying focused on your list, Dr. Paul Harrison, Chair of Consumer Behavior in the Department of Marketing at the Deakin Business School, says to be wary of displays placed in the perimeter of the store and at the end of aisles. Leading brands are placed strategically in high trafficked areas, like the perimeter since people tend to use it as a home base. (That explains the random cracker display in the produce aisle.) The products with the greatest profit margins, or those that have paid a premium, will be placed at the ends of aisles in end cap displays, says Harrison.

Pass on the samples

Those free bites of cedar-planked salmon aren’t just being offered out of the goodness of your grocery stores heart. There is strong scientific evidence behind the ability of samples to coax more money out of your pocket.

“Reciprocity is a very, very strong instinct,” Dan Ariely, a behavioral economist at Duke University, told The Atlantic. “If somebody does something for you, you really feel a rather surprisingly strong obligation to do something back for them.” Like grab a jar of that tomato sauce ladled over your tiny cup of penne.

“What samples do is they give you a particular desire for something,” he says. “If I gave you a tiny bit of chocolate, all of a sudden it would remind you about the exact taste of chocolate and would increase your craving.”

A 2011 study in the British Food Journal looked at the practice of putting out free samples. What they found is that majority of us aren’t very good at declining the offer when shopping. In fact 75 percent of those surveyed took the free sample when offered one. Once you’ve taken a bite, you’re not only more likely to switch from your habitual brand if the item was already on your list (which, chances are, is costing you more money), but you’re also more likely to buy the item if it wasn’t originally in your plans (which is definitely costing you more money). The researchers also found that people were more likely to purchase the product they sampled if the station was manned by a person — which supports Ariely’s hypothesis that our guilty conscience kicks in when someone gives us a taste test for free.

So the next time you spot an employee offering up chocolate chip cookies, clutch your wallet and make a beeline for the exit."

Trump spoke to Putin at the end of a couples-only social dinner at the summit in Hamburg, Germany, the official said, reiterating it was a social dinner. Pull-asides are typically less formal than official bilateral meetings, which Trump and Putin also shared.

The White House did not previously disclose or offer a record of what was discussed during the meeting, which was first reported by Ian Bremmer, president of the international consulting firm Eurasia Group.

The meeting was ""brief,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters off-camera Wednesday, pushing back on reports that the pull-aside lasted an hour.

""We weren't following him around with a stopwatch,"" she said, but ""certainly not an hour.""

Sanders labelled scrutiny of the meeting as the media's ""Russian fever"" and blamed news outlets for trying ""to create a story that didn't exist.""

The White House defended criticisms about their lack of transparency on the meeting by saying the dinner was on both the president's and G20 summit's schedules and that it would be ""incredibly awkward to sit at dinner and not speak to each other.""

During that Friday night dinner, Putin was seated next to first lady Melania Trump.

Trump and Putin's first face-to-face meeting as world leaders came while in Germany, with the bilateral lasting over two hours. During that meeting, Putin denied meddling in the 2016 presidential election, though it still remains unclear whether or not Trump accepted the Kremlin's version of events. Russian officials, including Putin, have indicated that Trump accepted Putin's denial.

White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said President Trump ""heard"" Putin's denial ""and he moved forward with places they thought they could work together.""

Trump took to Twitter Tuesday night to downplay the encounter.

The Fake News is becoming more and more dishonest! Even a dinner arranged for top 20 leaders in Germany is made to look sinister! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 19, 2017

White House also said any insinuation that it tried to hide a second meeting with Putin is false, malicious and absurd.

Putin consistently tries to meet with U.S. presidents one-on-one, Mike McFaul, a former U.S. Ambassador to Russia, told MSNBC. However, having such conversations without advisers present or talking points on hand, Trump may have made commitments to Putin that American diplomats may have a hard time contradicting at a later date, McFaul said.

""I worry about what kind of commitment the president might have made and, once he makes that commitment — this is very important — once he says that to Putin, Putin then reads that out to his government, he then tells his negotiator, Deputy Foreign Minister Ryabkov, this is what the president of the United States says. That makes is very difficult for the American diplomats to somehow contradict what Ryabkov might bring up at that meeting,"" McFaul said.

The Trump-Putin relationship has been highly scrutinized amid ongoing investigations into Russian meddling in the election, which includes a probe into whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russia. Trump and his team have repeatedly denied those allegations.

Take Steve, who voted for Labour in every election since coming of age, campaigned for the party many times and helped run his local branch.

Still, the 45-year-old psychologist says his hand hesitated over the ballot as he got ready to vote in the last election in June.

“This was the first time in my life that I’ve struggled to vote for Labour — I’ve been a proud member of the party my entire life,” said Steve, from the northern town of Derby, who asked that his full name not be used for fear of retaliation in his local party.

Steve paused before voting for Labour because of what he sees as an increase of anti-Semitism both online and in real life under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, a socialist who has seen newfound prestige thanks to his party’s better-than-expected results in the summer's national election.

""There are members of my local branch that now won't speak with me because they know I'm Jewish,"" he said. ""This was never the case and only started in the last two years.""

A survey conducted just before the election by polling company Survation and The Jewish Chronicle newspaper found that Labour held the backing of only 13 percent of British Jews. In recent years, the party has come under criticism for its leader's past ties with anti-Israel groups, and what they say is light discipline of members who have made anti-Semitic comments.

Corbyn’s office didn’t respond to requests for a comment for this article.

'An occasionally toxic atmosphere'

“There’s a certain section of his supporters, not all of them, that really struggle to understand that you can be a Jew and in the party and also support Israel without being a supporter of the right wing,” said Hannah, who asked that her name not be used for fear for her safety. “It’s black and white to them. If you have any sympathy for Israel, they are triggered and can’t control themselves.”

Hannah said that since Corbyn became the Labour Party's leader in 2015, she has received “countless” anti-Semitic messages on social media, including a particularly distressing photo of a man with a knife in his back and the caption, “Serves him right, he trusted a k---,"" using racial slur for someone of Jewish descent.

The party itself appears to be taking these fears seriously, commissioning a report into anti-Semitism in April 2016. It found that there was “an occasionally toxic atmosphere” in the party, but that it “is not overrun by anti-Semitism, Islamophobia or other forms of racism.”

Yet the concerns are persistent, marking a sharp departure for Labour, which has repeatedly sponsored legislation promoting equality in the U.K., including on pay, gender and religion.

For most of its history, Labour was the most pro-Jewish and pro-Zionist of all the major political parties in the country, according to Daniel Allington, a professor of sociology at Leicester University who researches the rise of anti-Semitism on the left.

However, over the past three years, its leadership has been more critical of Israel's policies, and Corbyn has said that he would immediately recognize a state of Palestine if he became prime minister, which some see as dangerous if it came with no political conditions attached.

Corbyn's controversial 'friends'

Corbyn himself used to be a millstone around the Labour Party’s neck — in June 2016, a majority of his own legislators in Parliament passed a motion of no confidence in the vain hope that he would quit.

Now, the opposition leader, who is strongly against nuclear weapons and who believes in the re-nationalization of the railways and other public services, has helped his party overtake the Conservative Party in the polls. The most recent YouGov poll showed an 8-point lead for Labour.

In addition to accusations that Corbyn hasn’t cracked down hard enough on hostility to Jews, he himself has a mixed history with the Jewish community. Reading through his past comments about Israel — which plays a strong role in the identity of many British Jews — is jarring in comparison to comments by other political leaders, past and present.

At the unveiling of the report into anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, Corbyn seemed to compare Israel to the ISIS terror group, shocking many of his own Labour legislators.

“The Jewish community was seeing [anti-Semitic incidents] as a course of conduct and Labour was seeing it as isolated events”

“Our Jewish friends are no more responsible for the actions of Israel or the [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu government than our Muslim friends are for those various self-styled Islamic states or organisations,"" he said at the event.

A bigger issue for many was Corbyn’s invitation to representatives of Hamas and Hezbollah to an event in Parliament in 2009, when he was a rebellious Labour MP and not in the government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Both groups are classified by the U.K. and U.S. as terrorist groups, and have repeatedly called for the destruction of the State of Israel.

At the time, he called the groups “friends,” while also commenting that they’re “dedicated toward the good of the Palestinian people and bringing about long-term peace and social justice and political justice.”

After becoming Labour leader he said he regretted calling them “friends.”

In addition, his paid appearances before he became leader on Iran-owned Press TV, a station now banned in the U.K., have won him few admirers in the Jewish community.

“I don’t believe for a minute that Jeremy Corbyn is an anti-Semite,” said Harry Fletcher, a former Corbyn adviser who helped with his 2015 leadership campaign. “It’s an institutional thing. It’s not conscious. It’s mixed up with the left of the party, which has complete antipathy to State of Israel and many would say that it shouldn’t exist.”

Tumultuous time for party

Corbyn’s newfound popularity comes after a tumultuous two years in the party, including the suspensions of high-profile Labour politicians, such as powerful former London Mayor Ken Livingstone.

In April 2016, Livingstone insisted that Adolf Hitler supported Zionism. He was suspended from holding office in the party for two years, angering some who felt the punishment was too lenient and who wanted him expelled.

Meanwhile, in February 2016, the head of the Oxford University Labour Club resigned, describing “poisonous” attitudes among certain members of the club. He recounted members of the executive “throwing around the term ‘Zio,’” a slur for Zionists, and a former co-chair saying that “most accusations of anti-Semitism are just the Zionists crying wolf.”

A Labour Party investigation into the club found that there had been “some incidents of anti-Semitic behavior.”

Among those reporting anti-Semitic abuse were several Jewish members of Parliament, including Louise Ellman, who represents Liverpool Riverside. Not long after Corbyn took power, Ellman faced rowdy meetings in her district, with pro-Corbyn party members reportedly making anti-Semitic remarks and attacking her position on Israel.

She said the party is investigating the events.

“There are some individuals engaging in traditional anti-Semitism, such as making references to Jews financing slavery, and others who are anti-Zionist to the degree that they become associated with people who denigrate Jews as a whole,” said Ellman on the phone from her office in Parliament.

“Anti-Semitism is of concern, but there are many in the party who are outraged about what’s happening,” she added.

Influential voting bloc

To understand how extraordinary it is for a particular group to feel alienated from Labour, one must look at the party’s history.

Labour has traditionally stood against discrimination and many of its most influential members and vocal supporters have been Jewish. There are scores of former and current Jewish Labour members of Parliament, including former party leader Ed Milliband, who has Jewish heritage, but grew up an atheist.

And while there are only around 250,000 Jews in Britain today, their influence at the ballot box may be significant when no political party has an outright majority in Parliament.

According to an analysis by Allington, the sociology professor, there was a statistical relationship between a constituency’s Jewish population and its swing to the Labour candidate in this past election, belying trends in similar areas.

“The higher [an area’s] Jewish population, the lower the rise in the Labour vote this election,” he said. “If just two seats had gone the other way — with things being so finely balanced — it would have been much harder for the Conservative Party to form a government.”

The Conservative Party is eight seats short of a majority in Parliament and needed to secure the agreement of a small party from Northern Ireland to get their governing agenda through Parliament last month.

One of the main problems, according to Fletcher, is that Corbyn acknowledges individual incidents of anti-Semitism but does not see them as part of systemic problem.

“The Jewish community was seeing [anti-Semitic incidents] as a course of conduct and Labour was seeing it as isolated events,” said Fletcher. “They saw it as a pattern which led them to conclude that there must be deep-rooted anti-Semitism with Corbyn and the Labour Party, and he saw it as incidents he dealt with.”

'A lot more needs to be done'

With Corbyn and his left-wing of the party looking firmly entrenched for the foreseeable future, there does seem to be a desire to find a new working relationship between Labour and the Jewish community.

“Since the election the [inter-Labour] factional fight has died down a bit, and hopefully that will open space for trust, engagement and reconciliation on both sides,” said Alex Nunns, author of the upcoming book “The Candidate: Jeremy Corbyn's Improbable Path to Power.”

The Jewish Leadership Council, as well as the office of Shadow Minister Dawn Butler, who is responsible for interacting with minority communities on behalf of the Labour Party, declined to comment — noting that while discussions are ongoing they aren’t ready to speak publicly yet.

Despite what seems like a public détente between Corbyn, his supporters, and the Jewish community at the moment, Ellman notes there is still a lot of work to do to fight anti-Semitism in the party.

“There is a greater understanding of the nature of the problem,” said Ellman. “It’s an ongoing issue. It is changing slowly, but a lot more needs to be done.”"

Almost the entire range of flagship Samsung phones, various iPhones, and devices made by HTC, LG, and Nexus have the Broadcom BCM43xx family of Wi-Fi chips, which were found to have a vulnerability.

Smartphone hacking is heavily focused on operating systems, but researcher Nitay Artenstein, who spent a year reverse engineering the Wi-Fi chips and pouring through code, said in his research that this shows how important it is to test peripheral components.

""Old school hackers often miss the 'good old days' of the early 2000s, when remotely exploitable bugs were abundant, no mitigations were in place to stop them, and worms and malware ran rampant,"" he wrote in a blog post. ""But with new research opening previously unknown attack surface such as the BCM WiFi chip, those times may just be making a comeback.""

But not all drug treatments are created equal. An NBC News investigation found that federal loopholes have allowed unscrupulous drug treatment centers in South Florida to turn the nation's opioid crisis into gold. They've billed insurance companies for millions of dollars' worth of counseling and testing without helping addicts recover.

How can families seeking treatment for a loved one learn to separate the ""bad actors"" from the good?

Experts and law enforcement officials have created lists of warning signs and questions that patients and their families should ask.

Watch Out For:

● Generic websites or advertisements that don't clearly identify what treatment programs the site or advertiser represents. They may just be collecting phone numbers and email addresses for patient ""brokers,"" who will then try to connect you with whatever treatment center is paying them.

● Whether the person you're speaking to receives referral fees from the treatment center. ""Brokers"" are paid by the head to get you or your loved one into a particular treatment center, whether or not it's the right one for you.

● Offers to pay for travel. If someone is offering to cover travel to Florida or another location, call the treatment facility or your insurance company to confirm that the person is an employee. In certain states, paying for travel may also be considered an illegal inducement.

● Offers to pay for insurance coverage or to waive co-pays or deductibles. See above.

● Offers of free rent from ""sober homes"" — the offsite homes where addiction patients are often housed — in exchange for attending a particular drug treatment program.

● Daily or near-daily lab tests that cost thousands of dollars.

● A treatment center that doesn't ask for in-depth information about the patient or doesn't ask for access to any therapists or counselors previously used by the patient. Without this information, the center won't be able to assess whether the patient is a good fit.

● Unsolicited referrals from marketers or hotlines to treatment centers out of state. Treatment centers that aren't in your state may be considered out of network by your insurance company, meaning the centers will be able to bill the insurers more.

Questions You Should Ask:

● What's the staff-to-patient ratio? The lower the ratio, the better. Are the counselors certified chemical dependency counselors?

● Does the facility have a medical director on staff? Are the doctors associated with the program certified by the American Society of Addiction Medicine?

● Can the treatment center handle other medical needs, like mental health issues or diseases like hepatitis C?

● Are licensed staffers available 24 hours a day?

● What kinds of support are offered after treatment? Does the program have an ""alumni"" program that offers followup, and does it help families put together an after-care plan?

● Is the program able to adapt to the medical history, trauma background, culture or gender identity of the patient?

● Is the center in-network with your insurance? If not, what out-of-pocket expenses should you expect?

● Is the program transparent, or does it simply tell you what you want to hear?

Not every program is a fit for every person. Schedule a tour and do research online. In addition to looking at the treatment center's website and social media presences, read reviews, learn what others are saying about their treatment experiences and check whether the program is accredited.

There are other resources out there. The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration provides a toll-free, confidential hotline along with a treatment services search tool. The Partnership at DrugFree.org has a helpline and tips so families know what to ask. Similarly, Treatment Research Institute has a step-by-step guide of Questions to Ask Treatment Programs.

There's also a vibrant network of online groups have also cropped up, like those run by the nonprofit Magnolia New Beginnings. Founder Maureen Cavanagh said members in the closed groups are vetted, so once they're inside, they can trust that the advice they get is good and can feel free to voice their pain and provide emotional support.

""They realize, sometimes for the first time, that there are other people going through this and they're not alone,"" Cavanagh said. ""The worst thing in the whole world is to feel like you can't talk to anybody about this."""

Savings benchmarks based on age and income can offer a quick assessment — but you shouldn't entirely base your plan on them.

To pull out a few examples, JPMorgan Asset Management's 2016 Guide to Retirement reports that someone age 40 with an annual household income of $100,000 should have 2.6 times that amount put away for retirement. By age 60, the bank estimates, that multiple should be 7.3. At Fidelity, the latest ""savings factors"" released in fall 2015 call for a 40-year-old worker to have saved an amount equivalent to three times his salary, and by age 60, eight times salary. (See charts below for others.)

Hitting those multiples can seem like a tall order. Despite swelling ranks of 401(k) millionaires, many people have saved far less. A quarter of workers say their family has less than $1,000 in savings and investments, according to the 2016 Retirement Confidence Survey from the Employee Benefit Research Institute and Greenwald & Associates. Only 14 percent said their family has set aside $250,000 or more.

CNBC

That's exactly the point of benchmarks, the banks say. Many consumers don't take advantage of more in-depth retirement calculators and other tools, so they don't know just how close or far off they are to meeting their savings goals, said Katherine Roy, chief retirement strategist for JPMorgan Asset Management. Benchmarks offer a quick litmus test.

""It's a great way to create an immediate recognition that you may not be where you need to be, and that you need to sit down and create a more comprehensive plan,"" she said.

That might mean escalating your contributions, or socking away more of your next raise, said John Sweeney, executive vice president of retirement and investing strategies for Fidelity.

""Think about not expanding your lifestyle to accommodate the new income,"" he said.

Consumers who are hitting or exceeding benchmarks could take that as an indication it's time to revisit their plan with an eye to funding other life goals, he said.

CNBC

But advisors caution that benchmarks — like blanket estimates that you might need $1 million, $2.5 million or more for a solid retirement — easily miss the mark. The underlying assumptions about investment returns, income needs and years in retirement aren't one-size-fits-all, said certified financial planner Cathy Seeber, a partner at Wescott Financial Advisory Group in Philadelphia.""

The only time they would ever work is if everything else in your life is status quo,"" she said. ""It rarely is.

You might need more or less than a benchmark says you do depending on things including your health, anticipated retirement age and lifestyle in retirement. ""Your pre-retirement income might have no bearing whatsoever on your post-retirement needs,"" he said.

If you do consult benchmarks, don't be surprised to see the goal numbers shift.

""The objective is not to try to change the goal posts on folks quarterly,"" said Sweeney, but to incorporate new trends and data.

RELATED: Is a Mandatory Retirement Plan in Your Future?

Fidelity tweaked its equation last fall to factor in consumers' longer lifespan and the rising full retirement age of 67 for Social Security. The latest version of JPMorgan's assessments lowered pre-retirement return assumptions from 7 percent to 6.5 percent, with the net effect of higher benchmarks.

""If the market won't work as much for you, the one variable you can control is how much you save,"" Roy said.

Check your retirement savings progress at least on an annual basis and during times of major transition (say, getting married or divorced or switching jobs).

It turns out that wasn't the first time the company illegally imported artifacts.

An attorney for the retailer confirmed to NBC News that the $3 million it will pay the federal government to settle a civil case isn't a fine but a payment to cover unspecified items that were improperly brought to the United States before the 2010 acquisition.

Hobby Lobby didn't forfeit those purchases because it doesn't have them any longer. A stipulation outlining the settlement said they are ""dissipated,"" suggesting they were either sold or donated.

But the company declined to answer questions about the earlier items, including whether any of them were given to the soon-to-open Museum of the Bible in Washington, which Hobby Lobby helped fund.

""This shows this is not a one-off. They made these kinds of mistakes repeatedly,"" said Candida Moss, a professor at Notre Dame and co-author of the forthcoming ""Bible Nation: The United States of Hobby Lobby.""

""They should definitely be opening up their book,"" Moss said.

Hobby Lobby, which has more than 700 stores across the United States, is owned by billionaire evangelical Christians who began amassing an unparalleled private collection of Bible-related texts and artifacts in 2009.

Related: Where Do Hobby Lobby's Antiquities Come From?

Last week, prosecutors in New York announced the chain had signed a civil settlement over hundreds of Mesopotamian-era tablets covered in ancient cuneiform writing and thousands of clay tokens known as bullae that it bought from overseas dealers in 2010.

The U.S. Attorney's office said the rarities originated from what is now Iraq, where the plunder of cultural treasures spurred the U.S. to impose an import ban more than a decade ago.

Hobby Lobby blamed the smuggling on inexperience, saying it had relied on dealers and shippers who didn't know how to properly document or send the pieces.

Prosecutors, however, pointed out that Hobby Lobby had proceeded with the 2010 purchase despite flagrant red flags — including a warning from an expert who told them the types of pieces they eventually bought were likely to be from Iraq and at risk of having been looted or smuggled.

The company also wired payments to seven bank accounts for five different people, none of whom were the actual seller, prosecutors said. The artifacts were sent in multiple shipments to three different corporate addresses in Oklahoma with labels that said the country of origin was Turkey or Israel. They were described in some cases as ""samples"" or ""handmade tiles.""

Federal authorities have been criticized for not bringing criminal charges against Hobby Lobby, but the civil complaint contains no evidence the forfeited items were looted from Iraq or that company officials orchestrated the shipments.

Still, Hobby Lobby, which says it runs its business on Christian values, faced cries of hypocrisy over the scandal — which also put a cloud over the $500 million Museum of the Bible because of its close ties to the company owners, the Green family.

The museum said last week that ""none of the artifacts identified in the settlement"" — which also includes 144 engraved seals — were ever a part of its collection. But it was not clear if that also applied to the unidentified items purchased before the Iraqi tablets and bullae.

An outside public relations firm retained by Hobby Lobby said the company would not disclose what the items were, the circumstances of their shipment, or where they are now. The U.S. Attorney's office also declined to provide those details.

Joel Baden, a Yale professor and co-author of ""Bible Nation,"" said the lack of transparency is troubling.

""What it means is out there somewhere is more illegally imported stuff,"" he said. ""It's in a museum. It's in someone else's collection. It's somewhere. And it's another example of how insidious the market is.""

Baden also said the disclosure of earlier illegal shipments raises doubts about whether the company was simply naïve.

""At some point,"" he said, ""it turns from an unfortunate incident into a business model."""

The House voted to approve a bill that would replace much of the Affordable Care Act, but the birth control moves come from another action: President Donald Trump’s executive order on religious freedom.

An appeal brought by Christian groups demanding full exemption from the requirement to provide insurance covering contraception under the ACA was heard by the U.S. Supreme Court on March 23, 2016. Joshua Roberts / Reuters file

Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said Thursday he welcomed the executive order. “We will be taking action in short order to follow the President’s instruction to safeguard the deeply held religious beliefs of Americans who provide health insurance to their employees,” Price said in a brief statement.

He did not say what that action would be.

“Religious liberty is our country’s first freedom. Americans of faith play a vital role in caring for our most vulnerable citizens, including the elderly and the poor,” Price added.

But the issue of religious liberty has been at the heart at some of the most high-profile lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act, which includes coverage of all forms of birth control as one of its “essential services.”

Related: Most Americans Support Birth Control Mandate

“This has been the most controversial single issue presented by the ACA, other than the individual mandate. It has spawned about a hundred lawsuits, which tied up the Obama administration for half a decade,” Timothy Jost, an emeritus professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law, wrote in a blog post.

Some furious conservatives have said they do not want to pay for someone else’s birth control, while liberals call it a basic right and health policy experts point out that it is cheaper to pay for birth control than it is to pay for a pregnancy.

Related: SCOTUS Sends Obamacare Contraception Case Back to Lower Courts

But the arguments that have had the most traction in federal courts have been those made by religious groups who say it’s against their beliefs to provide birth control to employees.

Churches and strictly religious organizations are already exempt from the requirement.

Trump’s executive order gives ""regulatory relief"" to employers who object to the mandate. It’s a specific reference to the 2014 Hobby Lobby Supreme Court case, which forced the Obama administration to work out a deal under which others who object can get a third party to do the paperwork and make payments for birth control coverage.

A Catholic order, the Little Sisters of the Poor, were plaintiffs in another suit that went all the way to the Supreme Court and Trump invited some members onstage for the signing of his executive order.

Related: Yes,You Have to Pay for Birth Control, Feds Say

The HHS statement signals the new administration wants to take things further.

That’s delighted religious groups and anti-abortion rights activists but angered pro-choice and women’s health advocates.

“The ‘religious freedom’ pretext President Trump used to justify his executive action is simply a smoke screen to allow big businesses run by religious special interests to discriminate, deny women basic healthcare provisions like birth control and openly impose their religious and political views on others,” said Jon O’Brien, president of Catholics for Choice.

“This executive order is not about protecting religious liberty — it is a direct attack on women’s access to birth control,” Planned Parenthood Executive Vice President Dawn Laguens said in a statement. “A woman’s health should not be up to her boss or politicians.”

Related: Contraception Fell, Medicaid Births Rose When Texas Defunded Planned Parenthood

Jost, an expert on healthcare policy and law, doesn’t think it’s likely HHS will take any extreme action.

“HHS could, through notice and comment rulemaking, conclude that contraceptives are not a women’s preventive service that must be covered by insurers, but it has not done so, and to do so would be politically and legally risky,” he wrote.

“Finally, it is unlikely that the Trump administration will require insurers to offer coverage that does not include contraceptives. It may be that some employers and individuals will seek to purchase coverage that does not include contraceptives, but that no such coverage will be available for them to purchase. It is unlikely that a new rule will change this.”"

And, from phone cases to portable chargers to music on-the-go, everything on this list is under $100.

Speck's line of Presidio Inked cases come in bold, stylish designs and patterns with a dual-layer design to help protect from accidental bumps and drops.

Phone Cases

If someone you know is getting a shiny new phone this holiday, help them keep it that way with a beautiful and protective phone case. Speck’s line of Presidio Inked cases (about $30) come in bold, stylish designs and patterns with a dual-layer design to help protect from accidental bumps and drops.

Incipio has the fashion-forward woman and her phone covered with cases from partner fashion designers like Trina Turk, including a new WinterWhite collection with soft tones and solid protection. Because everyone should have a new phone case to celebrate the changing season.

Guys will love the look and feel of OtterBox cases. They’re sturdy and rugged and the Defender series has three levels of protection to guard that precious phone.

For those needing a quick phone charge, slip a Rebecca Minkoff Power Tassel Keychain into their stocking. The tassel, which comes in fun, stylish colors, has a USB on one end and a lightning port on the other, and can hang off a handbag or backpack so it’s always there when you need it.

The Belkin Lightning Audio + Charge RockStar turns that one Lightning port into two, so users can listen to music and charge up at the same time.

iPhone 7 User

We know the included dongle lets iPhone 7 users plug their Lightning Audio headphones into the phone’s Lightning port, but what happens when you need to charge your phone, too? Slip the Belkin Lightning Audio + Charge RockStar into their stocking; it turns that one Lightning port into two, so users can listen to music and charge up at the same time. You know, multi-tasking.

Portable Memory

If your gift recipient’s iPhone never has enough memory for those holiday family photos, the tiny SanDisk iXpand Flash Drive solves that problem by adding up to 128 GB of portable storage. Free up space on the phone by moving photos and videos to the drive, or load up the drive with movies to watch on the way to Grandma’s.

The MyCharge HubXtra has a built-in Lightning as well as micro-USB so you can use it with both Apple and Android devices.

Portable Charger

The best stocking stuffer for someone with lots of smart devices or an older phone is a portable battery charger. One of our faves is the MyCharge HubXtra which has a built-in Lightning as well as micro-USB so you can use with both Apple and Android devices. Or share with a friend.

And for that gym buddy who more often than not arrives with dead headphones, the MyCharge PowerGear Sound Case means they never have to work out without music or headphones again. Simply store the headphones in the protective charging case and plug them into the integrated micro USB cable and the case will make sure they’re charged and ready to go each time.

Car Charger

Not all car chargers are created equal. If you know someone who’s forever forgetting where they parked their car, slip the ZUS Smart Car Charger into their stocking. ZUS charges 2 devices at once, and can locate your car using the companion app and your phone’s GPS. ZUS users can share a family account so if you give this to your teenage driver, you’ll always be able to see where the car is parked. Not that you would ever track your teenager.

Tunes on the Go

Yup, there’s a waterproof, floating, Bluetooth speaker small enough to fit into a stocking and rugged enough to take along on a hike or to the beach. The Altec Lansing Mini H20 has a built-in carabiner for clipping onto a backpack making this ideal for students or music lovers who like to carry their tunes wherever they go.

Roost Smart Battery

You may not think of a 9v battery as a great stocking stuffer, but the Roost Smart Battery has Wi-Fi built in, which makes the battery a “smart” battery.

It connects to your smartphone using an app and alerts you to any issues while you’re not home, lets you snooze an alarm when you’ve simply burned the toast again, and more importantly, notifies you when it’s time to replace the battery way before those 3 a.m. chirps start happening. Roost has a battery life of five years.

Amazon Prime Membership

Amazon Prime isn’t just about the free shipping anymore. Give someone a Prime membership and they’ll have access to a streaming video library for nights spent curling up by the fire, streaming music for playing on an Amazon Echo or other device, free Kindle e-books, and unlimited online photo storage space.

The bachata singer, whose given name is Geoffrey Royce Rojas, brought his FIVE concert tour to his hometown, New York, performing at The Theater at Madison Square Garden. NBC Latino spoke to him Wednesday about his music, the future of his career, and what it was like for him to go from selling phones at a wireless store to performing on stages all across the country.

Born and raised in the Bronx to Dominican immigrant parents, Prince Royce said he has always embraced his Latin culture. ""I spoke Spanish at home, and just in school or in the street... with my friends I speak in English,"" Prince Royce told NBC Latino. ""I went to DR every summer basically, or every other summer at least... I'd stay with my grandparents and that's where I kinda just like started vibing with bachata."" Prince Royce has been on tour since June, in support of his latest album, “FIVE.”

But Prince Royce wasn’t always serenading his fans with hits like “Stand By Me,” “Darte un Beso,” and “Déjà vu” which he sings with Shakira.

Before the fame and concert tours, he was a sales associate hustling for commissions at Sprint Wireless. The money Prince Royce earned at that job is how he made his self-titled first album “Prince Royce”. From humble beginnings, he credits his success to the grit and drive he gained while living in New York.

""The Bronx is a good place. It motivated me to do a lot of what I do now. It still motivates me... you cope with the toughness of it,"" said Prince Royce. ""New York pushed me to become better and I think I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for New York. I don't know, if I grew up somewhere else, I wonder sometimes, if I would have been a singer or if I would have succeeded, ya know? I think the New York hustle is a different type of drive.""

That drive is taking him to Miami to sing the National Anthem at El Clásico on Saturday, alongside Marc Anthony. El Clásico, a soccer game between rivals Real Madrid C.F. and F.C. Barcelona, is one of the biggest games in soccer. ""It's going to be fun... but I'm a little nervous,"" Prince Royce said of singing the anthem. Although he loves both teams, he said he's rooting for F.C. Barcelona.

Apart from singing, Prince Royce wants to explore acting and running. In November, he is running the New York City Marathon. ""I think I'm officially an athlete, I don't know, but let's see,"" he said.

Currently, Prince Royce is raising funds for the National Kidney Foundation and Change for Kids at https://www.crowdrise.com/princeroycerunsnyc.

Prince Royce's FIVE tour ends Sunday in Miami. He said he wants to continue doing something positive for his communities.

""It feels great to feel like you're doing something positive,"" Prince Royce said. ""Taking a risk, and gambling and succeeding, I think it's a story that I hope motivates kids like me... I think everything is possible."""

It isn’t a stretch considering that So, who was born in the Philippines and now lives in United States, is currently the third highest ranked chess player worldwide, according to the July standings published by the World Chess Federation (FIDE).

“The most important thing is to have a very strong mental ability to keep the mind working. But also it’s important to have a very good conditioning, just because the chess game requires so much energy and each game is really long and tiring.”

A grandmaster who has played for the U.S. since November 2014, So will get a crack at achieving his dream in September when he competes at a qualifying event known as the World Chess Cup, held this year in the country of Georgia.

Assuming So moves on to an eight-player tournament next year and wins that, he’ll then face off against Magnus Carlsen, a 26-year-old grandmaster from Norway who has been the world champion since 2013.

“He’s very tough for everybody because he’s been around for a long time,” So told NBC News in a recent interview by phone.

So’s story begins in the Philippines in the city of Bacoor in Cavite, just south of Manila. Born in 1993, So began to take an interest in chess around the age of 7, he said. It started with chess books, old newspaper clippings with algebraic notations of games, and a chessboard at home, according to So.

He played classmates and neighbors and participated in weekly weekend tournaments, So said. His first big win, according to his webpage, came in 2003 when So placed first at the Philippine National Chess Championship for the under-10 age group.

Another success soon followed around 2007.

“I just kept playing until I became a grandmaster at 14 years old,” So explained.

To date, there are a little more than 1,500 people worldwide who claim the grandmaster distinction, according to a tally from the website of the World Chess Federation, the group that bestows the honor.

So almost took that title two years earlier, he said.

“I remember when I was 12 years old, I lost a game in the last round’s tournament,” So recalled. “If I had won that, I would have gotten grand master. But I didn’t get it, and it was very hard for me. I couldn’t sleep for the next few nights, thinking about the game.”

The year 2013 proved another pivotal point in So’s chess-playing career. He won five tournaments, according to his webpage, taking home the gold medal for the Philippines at the 27th Summer Universiade in Kazan, Russia.

But something was missing, according to So.

“To be frank, we weren’t getting enough support, nor were we getting enough recognition,” So said, referring to his time playing for the Philippines.

When he turned 18, So said he got advice from friends who suggested he go abroad “and try to make things better.” He said he studied at Webster University in St. Louis, Missouri, for two-and-a-half years, but left before graduating.

“It’s very difficult to play chess and be a student at the same time,” he said. “It’s practically impossible.”

So said he chose to go professional upon turning 21, a decision he said he made based on advice from a woman named Lotis Key, whom he met at a weekend tournament in Minnesota in 2013.

So, who has residences in Minnesota and St. Louis, also officially switched his chess federation to the U.S. in 2014, according to the group’s website.

“For chess players and also for athletes in general, you only have a small window and it’s better to [do] what you’re doing at a young age than wait to graduate and then go professional,” he explained, adding that he can finish college at any age.

Key, who has become So’s manager, said in an email to NBC News that she was introduced to So at a private dinner that his Filipino host gave while So was competing in Minnesota four years ago.

“My husband and I have worked with a lot of kids in church programs and when we met Wesley we saw that he was lonely and displaced,” Key wrote. “As our relationship with him grew (over about a year) we nurtured him like we would any kid who needed support.

“We are not chess people and had no idea his chess was going to become what it has. He was just an unhappy kid and in getting to the root of it, I found out that he loved chess but didn’t see any future for himself there.”

So, a permanent U.S. resident of Filipino and Chinese descent, refers to Key, her husband, and daughter as his family.

Asked about his biological parents from the Philippines, So said it was “a very private subject” and declined to discuss them.

So has had a busy schedule this year. He said he’s played in around seven events thus far, winning a few like the U.S. championship in April, which comes with a monetary prize.

So is currently ranked as the number-one player by the U.S. Chess Federation.

“Chess is all about regular practice and regular learning, so playing in tournaments I hope to get a lot of experience and just to be more tough for the upcoming world cycle,” he said.

So said he typically sleeps eight to 10 hours a night during and after tournaments.

“The most important thing is to have a very strong mental ability to keep the mind working,” he explained. “But also it’s important to have a very good conditioning, just because the chess game requires so much energy and each game is really long and tiring.”

There’s also the sleepiness that accompanies frequent flights across time zones, a fatigue that So and Key ward off by taking melatonin to combat jet lag, according to So.

For practice, So said he studies the games of his colleagues and competitors and tries to get used to their style.

“And I try to improve my style, learn more about the opening, the middle games, and the end games,” he added.

Having discipline and a strict regimen, So explained, is key considering they are traveling half the year.

“I don’t really have any vices,” So said. “I don’t really like the taste of beer or alcohol, for that matter, and smoking is just bad for your health.”

“For chess players and also for athletes in general, you only have a small window and it’s better to [do] what you’re doing at a young age than wait to graduate and then go professional.”

As the summer wears on, So remains focused on becoming the next world champion.

He has different paths to achieving that goal, according to Key. If he wins the World Chess Cup in September, he’ll move on to the eight-player Candidates Tournament next year, she said. But even if he doesn’t win, the top-two players below Carlsen, the current world champion, are automatically given spots in that tournament, Key said. The winner of the Candidates gets to play Carlsen.

As of July, So ranked number three in the world among active players.

So faced Carlsen in June in matches in Paris and Belgium, beating him once, he said.

“He’s very competitive and very talented,” So said. “So I would need to get better and become stronger if I want to beat him.”

“But first,” he added, “I have to qualify.”

The golden years are great for many reasons: It's often a time meant for relaxing, exploring and enjoying quality time with family. But figuring out where to retire to can be a bit trickier.

Which place has the best health care? What kind of climate do you want? How much money are you willing to spend? Luckily, the Bankrate.com team took all of those factors and more into consideration for a recent survey to reveal which cities are the best and worst places to retire.

Shutterstock Arlington, Virgina, was ranked the best city to retire to in the United States according to a new Bankrate.com survey.

The study took into account nine categories: cost of living, climate, health care cost and quality, taxes, crime, well-being, walkability and cultural vitality.

So which destination came in at No. 1? They found that Arlington, Virginia — near the nation's capital — is the best city to retire because of its cultural opportunities, great health care and a strong sense of well-being among seniors. While the high cost of living is the city's main drawback, the benefits of the other categories outweighed that downside.

And it's not just the East Coast that made the top of the list. Cities all over the country ranked in the top five. Franklin, Tennessee, came in second place, and West Des Moines, Iowa; Sarasota, Florida; and Scottsdale, Arizona, took the remaining spots.

“We found that smaller cities and suburbs fared the best,” said Bankrate.com analyst Jill Cornfield in a statement. “Most seniors prefer to live in these types of communities because they offer access to big-city amenities without as much hustle, bustle and crime.”

Where shouldn't you live as you grow older? According to the study, Niagara Falls, New York, is the worst place to retire. It was dragged down by high taxes, a cold climate and an above-average crime rate. Milford, Connecticut; San Bernardino, California; Troy, New York; and Worcester, Massachusetts, rounded out the bottom five.

While Bankrate's study looked at a variety of factors and focused on cities, an earlier survey conducted by caring.com ranked which states are the best for retirement based on health factors alone. In their findings, South Dakota ranked No. 1, with Iowa, Minnesota, Alaska and Oregon rounding out the top five. West Virginia came in last as is ""sorely lacking in important quality of life and health care offerings for seniors.""

http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/battling-dementia-mother-son-s-incredible-journey-n757196,nbcnews,Battling Dementia: A Mother and Son’s Incredible Journey,"['Becky Bratu', 'Mariana Keller']","You can still catch a few glimpses of the old Molly Daley, from before the dementia diagnosis two years ago, when she laughs for no reason, when she hugs her son and tells him she loves him, or when she pretends to box with her youngest grandson, wearing pink gloves and a padded helmet.

That’s the Molly who enjoyed drinking a cold beer with her dinner, going on road trips, and lending a hand to her friends and neighbors.

But that Molly is now elusive, more often replaced by a vacant gaze hiding the suffering as the disease slowly takes over her brain.

""That look of confusion, where she’s trying to process what’s going on, it’s just like a blank stare and that gets worse over time,"" her son, Joey Daley, told NBC News. ""It’s like, just a little bit, dementia has taken a little bit more of her away.""

Such is the agonizing nature of what's called ""Lewy body dementia,"" which Joey Daley began chronicling in January through a painfully honest YouTube series centered on his mom.

Molly, 66, was diagnosed in 2015, and Daley found himself yearning for more information from other caregivers like him about what to expect as the disease worsened.

When he found resources lacking, he decided to put the spotlight on Molly and their own family’s struggle — reaching the hearts of millions who have watched the videos around the world in the process.

“Before these videos, you couldn’t explain it to people,” Daley said, adding that he couldn’t watch his mother deteriorating without giving the ordeal some purpose.

Now, after the ongoing series sprouted a grassroots network of caregivers and supporters called Molly’s Movement, Daley, 46, said the videos have been the most rewarding thing he’s ever done.

""I had no idea it would touch that many people,"" he said.

Dementia with Lewy bodies is the second most common form of the disease in older adults after Alzheimer’s, affecting more than 1.4 million Americans. Abnormal clumps of a protein building up in brain cells cause the disease, which is characterized by a gradual loss of cognitive functions. Patients experience visual hallucinations, REM disorders that cause them to physically act out dreams, and tremors like those in Parkinson’s disease. But unlike Parkinson’s, Lewy body dementia affects wider swaths of the brain, interfering with a person’s everyday life and their ability to carry out typical activities or solve problems.

“I don’t want to stop early. I want people to understand how bad it gets.”

About three years ago, basic tasks like paying bills, driving a car or taking medication became challenges for Molly, who at the time was living alone in Columbus, Ohio. Then, after an infection landed her in the hospital, her children stepped in. She now lives closer to her family in a nursing home in nearby Dublin, where her son and daughter visit on alternate days, taking her out for shopping trips, the occasional pedicure or haircut, and family dinners.

Daley never knows what state of mind his mom will be in on each visit. Sometimes she’ll welcome him with a smile and small talk. Then there was the time he watched her using one toothbrush to brush another, having seemingly forgotten how to brush her teeth. Or the time she kept asking if the shower was a way out of the room.

But most often, he’ll find her crying, distraught and shaken up by a bad dream she is convinced actually occurred in real life, as she struggles to find the words to explain what she thinks is wrong.

Molly Daley and her son, Joey. Courtesy Joey Daley

""Dementia’s like an onion. You peel off the layers of the memory on the outer layers until you get to the core, where you’re just a child again,"" Daley said. ""It’s suffering to death.""

There is currently no way to prevent dementia or stop its advance. There is no ""cure."" And the only way to even get a definite diagnosis is through autopsy after a patient's death.

About one-third of all Medicare beneficiaries who die in a given year have been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s or another form of dementia, according to 2014 Medicare claims data analyzed by the Alzheimer’s Association. And data from the Lewy Body Dementia Association suggest that the disease may account for up to 25 percent of cases of dementia.

""[Lewy body dementia] is probably the most common disease you’ve never heard of,"" said Dr. James Galvin, an expert in cognitive health, memory loss, Alzheimer’s disease, Lewy body dementia, and related disorders.

Galvin said the disease is poorly understood and under-studied in comparison to Alzheimer’s, which is due in part to the difficulty in pinning down a diagnosis. A survey from the Lewy Body Dementia Association shows that on average, it took physicians four office visits to make the diagnosis. This lack of knowledge can isolate caregivers further.

“A caregiver is the invisible patient.”

To help combat that, Daley created a Facebook group that now has more than 31,000 members, many of whom are caregivers for people with dementia. They use the platform to share stories, seek advice and give out words of encouragement.

Periodically, Daley, who is an entrepreneur and works from home, uses the money earned from Molly’s Movement t-shirt sales or donations to organize giveaways for caregivers in the group. The prize is a relaxing night out or, in the case of a 16-year-old girl caring for her grandmother, a shopping trip.

""[The giveaway] is the type of thing my mom would do,"" he said, adding that he gets about 100 messages every day from people pouring their heart out to him or thanking him for his eye-opening videos.

Any type of support that reduces the feeling of isolation is essential, as caregivers can often forego their own needs when helping dementia patients.

“A caregiver is the invisible patient,” said Dr. Galvin.

But Daley, like many others, shrugs off concern for his own well-being. As his movement grows, so do the demands on his time. The married father of three said he will have to do ""more work when everyone’s asleep.""

His mother, who was a single parent of two while working two jobs as he was growing up, is his inspiration. One video at a time, he is building her legacy.

As his mother’s dementia gets worse, Daley wonders how much longer he’ll be able to keep recording, especially once she becomes unable to speak. He acknowledges that it will be a delicate balance, something he never got to discuss with her before beginning the series.

""I don’t want to stop early,"" he said. ""I want people to understand how bad it gets.""

Daley said the most exhausting part is going over what he recorded at the end of each day, reliving painful moments like the time she forgot he was her son — an event he thought would come much later, perhaps at the end.

But for the many heartbreaking moments, there are still the rare ones when the old Molly shines through, like when she was asked whether she is proud of her son.

""If there wasn’t a Joey, there wouldn’t be me,"" she answered."

As his “La La Land” colleagues were in the middle of speeches accepting the Oscar for best picture, it fell to the film’s producer, Jordan Horowitz, to interrupt and announce that a mistake had been made: “Moonlight” had actually taken the prize.

Surely, humiliation beckoned: Horowitz and his team now had to deal with handing over their awards in the most public forum imaginable, all while processing their disappointment in front of the cameras.

What followed, however, was a masterclass in grace under pressure.

Amid the confusion, with host Jimmy Kimmel suggesting that the “La La Land” team should keep their awards, Horowitz had to convince a baffled audience that a mistake had been made.

He urged the cast and crew of “Moonlight” to come onstage to accept their prize.

Still holding his statuette, he said: “I’m gonna be really proud to hand this to my friends from ‘Moonlight,’” a comment that elicited rapturous applause from the audience.

Horowitz’s handling of the situation won plaudits from those in the industry, and beyond.

Barry Jenkins, the director of “Moonlight,” led praise for Horowitz on Twitter.

Not everyone on social media was impressed with Horowitz’s conduct however, with a small but vocal minority accusing him of rudeness for grabbing the card announcing “Moonlight” as the best picture winner from actor Warren Beatty.

Horowitz later confessed that the situation was distressing.

“My heart was a little broken,” he said after the ceremony.

“I’m a little shaken about it. It’s disappointing, but ... I love that those guys got their moment and I love that I got to give it to them,"" he added.

Horowitz, a 36-year-old New Yorker, produced his first movie in 2010, and has since earned 13 producing credits and two writing credits.

Before the mainstream success of “La La Land,” his most high-profile endeavors were 2010’s “The Kids Are All Right,” which starred Annette Bening and Julianne Moore, and 2016’s “Miss Stephens.”

He has worked with his wife, Julia Heart, on multiple projects. The pair co-wrote “Miss Stephens,” as well as their next project “Fast Color,” which is currently listed as being in pre-production.

“La La Land” was Horowitz’s first Oscar nomination, but he has not left this awards season entirely empty-handed. He and his producing partners took best picture victories at Britain’s answer to the Oscars, the BAFTAs, as well as a Producer’s Guild of America award.

Though he didn’t get to walk away with a gold statuette on Sunday, Horowitz did get one thing that they can’t take away from him.

“I got to thank my wife and my son, so it’s all good.”"
http://www.nbcnews.com/business/retirement/worried-about-elder-financial-abuse-how-protect-your-parents-n559151,nbcnews,Worried About Elder Financial Abuse? How to Protect Your Parents,['Sharon Epperson'],"As your parents get older, roles sometimes reverse. You may find you now need to care for your aging parents, especially when it comes to managing and protecting their finances.

Elder financial abuse is a growing concern among seniors and their adult children. Sometimes family members and caretakers are the culprits. Just one financial scam can cost the average senior about $30,000 — a big hit for any nest egg. So how can you protect your parents' finances? Here are five ways to help.

1. Have the money talk.

It's often not an easy conversation to have, but it needs to happen — as soon as possible.

Ask your parents where they keep their money. Discuss when they would want you to step in and manage their day-to-day finances. To prepare, find out where they keep important paperwork, including wills and deeds, and who their financial, legal and tax professionals are. If they do not have a financial adviser, lawyer or accountant, talk to them about finding professionals who can work with all of you.

2. Watch for signs of trouble.

There may be signs that they are losing track of their finances. Keep an eye out for piled-up bills and notices from creditors. Check their bank account for suspicious activity, including significant withdrawals or unusual purchases. Also look for suspicious changes in their wills or powers of attorney.

3. Be on the lookout for scams.

Predators love to target the elderly, and they do it mostly over the phone. Educate your parents about potential scam tactics. Tell them to never give out money or information over the telephone.

Many scams begin with someone calling to inform you that you won something, like a lottery or sweepstakes. Another popular scam is someone posing from the IRS threatening to initiate legal proceedings for past-due balances.

To avoid unsolicited calls, encourage your parents to sign up for the Do Not Call Registry and the Direct Marketing Association's service to reduce junk mail. Remind them to never share their Social Security or Medicare numbers, and explain that the IRS only contacts individuals via regular mail for tax matters.

4. Make sure they know what they're signing.

Tell them to never sign a document that they don't understand. Have a trusted and unbiased professional assist your parents when they are entering contracts, signing legal documents, as well as making investment decisions.

5. Stay informed about potential frauds.

Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel helped craft the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare, and beginning with a meeting at Trump Tower in December, Emanuel has met with President Trump three times to discuss Obamacare’s effects on healthcare delivery. He's also the author of a new book which tackles healthcare reform, Prescription for the Future.

In the latest episode of 1947: The Meet the Press Podcast, Emanuel joined Chuck Todd to talk about how Obamacare might have been structured differently had anyone known that the Obama administration would be followed by the Trump administration.

On the consumer cost side, he points to a “mistake” that was made in crafting Obamacare.

In addition to the subsidies paid to people to buy insurance for themselves, Emanuel says that “cost-sharing subsidies” – money that goes to pay for deductibles and copays – weren’t given the same kinds of protections as the subsidies that pay for the insurance coverage. As a result, the cost-sharing subsidies are “open to annual appropriations rather than built-in as a kind of entitlement.“

In the years since the landmark law was passed, Republican opponents of the legislation have reduced the available funding for those subsidies, and the effect is that costs have risen for some families.

Emanuel believes that complaints about rising insurance premiums and decreasing coverage options could be fixed within the current legal framework. Some of the fixes are simple: enforce the mandate to buy insurance, target ads at young, healthy consumers, and bring back “risk-corridors” a kind of short-term insurance for insurance companies.

Taken together, Emanuel says, “those things will stabilize the market and actually bring the premiums down.”

Emanuel would also like to see the exchanges become a national market, instead of one that’s organized state-by-state.

“Partly we had it state by state because the Senate wanted it that way and we thought we might be able to get some Republicans to come aboard with state-by-state exchanges.” In the end, no Republican Senators voted in favor of Obamacare.

In meetings held during the transition period, and later at the White House, Emanuel says that he has tried to explain Obamacare to Trump, and to convince him to make changes to the system instead of scrapping it and starting fresh. After all, “healthcare is complicated.”

Of his meetings with the president, Emanuel is both cheerful and pessimistic. “It’s quite clear [Trump] does not get the nuts and bolts. But let’s be honest, very few Americans get the nuts and bolts.”"
http://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/daughter-nigerian-immigrants-finds-inspiration-trump-s-encouragement-n787671,nbcnews,Daughter of Immigrants Finds Inspiration in Trump’s Speech,['Shannon Clash'],"WASHINGTON — When President Donald Trump tried anew to reach out to young people following his much criticized speech to the Boy Scouts this week, his words connected with a daughter of Nigerian immigrants sitting in the crowd.

Trump congratulated the high school-aged participants in the American Legion Auxiliary Girls Nation and American Legion Boys Nation leadership programs on their scholastic achievements.

“Never quit. Never give up — always do what you love,” the president told the gathering in the Rose Garden on Wednesday.

“He believes in us and all the work that we put our hearts to,” Osaretin Ogbeide said.

The child of Nigerian immigrants, Ogbeide hopes to learn more about the American political system and, maybe, one day be a part of government.

Topics such as lowering the cost of living and education around health — specifically the opioid epidemic — are at the top of her list of changes.

“I want them to get the help that they need, to get the best education, to be aware of the rights that they have and liberties that are granted to them,” said Ogbeide, one of 100 state “senators” the American Legion Auxiliary sent to the national conference in Washington, D.C. this past week.

The young women attended senate sessions, learned about the creation of and debated diverse bill topics and polished their campaigning skills.

The girls created bills and resolutions including the Equal Service Act — which ensures that all persons are required to register and be included in the U.S. Select Service System. They also worked on measures that support veterans.

Alumni from the program include Kristen Soltis Anderson, an American pollster named on TIME magazine’s 30 Under 30 Changing the World; U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. Michelle D. Johnson, the first woman to lead the U.S. Air Force Academy; Jane Pauley, a TV journalist; Susan Bysiewicz, the former Connecticut secretary of state; Ann Richards, the former governor of Texas; and Susan Porter-Rose, former chief of staff to First Lady Barbara Bush.

Ogbeide, or “Oti” as she likes to be called, hopes to join their ranks.

“I think the girls who come to this program are informed. Whether or not we are in the [political] climate ... these are cream of the crop from each state. And they take it upon themselves to be knowledgeable about what’s going on around the world,” said Kirsten Baker-Geczy, a spokeswoman with the organization.

Ogbeide’s desire to lead in her community stems from her family’s message: if you want to see change, you have got to take part in it.

Twenty years ago, Ogbeide’s parents — a tourism and hospitality professor and a nurse — immigrated to the United States from Nigeria.

“They found each other, fell in love and began their start,” in the land of the free, Ogbeide said.

“My dad came here literally with 20 dollars in his pocket,” she said adding that her parents stressed the importance of a strong work ethic.

“My parents were very traditional,” Ogbeide said adding that they taught her to pound yams and make a soup called Egusi. “They wanted us to have a western upbringing but not forget where we came from.”

Ogbeide saw first-hand the challenges and adversity her parents faced toward gaining a better education and standard of living.

“To me being a first generation American is to combine both what your family has come from and also what you learned in America to combine those to become the best person you can be,” Ogbeide said.

Ogbeide said she was surprised to find she had so much in common with young women from across the country who have similar hopes and aspirations.

“I see all this passion, straight passion for policy, for government. I am not looking at you for how much money you make, how much money your family makes,” she said. “The color of your hair or your eye color or your skin color, the way that you speak, the way that you walk or your body.”

With New York City inundated by thousands of complaints each year about the furry critters, the Environmental Protection Agency recently approved New York state's access to this solid form of carbon dioxide — typically used to preserve food — as a way to suffocate them inside their holes.

Rat Ice, a product by Bell Laboratories, was added last month to the official pesticides list in New York state, making it legal to use on the burrowing rodents, said EPA spokeswoman Tayler Covington.

She told NBC News that dry ice can serve as ""another tool in efforts to control these pests.""

New York is one of a handful of large cities, including Boston and Chicago, that have tested dry ice in the past year.

The ice is shoved into a rat burrow and turns into carbon dioxide when it melts. The fumes then choke the animals and they are left to decompose, NBC Chicago reported.

Jim Fredericks, a senior entomologist at the National Pest Management Association, said his organization hopes the product will make it easier to control rats and mice.

""We've been in touch with multiple researchers who have been working on and with dry ice for rat control and the results have been great,"" he said.

Related: Rats Depress People More Than Crime Does, Study Finds

Fredericks explained that the technique is especially helpful in urban settings, where rats build nests underground in public parks. The availability of food debris and garbage left in those places compete with traditional baits that attract rodents, he added, making dry ice a more effective solution.

The state approval comes ahead of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's announcement Wednesday that he wants to spend $32 million to severely decrease the rat population using a variety of methods, including high-tech trash cans, NBC New York reported.

De Blasio is aiming to reduce the rat population by up to 70 percent in certain neighborhoods with the biggest broods. The rats in the city have long been notorious, but social media has made stars out of the ones that can schlep pizza slices or dinner rolls.

Subway rat hoards jumbo dinner roll https://t.co/5xEOTAkcWs pic.twitter.com/Gmdth9qMKc — NBC New York (@NBCNewYork) December 6, 2016

Last year, New Yorkers reported more than 17,200 rat sightings to the 311 hotline, according to The New York Times. So far this year, more than 10,000 complaints have been logged.

While dry ice is now permitted throughout New York state, the process is not widely approved and the substance is not on official lists of rodenticides for other states — forcing Boston and Chicago to discontinue its use.

Residents in Chicago, however, thought the method was effective after the city launched a pilot program last August. After it ended, however, rat complaints were up by 30 percent, NBC Chicago reported in May.

Both Boston and Chicago have pushed to get permission for their programs to be reinstated.

Boston's Inspectional Services Commissioner Buddy Christopher said the pesticide has its advantages.

""It's cheaper than poison — less likely a child or animal will ingest this,"" he told NBC Boston in December.

Covington said pesticide products must be properly labeled with instructions and precautions that explain how they're being applied.

But animal rights groups say cities should still consider nonlethal alternatives to dry ice.

Stephanie Bell, the senior director of cruelty casework for the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, told DNAInfo last fall that the method is harmful to rats, which she argued have the ""capacity to feel pain, fear, loneliness and joy, just as humans do.""

""Wild animals of any sort are attracted to places where there's a reliable food supply, and until that changes, the city will always find itself two steps back if it depends on killing,"" she said.

To reduce the rat population, she advocates the use of trash cans that are properly sealed and devices that emit high-frequency sounds that repel the creatures.

Too many people think of him as just Michael Jordan’s sidekick, not the guy MJ doesn’t win those titles without.

Which may be why Pippen, appearing on ESPN’s “The Jump,” had Kyrie Irving‘s back in his demand for a trade out of Cleveland.

“I am a very strong supporter of what he’s doing because I’ve watched what has happened to him in his career and how things went for him in Cleveland, and I think he’s at a superstar level now that he can control his own destiny. A lot of players in our game have that opportunity and they don’t take advantage of it. I think it’s the perfect timing, Cleveland didn’t win a championship, they were right there, but there’s been a lot of things going on within that organization. LeBron doesn’t give those guys the security that they need, that the superstar is gonna be there and he’s gonna support us and I see Kyrie looking at the opportunity to run before LeBron runs, because there’s a lot of chatter out there that LeBron’s coming to play with the Lakers.”

I believe Pippen starts to get at the heart of the matter. It’s not as much Kyrie Irving letting LeBron James “son” him or sharing the shots — it’s that Irving sees LeBron not being loyal to the Cavaliers and he decided to take matters into his own hands first. He has tried to control his own destiny (whether he should have or not is another discussion).

Pippen never faced a situation quite like this because Jordan was never leaving the Bulls in his prime (and I refuse to acknowledge the Wizards years as part of this). He admitted he wouldn’t have as many rings without Jordan, but more than most he gets why Irving may want out of the shadow of one of the greatest players ever."

“It showcased safe places for African Americans to travel during the times of segregation,” Dawn Dawson-House, director of corporate communications at the S.C. Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism and a key adviser to the newly revamped Green Book of South Carolina project told NBC News in a recent phone interview.

The book was created for motorists of the time told black people where they could sleep, eat and get gas including private homes, gas stations, clubs, beauty salons and hotels.

After an almost 30-year run with editions being issued for all 50 states, that publication ceased production, but recently it has been given new life as a mobile platform — The Green Book of South Carolina — for modern day Palmetto state travelers by the state’s African-American Heritage Commission.

During 2014, according to the South Carolina Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism, that industry had an economic impact of $19.1 billion.

“[One of the] number one industries in the state is tourism,” said Dawson-House. “And one of the things that draws people to the state is it’s authentic story; that’s why Charleston is so big and so many people know what Geechi and Gullah mean, because we’ve been promoting our authentic history and stories.”

Related: In Gullah: Things to Remember When Touring a Troubled Paradise

An integral part of that tourism business in addition to that authentic cultural story, are the vestiges of American slavery. According to the Charleston Visitors Bureau, between 40 and 60 percent of Africans brought to America to be enslaved came through parts of South Carolina and it is reported that African-American tourism contributes $2.4 billion to the state annually, up since the removal of the Confederate flag from the State House grounds.

Those enslaved people left an indelible mark not only on the culture, economies and shaping of that region and the state at large, but for the overall country as it stands today.

The new platform, which is available online as well as in app form, begins to tell that story, detailing and contextualizing over 300 historic points of interest across the state of South Carolina. And though not all of these locations are directly related to those enslaved peoples, that story is told.

“There are definitely attractions throughout the Greenbook, of course mostly in Charleston, that hint at the ‘Middle Passage’ and the hostile situation that slavery was,’ Dawson-House explained. “Like the Bench By the Road on Sullivan’s Island in Fort Moultrie where Africans were quarantined before being put on the auction block.”

In 2008, Nobel Peace Prize recipient Toni Morrison started her “Bench by the Road” project with a bench commemorating that spot. That bench makes it into the Green Book’s listing as well as other sites like the Slave Mart Museum, various Civil Rights sit-in locations and plantations.

“One good thing I like about a lot of the qualified plantations now is that they don’t just open up with a lord proprietor's declaration of who owned the plantation and his lineage,” Dawson-House said, name-checking the McLeod Plantation and Boone Hall. “Now they say, this brick structure was built by 700 slaves who came from Sierra Leone. You can see their fingerprints in the moulding and the brick. This is where their cemetery is and this is where you can find out all the information we are learning about them.""

The purpose, is simple: to continue telling stories that often get omitted and to preserve the legacy and contributions Black people have had on the state and country. “[It’s] really symbolizing the progress we’ve made, the culture we’ve created, the influence we’ve had, the contributions we’ve done -- all in one app that you can access through the devices that we all use today,” Dawson-House said.

According to her, the platform will continue to evolve. While there are preliminary plans to update the listing with other historic sites as they officially receive their historic markers, there is a desire to also include tourism-centric features like restaurants, festivals and places to stay.

“We hope that it serves as a catalyst for something greater,” Dawson-House said, pointing out that currently everyone working on the project is a volunteer. “If this truly does drive more traffic and more tourism in South Carolina, it makes it easier for people to recognize why they should invest in it.”

The drug, called Dupixent, is a twice-a-month injection under the skin. Patients can do it at home. It’ll cost $37,000 a year but the drug’s makers, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi, have stressed that’s the wholesale price and make a point of saying there will be programs to help people pay for it.

It’s approved for people with atopic dermatitis, a catchall term for itchy skin caused by allergy.

It can be very unpleasant.

“The cause of atopic dermatitis is a combination of genetic, immune and environmental factors. In atopic dermatitis, the skin develops red, scaly and crusted bumps, which are extremely itchy,” the FDA says.

“Scratching leads to swelling, cracking, weeping clear fluid, and finally, coarsening and thickening of the skin.”

There are many treatments out there now, from simple skin lotions to steroid creams and immune suppressant drugs like tacrolimus. But none of these works for everybody, and the immune suppressant drugs can raise the risk of cancers such as lymphoma.

“ People with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis cope with intense, sometimes unbearable symptoms that can impact them for most of their lives.”

Dupixent is for the hard-core cases that aren’t helped by anything else.

It’s a monoclonal antibody — a targeted immune system drug — that inactivates two inflammatory compounds called interleukin 4 or IL-4, and IL-13. “By binding to this protein, Dupixent is able to inhibit the inflammatory response that plays a role in the development of atopic dermatitis,” the FDA said in a statement.

Known generically as dupilumab, the drug can cause serious allergic reactions and eye inflammation. “The most common side effects include injection site reactions; cold sores in the mouth or on the lips; and eye and eyelid inflammation, including redness, swelling and itching,” the FDA notes.

The agency gave it both priority review and breakthrough therapy status, speeding it through the approval process.

Studies of about 2,000 people showed Dupixent injections resulted in clear skin or nearly clear skin for about two-thirds of those who tried it, and it reduced itching sharply in 40 percent.

""People with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis cope with intense, sometimes unbearable symptoms that can impact them for most of their lives,"" Julie Block, president and CEO of the National Eczema Association, said in a statement provided by the company.

“Of the adults with uncontrolled moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in the United States, it is estimated that 300,000 are most in need of new treatment options,” Regeneron said.

In a nod to the sensitivity around drug prices, the company stressed that there is no single price for the drug.

“The Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC) of Dupixent in the United States is $37,000 annually. Actual costs to patients, payers and health systems are anticipated to be lower as WAC pricing does not reflect discounts, rebates or patient assistance programs,” it said."

Portugal has boosted security ahead of the pontiff’s visit and has reinstated border controls restricting freedom of movement from other European states.

In a video message to the people of Portugal before his journey, Pope Francis said he would “present” himself to the Virgin Mary.

Visions of the Madonna are very important in the Catholic faith and the story of Fatima is universally known among Catholics.

What are the 'Three Secrets of Fatima'?

While grazing their sheep on May 13, 1917, Francisco and Jacinta Marto and their cousin Lucia dos Santos said they saw the first of several visions of the Virgin Mary who had three messages for the world.

Two years later, both of the Martos siblings died of influenza leaving Lucia to share the secret messages with the world.

At first, the children were not believed. But their visions were accepted as authentic apparitions by the Church in 1930.

According to the prophecies written down by Lucia, the first vision the children saw was one of hell and came with a call to prayer and conversion, which if not heeded would lead to another world war.

The second was that Russia would “spread her errors” throughout the world if people did not turn to God.

It wasn’t until 2000 that the Vatican disclosed the long-awaited third secret, describing it as a prediction of the 1981 assassination attempt of Pope John Paul II.

John Paul II had credited the Virgin Mary with saving his life and one of the bullets fired at him was placed in the crown of a statue of her in Fatima.

Lucia died in 2005 and is currently on the track for beatification, the first step towards becoming a saint. However, the process could not start until after her death."

Italy and Romania are fighting off the worst outbreaks, which can be entirely blamed on low vaccination rates, WHO said.

""The most recent fatality was a 6-year-old boy in Italy, where over 3,300 measles cases and two deaths have occurred since June 2016,"" WHO said. The boy had leukemia. Kids with cancer are especially vulnerable to infectious diseases such as measles, which is one of the reasons public health agencies urge everyone to vaccinate their children.

""Several other countries have also reported outbreaks; according to national public health authorities, these have caused 31 deaths in Romania, one death in Germany and another in Portugal,"" WHO added.

Romania has also had more than 3,000 cases in the past year, WHO said.

Related: Measles Vaccines Prevent More Than Just Measles

Earlier this year, Italy made measles vaccines mandatory for kids to go to school — one of the policies that keeps vaccination rates high in the United States. But unlike in the United States, Italy has added a fine of as much as $8,000 for parents who fail to vaccinate their children.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that U.S. travelers make sure they are up to date on measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccines before they leave the country. Measles has been eliminated in the United States, but there are still occasional outbreaks caused by travelers who bring the virus with them and infecting unvaccinated or undervaccinated people.

“ Measles remains a leading cause of death among children worldwide, and unfortunately Europe is not spared.”

Minnesota is counting down to the end of an outbreak that infected 78 people this year. Once two incubation periods are up without any new infections — at the end of this month — the state can declare its outbreak over.

Minnesota's outbreak was fueled by a huge drop in vaccination influenced by vaccine critics who targeted the Somali immigrant community.

Vaccine critics have also helped lower rates in Italy, the country's health authorities say. Vaccination rates fell from 90 percent in 2010 to 85 percent in 2015.

""Every death or disability caused by this vaccine-preventable disease is an unacceptable tragedy,"" said Dr. Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO's regional director for Europe.

""We are very concerned that although a safe, effective and affordable vaccine is available, measles remains a leading cause of death among children worldwide, and unfortunately Europe is not spared,"" Jakab said. ""Working closely with health authorities in all European affected countries is our priority to control the outbreaks and maintain high vaccination coverage for all sections of the population.""

Europe has been struggling to control measles for years. One of the worst recent years was 2013, when there were more than 10,000 cases across Europe. From July 2014 to June 2015, there were 4,224 cases, most of them in Germany, and 1,818 cases were reported from summer 2015 to July 2016.

The worst recent year in the United States was 2014, when there were 667 cases of measles. So far this year, the CDC reports 108 measles cases in the United States.

Experts say that to control measles, 95 percent of the population must be vaccinated or immune because of a past infection. Measles is one of the most infectious viruses — it infects 90 percent of people who are exposed to it if they aren't immune, and it can hang in the air and infect people who enter a room as long as two hours after an infected person has left.

WHO says measles killed 134,200 people worldwide in 2015. But vaccination campaigns have caused a 79 percent drop in measles deaths since 2000.

""During 2000-2015, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 20.3 million deaths, making measles vaccine one of the best buys in public health,"" WHO says."

Phillips, 43, whose execution had been postponed six times, was killed with a three-drug formula that has become popular with states struggling to obtain execution chemicals.

It includes a sedative that has been featured in several other executions that did not go as planned, though there were no reports of complications in Phillips' case. Media witnesses said it was far different than Ohio's last execution, in which the inmate gasped and heaved and took 26 minutes to die.

""It was too easy,"" Renee Mundell, half-sister of victim Sheila Marie Evans, told reporters after Phillips was pronounced dead at 10:43 a.m.

Phillips apologized to Sheila Marie's family for his ""evil actions,"" according to NBC affiliate WKYC, which had a reporter in the witness room.

""All those years, I prayed you'd forgive me and find it in your heart to forgive and have mercy on me. Sheila Marie did not deserve what I did to her. I know she is with the Lord and she suffers no more,"" he said.

Phillips' attorneys said in a statement that while he committed an ""unspeakable crime"" in 1993, at the time of his death he ""did not in any way resemble that troubled and broken teen.""

""He had grown to be a good man, who was thoughtful, caring, compassionate, remorseful, and reflective. He tried every day to atone for his shameful role in Sheila's death. In the past years, Ron has studied for and earned his certification to be a minister, and was preparing his first sermon.

""Ron's case suggests we should thoughtfully reconsider our laws that permit the harshest punishment for those who committed their crimes as teenagers, especially the irrevocable punishment of death.""

Phillips spent the night before the execution in prayer, officials said. He saved unleavened bread from his last meal of pizza and cheesecake and used it as communion shortly before the execution.

Ronald Phillips has been executed. Please pray for him, his family, the family of Sheila Marie Evans, and an end to all forms of violence. — Sister Helen Prejean (@helenprejean) July 26, 2017

The execution was witnessed by Sheila Marie's half-sister and two other relatives. The little girl's mother, Fae Evans, was sentenced to 13 years in prison for involuntary manslaughter and died of cancer in 2008. Phillips' brother was also present, and the execution was briefly delayed so they could meet.

Ohio's last execution was in January 2014 when murderer Dennis McGuire appeared to struggle for breath and took far longer to die than usual after being given an untested combination of drugs.

After his family sued, the state abandoned that protocol. It switched to the three-drug injection last year, but Phillips' execution was held up when a federal judge ruled that one of the components, the sedative midazolam, might contribute to a cruelly painful death.

An appeals court overturned that decision, and the U.S. Supreme Court turned down Phillips' request for a stay of execution late Tuesday, paving the way for his lethal injection hours later.

Phillips would have been executed in 2014 but Gov. John Kasich granted him a temporary reprieve to consider whether he should be allowed to donate his organs to relatives. Instead, the state executed McGuire next.

Ohio has planned executions for 26 inmates, stretching all the way to 2020, though some of those are sure to be postponed. The next one to face the needle is Gary Otte, scheduled to die Sept. 13.

Executions hit a historic low last year, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, which opposes capital punishment. Phillips was the 15th prisoner executed this year."

He’s going after the carnivores — and the meat industry that serves them red, bloody, marbled meat.

The scientist and chief executive behind the plant-based burger from Impossible Foods, Brown doesn’t particularly care that vegetarians and vegans rave about its flavor. He’s on a mission to recreate the texture, smell, and flavor of meat that carnivores crave — while cutting down on the waste in meat production.

“These yeast are making a protein that’s naturally made by soybean roots,” said Brown, motioning to strains of yeast in various tubes. “You can see, maybe, some of them are redder than others,” he pointed out to NBC’s Jo Ling Kent on a recent tour of the Impossible Foods Silicon Valley lab and test kitchen.

That protein is heme, and it’s what Brown calls “the magic ingredient” in his plant-based burger. The burger’s other ingredients are wheat, potatoes, coconut oil, some soy, xantham gum, amino acids, and a few vitamins.

The Impossible Burger is comprised of wheat and potato protein, vitamins and amino acids, coconut oil, soy protein, xanthan gum and the ""magic ingredient"" heme, which gives the Impossible Burger its ""meaty"" flavor. Chiara Sottile / NBC News

Combine those ingredients with heme — made from genetically modified yeast — and, in Brown’s words, “Voilà, a burger.”

The “magic ingredient” not only gives the burger a reddish color, but also is responsible for its “meaty” flavor.

The flavor of a meaty burger is actually a reaction in our mouth with the fats naturally present in our saliva that produces aroma molecules that smell and taste like blood. Impossible Foods has engineered heme to catalyze that chemical reaction, so that diners biting into this plant-based burger perceive the same bloody flavor.

Scaling Up Production of Plant-Based “Meat”

The burger currently costs about the same as ground organic beef, and is not available in supermarkets. But the company plans to expand production as fast as the science can keep up — starting with bringing the burger to more restaurants across the country.

During NBC's visit, Brown and his lab staff were working to optimize strains of yeast to “produce insane amounts of heme” — all part of Impossible’s vast expansion plans.

The Impossible Burger debuted in a few restaurants in the summer of 2016, and recently broadened into the Umami and Hopdoddy restaurant chains — bringing the total number of locations to 33.

The company has also just unveiled a more than 66,000-square-foot production and distribution facility in Oakland, California.

“We’re scaling up rapidly,"" Brown told NBC News. ""We’re going to increase our production from thousands of pounds [of plant-based “meat”] a month to more than a million pounds a month by the end of the year. We’re not gonna stop until basically we’ve accomplished that goal.”

Impossible Foods CEO Patrick Brown mixes all the ingredients that make up the company's plant-based burger in the company's Silicon Valley test kitchen Chiara Sottile / NBC News

In the Impossible Foods lab and test kitchen, Brown and his team of 160 are dedicated to ensuring that scaling up their product doesn’t harm its quality — which means ongoing testing. Lab staff in white coats, masks and goggles conduct blind experiments into how the “meat” forms in one’s hands as compared to ""real"" beef.

But, Brown says, beef is only the beginning. The company seeks to replace all animals, in addition to fish and even dairy products, with Impossible’s methods. Its food scientists can already create chicken, pork, fish and yogurt entirely from plants.

‘Disrupting’ the Cow for the Sake of the Planet

Brown says the Impossible Burger requires just 5 percent of the land needed for meat from a cow, produces 12.5 percent of the greenhouse gases, and uses only one-quarter of the water.

“Right now, the use of animals as a food production technology occupies about half of every square inch of land on earth,” said Brown in his company’s test kitchen. “It uses and pollutes more water than any other industry.”

But Brown knows that people love their meat.

According to the OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook, the global consumption of meat has spiked 21 percent over the last two decades, to 68 million tons a year.

""For billions of people around the world, meat is not only an important source of nutrition, it’s an essential part of the pleasure of life,” said Brown. “It’s completely unrealistic to think that we can ask them to give it up.”

So instead of asking meat lovers to abandon their food of choice, Brown was determined to figure out a better way to make meat that will please their palettes. In short, to use a Silicon Valley term, he is disrupting the cow.

“You think that the best possible way to make a food that delivers what consumers value in meat is to, you know, grow up a cow and kill it and chop it into bits. But in fact, when you think about it in terms of flavor, affordability, and nutrition, there are much better ways to make it,” said Brown, walking past an instrument that analyzes the aromas of individual molecules.

Meatless Burger Draws Crowds at Cockscomb Restaurant

Celebrity Chef Chris Cosentino, known for his whole animal cooking and love of meat, has been serving the Impossible Burger at his San Francisco restaurant, Cockscomb, for more than six months.

“I never thought anything like that would exist in my lifetime,” said Cosentino, who serves the burger for huge lunchtime crowds.

“Take your fingers and rub ‘em together, and you feel the fat on it. Right?” said an enthusiastic Cosentino in his Cockscomb kitchen, admiring the meatless burger patty he just formed. “It has the feeling texturally of ground beef. And it has that fat content on your fingers of ground beef.”

Cosentino is emphatic that he serves the burger because it’s the right thing to do for the planet — his kids and his grandkids included — but also because it’s the closest vegetarian option to beef he’s ever tasted.

“I’m 100 percent adamant about only serving what tastes great,” says Cosentino, grilling the burger with a satisfying sizzle and adding lettuce, Gruyère cheese, caramelized onions and pickles.

“I’m not gonna serve my customers a gimmick,” he says, inserting an “IMPOSSIBLE” flag on a toothpick into the bun as the last touch.

During this lunch service, most Impossible burger-eaters at Cockscomb said they could taste the difference between the plant-based burger and its meaty counterpart, but said the taste is so close, they were happy to eat the more environmentally friendly option.

“The excitement from the customer base, it’s just been nonstop. [They] want more, want more, want more,” said Cosentino, noting many patrons will come to his restaurant especially for the burger.

Brown says his company is ready to keep up with demand — as well as the company's ambitious expansion goals. Asked about his master plan, he replied: “Make a better product, let the market operate, and let’s see who wins.”"

As summer begins, signaling peak time for insect stings, allergists across the U.S. are warning of a shortage of a little-known but crucial product — honeybee, hornet and wasp venom extracts used in shots that prevent life-threatening reactions.

Supplies of the extracts — which are made from venom gathered by hand from millions of individual insects — have been scarce since October. That’s when one of two manufacturers in the U.S. shut down production after contamination problems. Doctors say they hope the situation will be resolved, but that’s not likely before next year. For now, they’re rationing doses for patients who need them most.

Getty Images Most people who are allergic to bee stings carry portable EpiPens to quickly counteract symptoms. But a smaller number use what’s known as venom immunotherapy.

“It’s going to be a rough summer,” said Dr. David Golden, an allergy expert and associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University.

Golden estimates he’s seen a 25 to 35 percent drop in the supply of venom extracts aimed at preventing dozens, perhaps hundreds, of deaths in the U.S. each year. Between 1 and 3 percent of the country’s adult population — up to 7.4 million people — may have systemic reactions to insect stings, and a smaller proportion have life-threatening responses, experts say.

Most of those vulnerable people carry portable epinephrine — often EpiPens — to quickly counteract symptoms. But a smaller number use what’s known as venom immunotherapy, or VIT, to dramatically reduce the risk of reactions. The treatment, authorized for nearly 40 years, injects small doses of venom under the skin to reduce sensitivity to the allergens that can trigger dangerous symptoms.

“It’s one of the few things that allergists do that actually save lives,” said Dr. Stephen Tilles, a Seattle allergist who is president of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI). “It’s about 98 percent effective.”

'Trying to stretch the venom'

The shortage started last fall, whenALK Laboratories of Denmark shut down production of six types of venom proteins — honeybee, wasp, white-faced hornet, yellow hornet, yellow jacket and “mixed vespid,” a cocktail of venoms.

The move followed a 2016 letter from the Food and Drug Administration citing problems with microbiological contamination. ALK officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.

That left only Jubilant HollisterStier, a Spokane, Wash., company that also produces venom extracts. HollisterStier ramped up manufacturing, Golden said, but the firm couldn’t supply enough venom extract fast enough to avoid a shortage. Firm officials declined to comment.

“Most allergists are having to seriously limit what they use,” Golden said. “We’re trying to stretch the venom that we have.”

This spring, Golden and colleagues issued recommended guidelines for rationing venom during the shortage. They called for spacing out doses at longer intervals, cutting maintenance doses, minimizing venom waste — and stopping treatment for patients at lowest risk for severe reactions.

Waiting between shots

So far, the plan appears to have worked, said Dr. Sandra Hong, an allergist with the Cleveland Clinic. Most patients do fine with shots at longer intervals; instead of every four weeks, they get them every three months. And after three to five years of treatment, many can be weaned from the venom with no ill effects.

“With all the things the allergists have done, it has decreased the shortage,” Hong said.

There have been a few reports of allergists who couldn’t get supplies of venom, and patients who couldn’t get the product, which costs about $70 for induction doses and about $20 for each maintenance dose. So far, there are no known cases of adverse events in patients who couldn’t get shots. There’s also no sign of the skyrocketing drug prices that have occurred with other products in short supply.

Still, allergists worked to ensure that patients at the highest risk weren’t harmed. That includes people like Ciro DeMarco, 58, a retired machinist from Moxee, Wash.

DeMarco nearly died in 1983 after he was stung by a honeybee while riding a motorcycle near a river in rural eastern Washington.

“I started feeling real strange,” he recalled. “I stopped the motorcycle and sat down. All of a sudden, I had no sight and I was almost unconscious.”

He lived in fear of another sting until about 10 years ago, when he learned about VIT. Now he gets regular venom shots every three months and takes over-the-counter allergy medications before he climbs onto his Harley-Davidson. He’s relieved that the shortage hasn’t affected his supply.

“Every spring I worry about it,” he said. “But I’m not going to quit riding just in case I get stung.”

ALK Laboratories may resume production soon and the shortage could be eased in coming months. Once the supply question is resolved, Golden said, he hopes to tackle a larger issue: lack of VIT awareness among people who’ve had a bad reaction to an insect sting.

“No more than 10 percent of the affected people have sought medical attention,” he said. “Problem No. 1 is that many people, including doctors, don’t know venom immunotherapy exists.”

According to BCC Research analyst Natana Raj, Americans shelled out more than $43 billion on sleep aids and sleep tech in 2016, and that number is on the rise.

ResMed S+ Sleep Sensor - $129.99

If you want to track your sleep, but don't like the idea of wearable device like a Fitbit, then the ResMed S+ is a great option. Once you aim the tall rectangular device towards yourself, it tracks breathing and body movements to analyze how well you're sleeping.

With its companion app, it then offers a ""sleep score,"" graph showing when it thinks you were in deep, light, and REM sleep.

The tracking technology is based on ten years of research by the ResMed team, and, after our testing, it seems to have mostly paid off. It did a good job figuring out when we were in bed, and the sleep analysis seemed to reflect how rejuvenating (or not) sleep felt.

ResMed

The app tries to offer feedback, too, though some of it is common sense - like taking a bath to relax before sleep and getting more exercise. The device is reliant on the app and Bluetooth connectivity to your phone, and in our testing, it became unpaired after a few nights. It was easy to pair it again, but having to troubleshoot Bluetooth before bed isn't exactly relaxing.

It also monitors the conditions in your bedroom - like temperature, light, and noise level - in case those factors could be keeping you from your ideal sleep.

The company notes that ResMed technology will soon be integrated in a new sleep tracker from SleepScore Labs, so keep an eye out for that later this summer if you can wait.

BEDDI Glow Smart Alarm Clock with Wake Up Light - $79.99

Also vyiing for space on your nightstand, BEDDI Glow from WITTI is an alarm clock that can wake you up naturally with a simulated sunrise. The light is customizable in any color you could possibly want, and can gradually increase its glow for up to 30 minutes before your alarm time.

You can download their companion app and pair your BEDDI Glow alarm with music from your smartphone, the radio, or services like Apple Music and Spotify.

It's an attractive bedside companion with thoughtful additions like traffic and weather updates at the press of a button - though just with a computerized voice that's reliant on your smartphone.

As smart alarm clocks go, BEDDI Glow is a good choice for a much gentler and more customizable wake-up than the blaring of an alarm from a smartphone.

Smart Nora Snoring Solution - $299

If you or the person who shares your bed is a snorer, think of the Smart Nora as the improved, high-tech version of prodding them to get them to switch positions.

The device has two parts: an electronic sensor that looks like a white computer mouse that sits on your nightstand, aimed in your direction, and an inflating pillow insert attached to a fabric case. When the sensor ""hears"" snoring, the sleeve under the pillow inflates. The idea is that the movement of the pillow will stimulate the relaxed throat muscles that cause the snoring and then allow for natural breathing to resume.

In testing, the Smart Nora did seem to decrease the frequency and volume in our house's snorer - making for a more restful night for everyone. We found the device's 30 minute delay option particularly useful, because if not engaged, Smart Nora would interpret pillow talk as snoring and start the inflating and deflating. And a rising and falling pillow is not exactly a mood setter before bedtime. Plus, while Smart Nora is described as ""silent,"" we could amost always hear a gentle inflating noise (when we were awake).

Aesthetically speaking, some might be bothered by the plastic tube that extends from beneath the pillow since it does give the Smart Nora the look of a medical device (which it is not). You can hide the device's boxy kit under the bed, but there's no easy way to disguise the tube.

This pillow has built-in speakers, a sleep tracker, and it's comfortable, thanks to being filled with memory foam. Rem-Fit

Zeeq Smart Pillow from Rem-Fit - $299

This pillow is really trying to do it all, which is probably at least part of the reason why it costs so much (for a pillow). One of its most attractive features of the Zeeq Smart Pillow is its ability to play sound that's audible only to the person whose head is resting on the pillow, not his or her bed companion. This could be great for a couple where one partner likes to fall asleep to music or an audio book, but the other needs silence. In testing, it delivers on this ability for music or for an alarm.

Despite the fact that the pillow has multiple speakers, a gyroscope, a battery and a microphone inside it, it's comfortable thanks to being filled with (purple!) pieces of memory foam.

Zeeq also promises to stop snoring with its embedded microphone and two vibrating motors that buzz when snoring is detected. We found the inflation of the Smart Nora more gentle than the buzz of the pillow, but this inevitably varies by the individual.

Like the S+ sleep tracker from ResMed, Zeeq also has a companion app and is marketed as a sleep tracker. But, the tracker relies on motion detection by the pillow, unless you spend more on a sleep monitoring strap that collects heart rate and respiratory rate information.

With any device promising to give detailed information about how well you are sleeping, most sleep experts say not to hang your hat on the sleep scores they offer.

""If one's using it hoping to find, 'Oh, I'm getting this much deep sleep versus REM sleep,' there they're not quite as accurate,"" said Dr. Shelly Zak of the Sleep Disorders Center at the University of California at San Francisco. ""Use them as sort of a general guide, but not as a specific measure,"" she advised.

Athlete Recovery Sleepwear from Under Armour - $60/garment and up

Under Armour is getting in on the sleep game, too, by printing what they call bioceramics on the inside of the fabric of their garments. According to the company, this fabric can absorb body heat and reflect it back as far-infrared energy.

The company points to studies from the National Institute of Health that show positive impacts of far-infrared energy on recovery - things like helping your body restore muscles while you rest.

In testing, the pajamas were very comfortable, but it's hard to really put a finger on whether we felt particularly restored (or any different at all) when we woke up.

According to Dr. Zak, further study would be needed to really prove that pajamas can actually improve sleep quality. ""It's intriguing,"" said Zak. ""But they would need larger studies and more controlled studies to really make an assessment of whether or not it's efficacious,"" she said.

Of course, there are plenty of free options for improving your sleep — no gizmos required.

Doctors say basic changes like minimizing noises from your sleep environment (especially those you might not think of, like an air conditioner clicking on in the middle of the night and waking you up) can make a huge difference. And, try to stick to a regular sleep schedule and spend a minimum of an hour relaxing or ""winding down"" before bed."
http://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/how-you-handle-confrontation-may-help-you-make-more-money-ncna786031,nbcnews,Are you a hawk or a dove? How you handle confrontation may help you make more money.,[],"Subscribe Let our news meet your inbox. SIGN UP

Last month, I was unexpectedly and harshly confronted by someone who completely misunderstood me. My fight-or-flight impulse had been ignited, my heart rate shot up and I began to sweat profusely while just reading a text that offended me.

My physical reaction to this made me think about how I can't stand confrontation. I try to careful about choosing my words when asserting myself in favor of some semblance of harmony. Yet, everyone handles the art of confrontation quite differently. Some even seem to actively seek confrontation — and even seem to get a charge out of it.

In trying to understand the physiological and emotional differences between those avoid confrontation like the plague and those who thrive on it, I came across a compelling recent study published in Hormones and Behavior that hypothesizes how testosterone levels may play a part in status-seeking behaviors, such as social dominance (confrontation) and competitive behavior. Referring to this difference in approach to confrontation as the ""hawk strategy"" versus the ""dove strategy,"" participants took part in a two-person economic decision-making game where what they earned depended on certain strategies and choices. As it happens, the person who went with the hawk strategy, when up against someone who went with the dove strategy, most often enjoyed a greater financial pay-off. But yet, when hawk went up against hawk, it resulted in the “worst financial outcomes” for all involved.

When it came to determining why some chose to go with the hawk strategy while others chose the dove strategy, researchers discovered that hawk strategists presented with higher levels of testosterone (a hormone more dominant in men) and less cortisol (an anxiety-linked stress hormone), affirming that when it comes to confrontation, sometimes an offense can really be the best defense.

Let’s take a step back and define the terms a little to wrap our minds around this outcome: Testosterone is a hormone class of androgens, present in both men and women, produced by ovaries and adrenal glands, to fuel your sex drive, keep your bones strong—even helps to balance your pain tolerance. Men with low testosterone levels may experience a diminished sex drive and erectile dysfunction. However, the hormone is not proprietary to the male gender. Women with low testosterone levels can also suffer from a decrease in sex drive, and even depression.

Cortisol, another equal-opportunity hormone fueled by the adrenal glands, also vacillates greatly in each of us at any given time of day. It works to fight inflammation and regulate water levels in your body. It’s also called the “stress hormone,” because your cortisol levels spike when you’re stressed out.

Though both testosterone and cortisol ebbs and flows through our bodies, and their levels can vary both at baseline levels and at any given time, it seems they can affect our personalities in very marked, yet different, ways. How do testosterone-fueled hawk strategists differ from cortisol-driven dove strategists differ in personality? And, as the study asks, do “hawks” have the upper hand in terms of earning power when going up against a “dove?”

In terms of personality types, clinical psychologist Dr. Michelle Golland defines hawks as those with high, logical intelligence, plenty of drive and intelligence, and are rather fearless and are active communicators, but they can also be blunt, pushy, stubborn and unsympathetic. In turn, she describes doves as emotionally intelligent, patient, giving, risk averse, and reliable, but passive with communication, gullible, dependent, followers and predictable.

Thusly, hawks might be better at confrontation because they are not afraid or anxious about being aggressive or standing up to someone or for something, explains Dr. Golland. “If you are a hawk personality, it may be more uncomfortable not to confront, per se, then to confront. Doves fear confrontation, in part, because they avoid risk-taking behaviors. Confronting someone, or even speaking up, is emotionally risky (for them) because it may cause people to disagree with them or not like them. For a dove personality, it may cause much more anxiety or stress producing to confront someone or something, then if they don’t.”

That said, looping back to the results of the study, these almost opposite, psychological profiles can also take very different approaches to their professional lives.

“Hawk-types might enjoy financial advantages because of their confrontational nature. For example, they would be better at asking their boss for a raise, and logically making a case for it, with much less anxiousness or fear then a dove-type person. When motivated and determined, hawks can push farther and harder for their needs than doves,” says Dr. Golland.

Are there any professional advantages to being a dove? There are many. For one, they can make for mighty negotiators in tricky, complicated situations where interpersonal skills can make or break the deal. “Some financial negotiations involve complex variables which may require a steady, patient, less risk-averse stance of a dove,” Dr. Golland says.

Just imagine a world where we could gage our hormone levels to ensure we’re best equipped to negotiate for a raise, talk colleagues off a ledge or even diffuse a misunderstanding. There’d be less lose-lose, hawk-against-hawk action for sure. And, just maybe, we'd all make a bit more money."

This week, TODAY's financial expert Jean Chatzky and nutritionist Joy Bauer share their top tips for grocery shopping the smarter and healthier way. Here are a few of Jean's tips for saving the most cash:

1. Make a list.

It sounds old fashioned, but if you know what you’re cooking that week — and you have an actual list — you’ll save money because you won’t buy things not on your list.

2. Pick one store — and get to know it.

The easiest way to leave the store with money still in your pocket is to shop just the perimeter and a few aisles. A study from the Marketing Science Institute found the more aisles you go down, the more unplanned purchases end up in your cart.

3. Have a snack before you go.

Don’t sample. I know your mother told you this and it’s true. Chewing gum and wearing headphones with your own playlist (not the store’s, which is designed to get you to dawdle) will also help you tune out the triggers stores put in place to get you to buy. Also, try to go alone so that no one eggs you to buy things you don’t need.

4. Anything non-perishable should be bought on sale.

Grocery stores work on cycles and every five or six weeks, things cycle on sale. For that reason, you don’t have to buy anything other than true perishables when they’re not on sale.

5. Be brand agnostic.

Because of the sale cycles, if you can be happy switching between brands of yogurt, hummus or types of apples, you can almost always get items on your list on sale. For example, one brand of yogurt is almost always on sale. If you don’t mind switching between Chobani, Oikos, Fage, etc., you can almost always get it for a discount.

6. Things you think are perishable don’t have to be.

Frozen fruits and veggies are cheaper — for example, a 12-ounce bag of fresh, microwave-in-bag string beans is $2.50 (on sale), while a 12-ounce bag of frozen microwave in bag string beans is $2.00 (on sale). If you wind up not using the frozen string beans when you were planning to, they won’t go bad. That’s a big savings. The average American household throws out $640 worth of food each year, according to the American Chemistry Council.

7. Download coupons to your loyalty card.

You certainly can clip coupons, but you don’t have to anymore. You can download them at coupons.com, couponmom.com, or redplum.com. Make sure to keep that loyalty card in your wallet or on your key ring. Then, photograph your receipt to get cashback through Ibotta.

8. Use the self-checkout.

According to a study from IHL Consulting Group, impulse purchases among women drop 32 percent and men 16 percent when self-checkout is used instead of a staffed checkout. The primary reason for the drop, according to the study, is that self-checkout devices are not as stacked with candy, gum and other merchandise as staffed lanes at most retailers. Additionally, there is usually a shorter line at each register, removing the captive audience with the tempting impulse items in front of them.

She had a focus on making her name in the theater — which provided a natural transition into storytelling.

Johnson, who is currently working on her fourth novel, is attracting many new readers with each book.

NBCBLK caught up with the author to talk about how she got her start, drawing from her own life in her storytelling, and how to write a page-turner. The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Sadeqa Johnson Mary B. Photography & Design / Courtesy of: Sadeqa Johnson

NBCBLK: How did you get into novel writing?

Sadeqa Johnson: I was always a big reader, In the summers I would go get seven books a week at library. The writing started when I was in the seventh grade and I wrote an essay called The Roof is on Fire. My teacher entered it into a contest and I won.

My interest in writing fluctuated over time, though. I started acting in Philadelphia, where I grew up. I went to college in New York as a theater major. And I took a playwriting class. Later I switched to communications. When I got out of college I got a job at Scholastic Books, in publicity. Being surrounded by books sparked my interest in writing again. I wrote plays, poetry, and screenplays.

The first of your three novels, Love in a Carry-On Bag took you a long time. Why?

First, I wanted to write the next Black love story, like Love and Basketball. I took some things from my real life and a long-distance relationship to help shape the story. It was my first book and it took me 10 years to get it done. I was doing full-time work, being a wife and mother, working on generating drafts, and figuring out structure all at the same time.

You self-published this first book. Why?

I was working in GP Putnam as a book publicist at the time. I thought I was connected, and that it would be easy to get a book deal when I was done. Traditional publishing had changed, making it harder for people to sell a book.

I decided to self-publish, because I had the background to get the book out there. The book went on to be the recipient of the 2013 Phillis Wheatley award for Best Fiction and the 2012 USA Best Book award for African-American fiction.

Second House from the Corner: A Novel of Marriage, Secrets, and Lies by award-winning author Sadeqa Johnson published February 14th, 2017. Courtesy of : A Thomas Dunne Book for St. Martin's Griffin; Reprint edition

You are now publishing traditionally. As an author, how do you find it different from your first experience?

This first book from St. Martins, ""Second House From the Corner"" was a different experience. I wasn’t responsible for the layout and some of the back-end work. Most of the time there is a social media person who works on spreading the word. And when you are with a traditional publisher, there is a sales team behind you.

But either way you still you are constantly shifting between writing and promoting. You must be just as involved. You are your best mouthpiece for your work.

What was the idea behind ""The Second House from the Corner""?

It is rooted in family experiences. It is also about what happens when family secrets come out of the closet. The main character, Bea is a stay at home mom with three small children. I am a mother with three kids so I relate to her. And much of the back story comes from stories that my grandmother told about living in Philadelphia. I folded some of them into the story.

You had a new novel released this April. Tell us about And Then There Was Me.

It is the first book I have written that doesn’t have a piece of me in it. I could see the characters though. The book is about two friends. And they surprised me. I remember writing a scene where the lead character, Bea, threw up.

And Then There Was Me: A Novel of Friendship, Secrets and Lies by award-winning author Sadeqa Johnson published April 11, 2017. Image: And Then There Was Me: A Novel of Friendship, Secrets and Lies by award-winning author Sadeqa Johnson published April 11, 2017. / Thomas Dunne Books

As it unfolded, I saw that she was bulimic I decided to explore that because we don’t really talk about eating disorders in the Black community. So I researched and talked to people in social media chat rooms to learn more.

Also, Bea is a surrogate, who is pregnant and living in an unhappy marriage. Because of some of the subjects in the book it really breaks through the color lines. And the thing that resonates most is the deep friendship between Bea and Awilda.

How would you describe the perfect reader for a Sadeqa Johnson book?

I really focus on writing the books that I love and want to read. Once the story hits me, I am looking for the character’s voice. I write character first, plot second.

I have a large group of readers, and there is a wide range. I have fans in their teens, and women who are retired. My books appeal to everyone. I want to write page turners. I really am a lover of language so I work hard on the words. I write characters that you know.

What’s next for you?

I am working on historical fiction this time around. I am still writing.

What kind of advice would you give to aspiring writers who also have stories they want to tell?

It takes discipline to keep your butt in the seat to write. I tell myself to use the time I have wisely. I keep a timetable and a schedule for my writing.

Debra Pyka of Hixton is seeking $5 million plus punitive damages, saying in a suit filed in U.S. District Court in Madison (PDF) that her son, Joseph Chernach, was suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) — a form of dementia — when he hanged himself in his mother's shed in June 2012 at age 25.

The suit claims Chernach suffered concussions leading to the dementia while playing in a Wisconsin-Michigan Pop Warner league from 1997 to 2000.

The suit names Pop Warner Little Scholars and the Pop Warner Foundation of Langhorne, Pennsylvania, and Lexington Insurance Company of Boston as defendants. Pop Warner and Lexington didn't answer or return calls seeking comment.

The suit was filed only eight days after Boston University researchers reported that former NFL players who played tackle football before age 12 — like Chernach — showed greater declines in memory and cognitive function when compared to peers who entered the game in their teens.

""The bottom line is that the findings are not a surprise, because there have been studies in boxers and those who participate in mixed martial arts showing that those who started under age 15 had more brain atrophy,"" Dr. Robert Cantu, medical director of the Sports Legacy Institute near Boston and author of ""Concussions and Our Kids,"" told NBC News last week.

Pyka's suit makes the same connection, alleging that Chernach suffered specifically from dementia pugilistica, also known as ""boxer's dementia"" and ""punch-drunk syndrome."" It cites research it says shows that football and boxing involve similar impact forces on the human brain, saying, ""The objective in both boxing and football is to the knock the opponent down.""

Concussions and their long-term effects on football players have become one of the most controversial talking points surrounding the U.S.'s most popular sport. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll last week found that 2 out of 5 U.S. parents would encourage their children to play a sport other than football specifically because of concerns about concussions.

Meanwhile, investigators in Ohio are looking into whether confusion from several concussions may have contributed to the suicide in November of Kosta Karageorge, a wrestler and walk-on football player at Ohio State University. The coroner ordered a special examination of Karageorge's brain because of his reported history of concussions.

NBC Sports: Youth Concussion Laws Pushed by NFL Lack Bite

Pyka's suit says Pop Warner should have known about research linking concussions to dementia and accuses it of negligently having allowed small children to play the game, hired amateur coaches and referees untrained to deal with concussions, failed to require the safest possible helmets, and failed to warn her and other parents of the risk of dementia, among other claims.

""Tackle football with helmets is a war game,"" the suit says. ""It is not only a 'contact' sport, it is a 'combat' sport. The game of tackle football is in essence a war between combatants, where the individual player is coached to do battle against his opponent by inflicting the maximum amount of physical punishment to the enemy player.""

Collins'],"A leading human rights organization is denouncing the incarceration of a rape survivor in El Salvador for homicide charges after she suffered a stillbirth.

“The sentence against a 19-year-old rape survivor of 30 years in prison on charges of 'aggravated homicide' after she suffered pregnancy-related complications, is a terrifying example of the need for El Salvador to urgently repeal its retrograde anti-abortion law,” Amnesty International said.

Evelyn Beatriz Hernández Cruz, 19, was afraid to report her rape; she did not receive medical care and was unaware she was pregnant when she went into labor.

Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International, said that “El Salvador’s anti-abortion law is causing nothing but pain and suffering to countless women and girls and their families. It goes against human rights and it has no place in the country or anywhere.”

El Salvador, which passed the anti-abortion law in 1988, is one of five countries in Latin America where abortion in all circumstances is illegal. The other ones are Nicaragua, Honduras, Dominican Republic and Chile. The criminalization of abortion pushes many women to jail, even those who suffer complications during pregnancy.

Sara García, a woman's advocate at the organization Colectivo Feminista in El Salvador, told the Associated Press there are over 25,000 women a year who became pregnant after rape.

Amnesty International states that some women in El Salvador have received 40-year sentences following miscarriages, obstetric emergencies or abortions.

“All women and girls imprisoned for having had an abortion or experiencing obstetric emergencies should be immediately and unconditionally released, and the law must be repealed without delay.” Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International.

The 2017 Norton Wi-Fi Risk Report released this week found that 92 percent of Americans have potentially put their personal information at risk while using public Wi-Fi. They’ve logged in to:

A personal email account: 62 percent

Social media account: 56 percent

Their bank account or accessed other financial information: 32 percent

Work email: 29 percent

Nineteen percent said they had entered personally identifiable information, such as their Social Security number or birthday, while logged in at a public hotspot.

Why take the chance of being hacked? It could be that people who do this don’t realize the risk. Nearly 70 percent feel their personal information is safe when using a Wi-Fi hotspot, yet 41 percent can’t tell the difference between a secure or unsecure public Wi-Fi network.

“There is a deep divide between what people think is safe when it comes to using public Wi-Fi versus the reality,” Fran Rosch, an executive vice president at Symantec, said in a statement. “What someone thinks is private on their personal device can easily be accessed by cybercriminals through unsecure Wi-Fi networks or even apps with privacy vulnerabilities.”

Americans are obsessed with staying connected and we depend on public Wi-Fi to make that possible. The Norton survey found that:

More than half (57 percent) of the respondents said they can’t wait more than a few minutes before logging on to a Wi-Fi network or asking for the password after arriving at a café, hotel, or friend’s place

Seventy-five percent said access to a strong free Wi-Fi network is a deciding factor when choosing a hotel. Forty-nine percent said that’s how they decide which restaurant, bar or café to go to.

Thirty-five percent have accessed a Wi-Fi network with the owner’s permission. Twelve percent actually guessed or hacked the password to get in.

Ten percent would be willing to share personal details or allow access to their contact list to get a strong, free Wi-Fi signal when they’re away from home.

Free Doesn't Mean Safe

Kevin Haley, director of Norton Security Response, told NBC News their research shows that many people believe companies wouldn’t offer free Wi-Fi if it weren’t safe. Unfortunately, that’s not the case. And it doesn’t take a sophisticated criminal to hack in to these public systems.

Keep in mind that requiring you to use a password to access that hotspot doesn’t mean the connection is secure. The purpose of a password is to limit who can use the network.

“It’s fairly easy for someone to listen in and capture your data when you’re on public Wi-Fi,” Haley said. “They can discover your log-in and password and also the data you’re sending and receiving.""

Even worse, they could be stealing this information and you’d never know it until something bad happens, such as unauthorized charges on your credit card or money withdrawn from your bank account.

Because it’s available to anyone, free public Wi-Fi, is inherently less secure than the wireless connection at your home or office. Cyber security expert Adam Levin, author of the book “Swiped,” said people need to understand this difference and act accordingly.

“Why would you want to go into a murky swimming hole where you don’t know if there’s an alligator there, if you can go into a pool where you can see the bottom and know there’s nothing dangerous waiting there for you?” Levin said.

Security Is Getting Better...Right?

It’s hard to change people’s behavior. The idea that they’re not going to walk into a coffee shop or airport and access a Wi-Fi hotspot is ludicrous. That’s why many popular websites, especially financial institutions, have taken steps to protect people from themselves, by using secure (HTTPS) connections that encrypt the data going back and forth.

“They’ve done this so that even when people access them in hostile environments, they’re protected from some of the lowest common denominator attackers sitting on an open-end Wi-Fi network and looking for victims, said Chad Thunberg, COO of Leviathan Security Group in Seattle. “So year-over-year, we are safer today when using public Wi-Fi than we were previously.”

Even so, Thunberg told NBC News, free hotspots are always “going to be dirtier” than a corporate or home Wi-Fi network. And there’s a new security problem most people aren’t aware of — apps.

When you access the web using a browser, you can check to see that it’s a secure connection by looking for https in the URL with a small green lock next to it. Apps, whether on a phone, laptop or other mobile device, don’t provide this level of transparency — no green lock, no URL to check.

Research done by Norton found that 38 percent of all apps don’t do anything to protect your data when they connect to a network.

“That means your passwords and all the data you’re sending via the app are being sent in the clear,” Haley said. “Anybody intercepting it can see it; it’s not encrypted. So there’s certainly a risk there.”

Are Virtual Private Networks the Solution?

One of the best ways to protect your information when you use public Wi-Fi to go online is to use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) from a trusted provider. A VPN creates a “secure tunnel” that encrypts everything that’s sent and received between your device and the Internet, including log-in information.

Most of the people (76 percent) surveyed by Norton know about VPN technology, but only 27 percent of them use a VPN to protect their personal information.

Chester Wisniewski, principal research scientist for the cybersecurity firm Sophos, wouldn’t think of logging on to the internet when he’s away from home without using a VPN. He says a VPN may slow things down by a few seconds, but the advantages greatly outweigh the downsides.

""VPN services provide a protection both from criminals capturing your Wi-Fi signal and malicious network operators. Remember, anyone can name their Wi-Fi ""Starbucks"" or “Marriott” and you might feel safe,” Wisniewski told NBC News. “While VPNs aren't a silver bullet to all security and privacy concerns, they go a long way toward ensuring the integrity of your internet access while taking advantage of ever more ubiquitous free public Wi-Fi.""

They beat up on females for no apparent reason, biting them hard enough to make them bleed and harassing them in general.

A male baboon displays his canines. Alecia Carter

And this bullying seems to pay off. The aggressive male baboons were more likely to mate with their victims when they became fertile, researchers reported Thursday.

They say their findings add to growing evidence that sexual aggression may be hard-wired into our genes. It's only one small piece of the puzzle, but the researchers say understanding the roots of such behavior can help explain why it's so common among people.

""Sexual violence occurring in the context of long-term heterosexual relationships, such as sexual intimidation, is widespread across human populations,"" the team wrote in their report, published in the journal Current Biology.

But do people do this because we are unique? Is it a product of our emotions or morals, or perhaps a result of how children are raised? Or does it come from deep in the DNA?

Thursday's study adds a little evidence to the idea that human sexual violence lies in our genes.

That's because humans and baboons are related, coming from a common ancestor that lived tens of millions of years ago.

A different study, published in the same journal in 2014, found that sexually aggressive chimpanzee males were not only more likely to win mating rights, but to actually father offspring — presumably spreading their sexually aggressive DNA even more broadly.

Very little work had been done with more distantly related primates, so Alice Baniel of the Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse and colleagues studied two troupes of baboons living in Namibia.

“ When I was in the field and observing the baboons, I often noticed that males were directing unprovoked attacks or chases toward females in estrus.”

They observed a lot of male aggression.

Fertile females came in for a lot more of it than pregnant females or new mothers did. Attacks by males were a major source of injury for fertile female baboons, they reported.

""When I was in the field and observing the baboons, I often noticed that males were directing unprovoked attacks or chases toward females in estrus,"" Baniel said in a statement.

""They also maintained close proximity and formed a strong social bond with one particular cycling female, from the beginning of their cycle until the end."" This type of behavior is called mate-guarding.

Related: Uber Investigates Sexual Harassment

The bullying paid off. A male who chased and beat up on a certain female over time was more likely to mate with her when she entered a fertile phase, the team found.

They called it ""a form of long-term sexual intimidation.""

It was not overt rape.

""We found no support for short-term sexual harassment: the probability of copulation did not increase in the five to 20 minutes following male aggression for either unguarded or mate-guarded females,"" they wrote.

Why does it matter? If such behavior is found in humanity's closest relatives — the chimpanzees — and other social primates, it suggests roots deep in evolutionary history, as opposed to behavior that has arisen recently.

""Because sexual intimidation — where aggression and matings are not clustered in time — is discreet, it may easily go unnoticed,"" Baniel said.

Related: Woman Catcalled 100 Times in Creepy Video

""It may therefore be more common than previously appreciated in mammalian societies, and constrain female sexuality even in some species where they seem to enjoy relative freedom.""

There's another factor — size. The behavior may be more common in species whose males are markedly bigger than females, such as chimpanzees, baboons and humans.

“ Sexual intimidation is widespread across human populations.”

Humanity's other close relative, the bonobo, doesn't have this sexual size difference, and bonobos are notoriously egalitarian when it comes to sex.

""This study adds to growing evidence that males use coercive tactics to constrain female mating decisions in promiscuous primates,"" Baniel said.

""Such behavior, previously reported only in chimpanzees, may therefore occur in a wider range of primates, strengthening the case for an evolutionary origin of human sexual intimidation,"" Baniel's team concluded.

Baniel plans to study the two troupes further. She's hoping at least some of the females stand up for better relationships.

""I would like to understand if several mating strategies could coexist among males, i.e., being chosen by females versus intimidating them,"" she said."

http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/make-your-vacation-little-smoother-these-handy-gadgets-n775226,nbcnews,Make Your Vacation a Little Smoother with These Handy Gadgets,['Andrea Smith'],"Traveling can be stressful enough with overcrowded flights and trying to find your way in unfamiliar surroundings. Running out of power for your phone or getting lost in a strange city should not be something you have to deal with. From suitcases that can find themselves, to ensuring you never run out of outlets for charging your devices, these gadgets and apps can help make your next trip just a little easier — and a lot more fun.

Portable Power

Today’s travelers never leave home without a smartphone, and usually bring along a tablet or laptop as well. Keeping all those devices powered up can be a challenge, so we recommend a few essential items.

Belkin’s Travel RockStar is a 3-in-1 device that plugs in to any AC socket and provides extra outlets and a USB port, if you’re in a hotel room with very few outlets. It’s also a surge protector and has a built-in 3000 mAh battery so you can charge your devices on the go.

Belkin's Travel RockStar is a 3-in-1 device that provides extra outlets and a USB port, for when you're in a hotel room with very few outlets.

If you’re bringing along a laptop, you know how cumbersome and heavy the power cords can be. And you can’t share unless everyone you’re traveling with has the same laptop. Universal laptop chargers are trying to ease that pain point. Dart by FINsix is about four times smaller than the standard power brick and provides an extra USB port, plus a six-foot cable for charging a phone or tablet. Dart will work with most major laptops, as it comes with nine interchangeable power tips, but we highly recommend checking their compatibility chart first to be sure it works with yours. There’s also a Dart-C version for USB Type-C laptops.

Schneider Electric has a universal APC laptop charger that’s a little less expensive than Dart’s. They work with most manufacturers but only come with the specific tips designed for your device. Again, check compatibility, but it’s nice to have a second charger in case you forget yours at home.

Mobile Wi-Fi

If you’re traveling out of the country, data roaming can get very expensive — and international phone plans limit you to one device and cap the data. For a less expensive way to post your travel snaps to social media and access Google Maps while you roam unfamiliar streets, rent a MiFi mobile hotspot from XCom Global. It’s a small device you carry with you that provides constant 4G/LTE connectivity. You can connect up to 10 Wi-Fi enabled devices so the whole family can use one connection for a flat rate of $7.77 per day with no data limit. The device is sent to your home the day before you travel and all you need to do is send it back in the pre-paid envelope when you return.

Comfortable Headphones

If you’re flying or traveling a long distance you’ll want to bring along comfy headphones to listen to your downloaded Netflix shows or drown out the sounds of the baby crying at the back of the plane. Plantronics BackBeat 500 is a wireless Bluetooth headset with 18 hours of battery life; great for long trips because it’s lightweight, and the soft memory foam cushions make it super comfortable to wear. It also comes with a carrying pouch and 3.5mm cable for connected listening in the hotel or on the go.

Track Your Luggage

Few things can derail your vacation fun more than arriving at your destination only to find your luggage is somewhere else — and no one is quite sure where. The BlueSmart One rolling suitcase has built-in GPS so you can track its location anywhere in the world via an app on your phone. It also has a built-in battery and two USB ports so you can charge up your phone if you used up all the battery on the plane, and an app-enabled lock. There’s a roomy outside pocket for a laptop and other electronic devices.

Track Your Travels

If you like keeping track of how many miles you walk while exploring a foreign city, make sure to bring along an activity tracker. The FitBit Alta HR is a wrist-worn tracker with a slim, attractive design so you can check your steps, distance, and calories burned to see if you walked off all those pastries and treats. It also sends call and text notifications right to your wrist so you don’t need to pull out your phone while you’re enjoying the sights. The heart rate and sleep tracker will be especially useful once you’re back home and trying to get over that jet lag.

Take Better Pictures

A camera built into your smartphone makes taking vacation pictures convenient and easy, but if you’re looking for more than a simple snapshot, take along the Olloclip Core Lens Set for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. It comes with three add-on lenses; Macro 15x, Fisheye and Super-wide so you can get up close and personal or pull back for gorgeous landscape shots. The lenses slip onto the top of the iPhone and can be used on either the front or rear-facing camera, great for selfie-loving tourists. The lenses fit into an included pendant stand that can also be used as a tripod.

These Olloclip lenses slip onto the top of an iPhone and can be used on either the front or rear-facing camera for all your selfie needs!

Work on the Go

We highly recommend NOT working while you’re on vacation, but for those times you absolutely must and only have your phone or tablet with you, the iClever Tri-Folding Wireless Keyboard with Touchpad will come in handy. It connects via Bluetooth to your mobile device, (iOS, Windows and Android) opens up to display a keyboard and built-in touchpad and folds back down to just about the size of your smartphone. It’s compact and portable and sure beats typing an entire document on a smartphone touchscreen.

Make Free Calls

For free calling from overseas, download the WhatsApp mobile app before you leave home. This is an extremely popular texting app used to call and message people in other countries. WhatsApp uses your phone’s internet connection instead of your plan’s voice minutes so you don’t have a cost per minute price tag. However, it does count against your data use so we recommend finding a cozy café that offers free Wi-Fi or using the hotel Wi-Fi to make calls home. That way they’re completely free, except for the price of the coffee.

Discover the City

If you love exploring new cities using public transportation, download Transit App, which provides real-time info for subways, buses, trains, even bike share options. Not sure how you want to get from point A to point B? The app uses your location and lets you know all available options, and how long each trip will take. Transit App works in over 125 cities in the U.S. and Europe."
http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/schools-rethink-lunch-policies-humiliate-kids-n779706,nbcnews,Schools Rethink Lunch Policies That Humiliate Kids,['Associated Press'],"Teaching assistant Kelvin Holt watched as a preschool student fell to the back of a cafeteria line during breakfast in Killeen, Texas, as if trying to hide.

""The cash register woman says to this 4-year-old girl, verbatim, 'You have no money,'"" said Holt, describing the incident last year. A milk carton was taken away, and the girl's food was dumped in the trash. ""She did not protest, other than to walk away in tears.""

Holt has joined a chorus of outrage against lunchroom practices that can humiliate children as public school districts across the United States rethink how they cope with unpaid student lunch debts.

The U.S. Agriculture Department is requiring districts to adopt policies this month for addressing meal debts and to inform parents at the start of the academic year.

The agency is not specifically barring most of the embarrassing tactics, such as serving cheap sandwiches in place of hot meals or sending students home with conspicuous debt reminders, such as hand stamps. But it is encouraging schools to work more closely with parents to address delinquent accounts and ensure children don't go hungry.

""Rather than a hand stamp on a kid to say, 'I need lunch money,' send an email or a text message to the parent,"" said Tina Namian, who oversees the federal agency's school meals policy branch.

Meanwhile, some states are taking matters into their own hands, with New Mexico this year becoming the first to outlaw school meal shaming and several others weighing similar laws.

Free and reduced-price meals funded by the Agriculture Department's National School Lunch Program shield the nation's poorest children from so-called lunch shaming. Kids can eat for free if a family of four earns less than about $32,000 a year or at a discount if earnings are under $45,000.

It's households with slightly higher incomes that are more likely to struggle, experts on poverty and nutrition say.

Children often bear the brunt of unpaid meal accounts. A 2014 federal report found 39 percent of districts nationwide hand out cheap alternative meals with no nutritional requirements and up to 6 percent refuse to serve students with no money.

The debate over debts and child nutrition has spilled into state legislatures and reached Capitol Hill, as child advocacy groups question whether schools should be allowed to single out, in any way, a child whose family has not paid for meals.

""There's no limit to the bad behavior a school can have. They just have to put it in writing,"" said Jennifer Ramo, executive director of New Mexico Appleseed, an advocacy group on poverty issues. ""We live in a credit society. I think schools should handle debt like everybody else does: You don't take away food from children. You feed them and you settle the bill later.""

Related: Trump Administration Eyes Looser School Lunch Regs

Spurred by Appleseed and others, New Mexico in April passed its anti-meal-shaming law, which directs schools to work directly with parents to address payments and requires that children get a healthy, balanced meal regardless of whether debts are paid on time.

Elsewhere, the California Senate in May unanimously approved a bill that prevents schools from denying lunch if a parent or guardian has not paid.

Thresa Thomas, a Los Angeles Unified School District food service worker for students with severe physical and learning disabilities, grinds up complimentary cheese sandwiches in a food processor to serve through feeding tubes to students who don't bring lunch and whose parents have not paid.

“ There's no limit to the bad behavior a school can have. They just have to put it in writing.”

""They're not able to complain too much,"" she said. ""We should give them all the same food, and we should collect the money as much as possible.""

Texas recently adopted a temporary grace period for students to keep eating cafeteria food while debt payments are negotiated with parents.

At the federal level, language has been proposed for next year's House appropriations bill that would set minimum standards to protect children from public embarrassment and leave them out of payment discussions.

Related: Dad Raises $40,000 to Pay School Lunch Debt

New Mexico's Hunger-Free Students' Bill of Rights Act was ushered through the Statehouse by Democratic Sen. Michael Padilla, who was raised in foster homes and vividly recalls having to sweep and mop the lunchroom to earn meals at an Albuquerque public school.

""It's shouldn't be that way,"" Padilla said. ""This should not have to be a thought for a child.""

Federal cash subsidies feed two out of three students statewide - yet meals still go unpaid, school administrators say.

""The piece that is really different in this legislation is that you cannot turn a child away no matter what they owe,"" said Nancy Cathey, who oversees food services at Las Cruces Public Schools.

That provision is likely to drive up the district's unpaid meal accounts, which recently totaled $8,000, she said. The district previously declined to serve high school students who cannot pay and extended a $25 credit to middle-schoolers.

Most districts aim to keep meal costs close to $3.20, the typical federal reimbursement rate for free lunches.

The Albuquerque district is still weighing whether it can afford to serve the same hot meal to all students and do away with an alternative cold meal that has been nicknamed derisively the ""cheese sandwich of shame.""

Sian McCullough of Albuquerque said her stepdaughter was confronted in first grade with an alternative brown-bag lunch when their meal account went unpaid.

""The intent was, 'We do this because the kids will go home embarrassed and send the money,'"" she said. ""It just didn't sit well with me."

The Chinese group Speak Out was due to hold a conference in the city of Chengdu, in Sichuan province, on July 23. But the venue canceled the booking, citing conflicting events, the group said.

It is not illegal to be gay in China but LGBTQ activists say deeply conservative attitudes toward homosexuality in some sections of society have led to occasional government clamp-downs.

In May, the lesbian dating app Rela was shut down, though it was not yet clear why.

Many people were surprised by the cancelation. Many young Chinese people regard Chengdu as ""gaydu"", or ""the city of the gays"", due to its liberal LGBTQ views.

""The conference venue Jinsha theater told us that a government official activity was scheduled to be held on the same day, which left us with no choice but to cancel,"" the founder of Speak Out, who gave his name only as Matthew, told Reuters.

An office administrator at the theater told Reuters she was not aware of the situation.

Speak Out ran into similar problems when it tried to organize a gay rights conference in the city of Xian in late May.

""The local state security bureau in Chengdu has also been in touch with us by phone in recent days, asking questions such as what is our next move on the arrangement for any event and what we are going to talk about at the event,"" Matthew said.

The Chengdu government information office could not be reached by telephone for comment.

The cancelation prompted hundreds of postings on the Weibo social media platform, with many people expressing sympathy.

""Cheer up, the dawn comes after hard struggles in the dark. We shall see each other someday,"" wrote one Weibo user.

Some gay people are forced by their parents or wives to be treated in hospitals where they are diagnosed as having ""sexual preference disorder."" Many are forced to take drugs or even undergo electro-shock treatments.

In 2014, Peng sued a conversion therapy clinic over the suffering he went through and won. Authorities made the clinic remove advertisements for its service from the internet.

""I felt very sorry for the cancelation,"" Peng told Reuters.

John McCain, R-Ariz., lived up to his nickname of ""maverick"" by voting down his party's health care bill early Friday morning, he wouldn't have drawn nearly as much fanfare or ire without the help of two Republican women senators.

McCain might have delivered the night’s dramatics with an unexpected thumbs down on the Senate floor, but it was the votes of Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska that brought their party's so-called ""skinny"" health care bill to its knees in a 51-49 vote.

And the two centrist senators have been steadfast in their opposition to the GOP’s attempts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, earning wrath from President Donald Trump on Twitter, as well as from congressional colleagues.

On Wednesday, Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., told MSNBC that ""somebody needs to go over there to that Senate and snatch a knot in their ass."" His office later said the comment was not directed at anyone in particular.

Referring to the opposition to the bill on Monday, Texas Congressman Blake Farenthold said on a radio show, ""there are some female senators from the Northeast — if it was a guy from South Texas, I might ask him to step outside and settle this Aaron Burr-style.""

Collins accidentally responded to Farenthold's threat when she was overheard on a live microphone deriding the congressman's appearance — a reference to a widely-circulated image of him wearing ""ducky"" pajamas while posing next to a woman in lingerie.

Farenthold and Collins both later apologized for their respective comments.

But the GOP have long been unhappy with the two senators for creating obstacles in the party's long-stated goal of dismantling the Affordable Care Act.

Murkowski and Collins were previously the only two GOP senators to vote against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s procedural vote on Tuesday afternoon, and were also two of the nine GOP senators who voted down the Better Care Reconciliation Act later that night.

While both have had lengthy Senate careers, they aren't as recognizable as McCain, a two-time presidential candidate and Vietnam war hero.

So who are Murkowski and Collins? And why did they, as Republicans, vote against this Republican health care bill?

Lisa Murkowski, senior senator from Alaska

One of Alaska’s two senators has been named Murkowski since 1981. Before Lisa Murkowski entered the Senate in 2002, her father, Frank Murkowski, held the seat for three terms.

He left the Senate in 2002 after winning the state's governorship and appointed his daughter to replace him, which was met with some criticism at the time — though she had served in the Alaska House of Representatives and was appointed Majority Leader of the statehouse.

Murkowski went on to win reelection with a plurality in 2004, 2010 and 2016. In 2010, she notably won via a write-in campaign — the first time a Senate seat was won via write-in since 1954.

Since she entered the Senate, Murkowski has made some splashes — but few waves — with her more moderate positions. Nevertheless, Murkowski is not the typical conservative Republican in the Senate, as she often defies party for her state.

The American Conservative Union gives her a lifetime conservative rating of 59.63 percent.

Outside of health care votes, she most recently earned some attention as one of two senators who voted against the confirmation of Education Secretary Betsy Devos.

Wavering from the party line on health care has earned her more than a little abuse from the Trump administration. Trump took to Twitter to announce his displeasure after an early health care vote on Wednesday.

Senator @lisamurkowski of the Great State of Alaska really let the Republicans, and our country, down yesterday. Too bad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017

And, according to the Alaska Dispatch News, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke called both of Alaska's senators to let them know that the administration may attempt to economically punish their state because of Murkowski's vote. That led Democratic lawmakers to become unlikely bedfellows with the Republican senator by demanding that the U.S. Government Accountability Office and the Interior Department's inspector general investigate Zinke's calls.

Despite the controversy, the Alaska senator said on Friday that she voted based on what she thought was best for her constituents, who — she claimed — had helped guide her vote.

“I hear from fishermen who can’t afford the coverage that they have, small business owners who can’t afford insurance at all, and those who have gained coverage for the first time in their life,” she said in a statement on her vote. “These Alaskans have shared their anxiety that their personal situation may be made worse under the legislation considered this week.”

The various bills that the GOP has produced, she said, lacked substance.

Murkowski also doesn't have much to worry about, as compared to some of her Senate colleagues. She won reelection in 2016 and won't face another challenger until 2022.

Susan Collins, senior senator from Maine

A born-and-bred resident of Maine, Collins won the Maine Republican primary for governor in 1994 — the first woman to earn a major party nomination for the state’s governorship — but she would go on to lose to her now Senate colleague Angus King.

In 1996, she returned to the campaign trail to run for the seat Republican Sen. William Cohen vacated to serve as Secretary of Defense under President Bill Clinton. Collins had worked for Cohen in the Senate for 12 years and, with his endorsement, won the seat by five points. She won again in 2002, 2008 and 2014 with increasing margins.

Largely considered a moderate — the American Conservative Union gave her a 44.85 percent conservative lifetime rating — Collins isn’t always a dependable vote for her GOP colleagues.

She also has thumbed her nose at Trump more than once, most recently during the live microphone incident, which also caught her disparaging Trump's handling of the budget — she called it ""incredibly irresponsible.""

Related: What’s Going to Happen to Obamacare?

Health care is only the latest time she’s turned against the Republican tide, but she claims it's for good reason.

Collins applauded the ACA for providing health insurance to millions of Americans for the first time, but she quickly noted that many have also faced “skyrocketing premiums and unaffordable deductibles coupled with mandates that give them few, if any, choices.”

The problems didn’t stop there, but Collins said she was more concerned with finding solutions.

“These problems require a bipartisan solution,” Collins said in a statement on Friday. “The Democrats made a big mistake when they passed the ACA without a single Republican vote. I don’t want to see Republicans make the same mistake."" McCain cited similar reasoning in his opposition.

Collins explained each of her votes against Republican plans, consistently citing the CBO scores that said the legislation would result in tens of millions of Americans losing their health care coverage.

But that wasn’t her only reason. She noted that the GOP wanted to pull funding from Planned Parenthood, an act she called “misguided” because the organization provides women with “family planning, cancer screening, and basic preventive health care services"" and relieved the load of small clinics and community health centers.

Collins also noted that none of the federal funding that goes to Planned Parenthood pays for abortion except for cases of rape, incest or when the mother’s life is at risk. She claimed the bill would only interfere in a woman's ability to choose her health care provider.

Collins said that solutions can still be found, particularly if Republicans and Democrats work together in the Senate. A group of senators, which includes Murkowski and Collins, are already working toward that end.

“Neither party has a monopoly on good ideas,” Collins concluded, “and we must work together to put together a bipartisan bill that fixes the flaws in the ACA and works for all Americans.”"

That’s the question that the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston will try to answer today — the first time a federal appeals court will consider the issue.

At issue is a 2014 New Hampshire law that makes it a crime, punishable by a fine of up to $1,000, for voters to take pictures of their ballots and share them on social media. Enforcement of the law was blocked a year ago by a federal judge, and the state appealed.



Only nine states appear to either explicitly allow ballot selfies or have no currently enforceable state law clearly forbidding it.

Most of the states, 26, explicitly ban it through various laws, including prohibitions on bringing cameras into polling places.

The law is unclear in Arkansas, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, Ohio, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.

Close video Trump sloppy tweet attack on transgender US troops sparks outrage Sue Fulton, U.S. Army veteran and founding member of OutServe, and Allison Jaslow, executive director of IAVA, talk with Rachel Maddow about Donald Trump’s surprise attack on transgender U.S. service members and how his new policy might be implemented. share tweet email save Embed

That, of course, was before the policy was denounced by members of Congress from both parties. And before the Pentagon and the Department of Veterans Affairs said they hadn’t been notified of the change. And before veterans’ organizations denounced the pointless discrimination against active-duty soldiers.

But perhaps the most amazing moment in the rollout of Trump’s ridiculous new rules came during Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ press briefing yesterday, when the president’s principal spokesperson struggled to explain what the policy was and how it would work – because she simply did not know.

A reporter asked whether transgender Americans already in uniform would be kicked out of the military. Sanders didn’t know. Another asked, “How does it maintain or improve unit cohesion to leave thousands of servicemembers, some who may be overseas, serving in units overseas, in the dark about their status within the military?” Sanders couldn’t answer that, either.

As the questions continued, the White House press secretary threatened to simply walk away from the podium unless reporters changed the subject.

“Guys, I really don’t have anything else to add on that topic. As I do, I’ll keep you posted. But if those are the only questions we have, I’m going to call it a day.”

Ordinarily, when a White House unveils a new policy, affecting thousands of Americans, there are more than just a few tweets on the subject. There’s supposed to be a briefing on the details of the policy, along with some background materials, and often an opportunity to hear from relevant officials within the executive branch.

But in Trump World, everything is … different.

The president fired off a few online missives, and the White House, apparently in the dark about its own new policy, couldn’t answer substantive questions about the policy. Indeed, in this case, Sanders couldn’t even refer reporters to the Pentagon for additional information about the implementation of the policy because Team Trump didn’t bother to brief Defense Department officials, either.

Trump’s new ban sits at the intersection of discrimination and incompetence.

Towards the end of the unsatisfying briefing, the White House press secretary told reporters, “I think the president has made very clear he’s committed to fighting for all Americans.” That’s a plainly foolish thing to say just hours after the president announced a new plan to discriminate against transgender Americans, but it’s also rather ironic: those men and women in uniform, who are now facing the threat of being discharged, are actually committed to fighting for all Americans.

Trump, regrettably, seems principally focused on fighting for himself."

The last person to speak to Donald Trump often convinces him, just so long as no one else gets his ear.But Vickie Glenn won’t get that chance, at least not before House Republicans pass their depraved legislation this afternoon.You might be wondering why we’re just hearing about something like this now. Indeed, the Times’ report coincides with a Wall Street Journal piece , which we discussed earlier, about the realization that the GOP bill may also undermine private-employer-based insurance in ways that haven’t been talked about, either.The explanation for this has everything to do with how House Republicans are choosing to legislate. Ordinarily, concerns such as these would be raised over the course of months, as policymakers hold hearings, receive testimony from subject-matter experts, consult with industry stakeholders, and scrutinize the projected impact of their proposals. They even have the opportunity – get this – to improve bills before voting on them as they learn of unintended consequences.But not in this case. Republicans are rushing the bill onto the floor without hearings, without testimony, without debate, without scrutiny, and without so much as a CBO score.And so we’re seeing stories like these about hurting special-needs kids the day of the vote. We’re likely to learn even more tomorrow and in the coming days – after the bill passes the House."

That’s the question that the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston will try to answer today — the first time a federal appeals court will consider the issue.

At issue is a 2014 New Hampshire law that makes it a crime, punishable by a fine of up to $1,000, for voters to take pictures of their ballots and share them on social media. Enforcement of the law was blocked a year ago by a federal judge, and the state appealed.



Only nine states appear to either explicitly allow ballot selfies or have no currently enforceable state law clearly forbidding it.

Most of the states, 26, explicitly ban it through various laws, including prohibitions on bringing cameras into polling places.

The law is unclear in Arkansas, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, Ohio, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.

http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-takes-aim-support-historically-black-colleges,msnbc,Trump takes aim at support for historically black colleges,[],"In late February, Donald Trump signed an executive order intended to signal support for historically black colleges and universities. The Republican president, who hosted a widely seen photo-op in the Oval Office with HBCU officials, said at the time that these institutions of higher learning would be “an absolute priority for this White House.”Trump added at the time, “I am thrilled to be signing an executive order to recognize the importance of historically black colleges and universities – very important. They have played such an important role in achieving progress for African Americans in our nation’s march for justice.”As it turns out, the White House is saying something quite different now. Politico reported over the weekend:

A Washington Post report added, “People in higher education circles worried that the statement meant that the president was planning to get rid of a capital financing program that helps historically black colleges repair, renovate and build new facilities.”The Post’s report added that Trump intends to treat the financing program “in a manner consistent with the (constitutional) requirement to afford equal protection of the laws.”In fairness, no one knows exactly what that’s intended to mean.Indeed, there’s some ambiguities surrounding the administration’s position. Trump, who obviously doesn’t keep up on policy details or the substance of any area, pointed to the Historically Black College and University Capital Financing Program – a program that helps these school receive low-cost construction loans – as potentially problematic, but no one can say what that means in practical terms, or what the White House intends to do next.Derek W. Black, a law professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law who studies constitutional and education law, told Politico the signing statement is “ rather odd .” The professor added, “If Congress is validly spending money on these programs, and there’s no court finding or litigation suggesting discrimination, the idea that the executive would unilaterally not allocate those funds would be a rather momentous position to take.”It’d also be the exact opposite of what Trump told officials from these schools as recently as late February.As a candidate, the Republican billionaire routinely told largely white audiences, “Look at how much African-American communities are suffering from Democratic control. To those I say the following: what do you have to lose by trying something new like Trump? What do you have to lose?”As it turns out, they have quite a bit to lose."

The rising profiles of staffers have been enough to doom their relationships with the man in the Oval Office before. But for now, the war that new White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci is waging against ""leaks"" in the White House is a fight Trump wants to have.

""Remember what he’s prosecuting here,"" a source close to the White House told NBC News about Scaramucci. ""Leaks. The one thing [Trump] hates more than anything.""

And the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., seemed supportive of Scaramucci's quest to clamp down on leaks, saying Friday: ""All I know is that he isn't/wasn't the leak!!!""

Shocked the media is going after @Scaramucci for working to cut off their ""sources"" & leaks. All I know is that he isn't/wasn't the leak!!! — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 28, 2017

Trump has been outspoken about his desire to rid himself of the leaking that has plagued his administration.

A Justice Department spokeswoman released a statement Thursday night — after Scaramucci tweeted about leaks — saying that ""we have seen an astonishing increase in the number of leaks of classified national security information in recent months.""

""We agree with Anthony [Scaramucci] that these staggering number of leaks are undermining the ability of our government to function and to protect this country,"" the statement from DOJ's Sarah Isgur Flores read.

Scaramucci has been in his role less than a week and has been a top headline for almost all of them. He's appeared for fiery interviews on cable news, defending the president and shooting back at his detractors. He's been clear about his love for and loyalty to the president.

Scaramucci has also stoked palace intrigue and further inflamed already-ongoing internal battles.

In scathing comments, Scaramucci called now-departed Chief of StaffReince Priebus ""a f------ paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac,"" in a phone conversation with the New Yorker’s Ryan Lizza, predicting that the embattled chief of staff would soon resign.

The two men have long harbored bad blood, with Priebus trying to block Scaramucci for West Wing jobs both at the start of the administration and as recently as last week when Trump picked the man known as ""Mooch"" to head up a lagging White House communications team, according to sources inside and outside of the White House familiar with the situation.

On Friday afternoon, Scaramucci could be seen boarding Air Force One with his ""brother"" in arms, Priebus, en route to a speech with the president in New York.

However, by early Friday evening, Priebus was out and Trump tapped Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly for the job. And Scaramucci's White House arrival also helped usher in the departure of embattled Press Secretary Sean Spicer, a longtime Priebus ally.

Scaramucci’s rant also included shots at top White House adviser Steve Bannon, whom Scaramucci accused of trying to raise his status through his proximity to Trump.

""I’m not trying to build my own brand off the f------ strength of the President. I’m here to serve the country,"" Scaramucci told the New Yorker.

His expletive-laden tirade about his White House co-workers grated some in Trump’s orbit, the same source said, calling the comments ""embarrassing.""

That Scaramucci says he's not in the White House to brand-build could be his saving grace. In a world that's all about Trump, insiders are quick to note aides who saw their public personas elevated were seen to have then drawn Trump’s ire for stealing the spotlight.

And it's possible that the communications director has had enough of the spotlight's glare for now — on Friday, organizers confirmed that Scaramucci's scheduled appearance this weekend at Politicon, a political gathering in Pasadena, California, was scrapped."

http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-campaigns-pittsburgh-not-paris-rally-draws-dozens,msnbc,"Trump campaign’s ‘Pittsburgh, not Paris’ rally draws ‘dozens’",[],"In his White House speech on Thursday afternoon, Donald Trump delivered a soundbite that conservatives quickly embraced: “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.” The phrase, which drew quick applause from the president’s supporters, did not, however, make any sense: the international climate accord was agreed to in Paris, but it was intended to benefit everyone, not just Parisians.

Nevertheless, this Politico report, published the day after Trump’s speech, didn’t come as too big a surprise to anyone.

President Donald Trump’s campaign announced a “Pittsburgh, not Paris” rally across from the White House on Saturday to celebrate the United States’ withdrawal from a global climate agreement. The Fairfax County Republican Committee and the Republican Party of Virginia are sponsoring the rally in Lafayette Square, which is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. Saturday, according to an announcement from the Trump campaign.

It was hard not to appreciate the irony of Republicans holding a “Pittsburgh, not Paris” rally in Lafayette Square – literally across the street from the north side of the White House – which is named after a French general, Marquis de Lafayette, who helped America win the Revolutionary War. New York magazine’s Jon Chait noted, “There is literally no stupider location in the entire world to stage an anti-French American rally.”

And while that may be true, that doesn’t necessarily mean turnout for such a gathering would be poor. After all, if a sitting president’s campaign team announces support for a rally in a major American city, and the event is officially sponsored by a nearby state Republican Party, it stands to reason that plenty of GOP diehards would come out to express their support for Trump’s anti-climate decision.

So, how many people showed up?

BuzzFeed, which published some pictures from the rally, wrote that “dozens of Trump supporters” gathered for the event. The Washington Post similarly reported that “dozens” showed up to applaud the president’s decision to withdraw from the international agreement.

Hmm. The population of Washington, D.C, is nearly 700,000, but the greater D.C. area has over 6 million residents. Fairfax County, Va., near the nation’s capital, itself has over 1 million people. Trump World and its Republican allies managed to get “dozens” of people to express support for the president’s big decision?

That’s pretty sad – though I’ll look forward to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer telling reporters today that this was the largest turnout for any event in the history of Lafayette Square … ever.

Postscript: The Washington Post’s report added, “More than a thousand people gathered near the Washington Monument Saturday to rally at the March for Truth, calling for an independent investigation into alleged collusion between Russia and President Trump’s 2016 campaign.”

So on the one hand, we saw an event endorsed by the sitting president’s campaign operation, which drew “dozens” of people, while on the other hand, we saw a separate event – in the same city, on the same day, at nearly the same time – that wasn’t sponsored by any campaign, which drew “more than a thousand” attendees.

I’m starting to get the impression that one side of the political divide has a definite advantage when it comes to grassroots activism and enthusiasm.

Postscript: Reader B.G. reminds me of an “Arrested Development” episode that seems especially relevant to this story."

As we discussed the other day, Trump’s speech included bitter criticism of journalists, pollsters, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and the Affordable Care Act. He used his platform to, among other things, celebrate the 2016 electoral-college map, and threaten to fire his HHS secretary if the Republican health care plan didn’t pass Congress.

At one point, Trump even told a long, meandering story about a cocktail party he attended on a yacht with a bunch of “hot” people.

Today, the Boy Scouts organization expressed public regret for the way the president conducted himself at this week’s event.

The head of the Boy Scouts apologized Thursday for President Donald Trump’s remarks this week at a gathering of thousands of scouts, saying “political rhetoric” should never have been inserted into the event. In a letter posted online, Chief Scout Executive for the Boy Scouts of America Michael Surbaugh apologized to those “offended by the political rhetoric that was inserted into the jamboree. That was never our intent.”

Surbaugh, in a statement that emphasized the organization’s non-partisan traditions, added, “We sincerely regret that politics were inserted into the Scouting program.”

This is where American politics has arrived in 2017: tens of thousands of children gathered for an event, and it was the president’s misbehavior that warranted a public apology."

http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/strike-three-republicans-health-care-crusade-collapses-senate,msnbc,Strike Three: Republicans’ health care crusade collapses in Senate,[],"Health care advocates have reason to be relieved this morning.

Senate Republicans failed to pass a pared-down Obamacare repeal bill early Friday on a vote of 49-51 that saw three of their own dramatically break ranks. Three Republican senators – John McCain, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski – and all Democrats voted against the bill, dealing a stinging defeat to President Donald Trump who made repeal of Obamacare a cornerstone of his presidential campaign.

It was McCain who ultimately cast the deciding vote in a moment of high drama on the Senate floor in the early hours of the morning.

And with that, let’s have another Q&A.

What now?

Well, Senate Republicans have now run out of bills. “Repeal and replace” was voted down on Tuesday; “repeal and delay” was voted down on Wednesday; and then “skinny repeal” came up one vote short last night. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) declared last night, “It’s time to move on.”

Right, but what does that mean in practical terms?

No one, including Senate Republicans, can answer that with any confidence. At least in theory, senators can now begin work on some bipartisan measures intended to strengthen the current system and shore up areas in which the Affordable Care Act is struggling.

How likely is that?

It’s very likely there will be at least some efforts in this direction, and a couple of Senate committees have even agreed to hold hearings (something they should have done before holding votes on legislation). There are plenty of straightforward policies that both parties should be able to accept, but whether that will happen or not is anybody’s guess.

But haven’t we been at this point before? In March, a House Republican plan died, we all exhaled, and then it came back to life. What’s to stop that from happening again?

Frankly, nothing. The makeup of the Senate will continue to pose challenges for opponents of health care, but the GOP’s repeal crusade will not end anytime soon. Health care advocates will need to be vigilant.

Was John McCain’s vote a surprise?

That’s a matter of perspective. When he returned to the Senate this week, McCain delivered a dramatic speech in which he suggested he’d oppose exactly this kind of effort. It was unclear, however, whether the Arizonan would stick to those principles. Last night, he did.

How’s Donald Trump taking all of this?

As of this moment, the president has not yet had a full-blown Twitter tantrum – perhaps he’s sleeping in? – but he did write after the vote, “3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!”

What does that mean?

Your guess is as good as mine. “Obamacare” is not going to “implode” on its own, but the fear is Trump, who’s already taken steps to sabotage the current health care system, may intensify those efforts now.

But wouldn’t that make the president directly responsible for hurting people?

Yes, though Trump may very well do it anyway.

Anything else?

The reverberations from last night will linger for a while, and they should. Senate Republicans put on a ridiculous display – and abused the legislative process in ways with no modern precedent – all in the hopes of taking health care benefits away from millions of Americans. They came up with regressive and unpopular ideas, rejected by doctors, nurses, hospitals, insurers, and health care advocates, and they very nearly passed a bill anyway.

It may be a while until Capitol Hill feels “normal” again."

The study, released Thursday by the Education Department’s research division, follows several other recent studies of state-funded vouchers in Louisiana, Indiana and Ohio that suggested negative effects on student achievement.

It leaves the Trump administration in an awkward position. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who was nominated and confirmed despite her opposition to public education and ignorance about education policy, is one of the nation’s leading advocates of privatizing schools through voucher schemes. It’s a crusade she continues to pursue with great vigor.The more the evidence mounts against the idea, the more Team Trump is left to argue that they want a policy that plainly doesn’t work.And before conservatives argue that this D.C. study is only one report, consider that there’s ample evidence pointing in the same direction. The New York Times reported in February, “[E]ven as school choice is poised to go national, a wave of new research has emerged suggesting that private school vouchers may harm students who receive them. The results are startling – the worst in the history of the field, researchers say…. It’s rare to see efforts to improve test scores having the opposite result.”For federal policymakers, the question is simple: does real-world evidence matter more than ideological goals or not?Postscript: Just as an aside, note that the Obama administration considered scrapping the D.C. voucher system, but then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) made a direct appeal to the Democratic president, saying it was personally important to him that the voucher program continue. Obama, trying to be conciliatory, agreed to leave it alone."

Yesterday, DeVos was on Capitol Hill, testifying at a House Appropriations subcommittee, where the education secretary was eager to defend Donald Trump’s budget request for directing taxpayer money to private and parochial schools. Most of the hearing went about as one might expect, but an exchange between DeVos and Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) was of particular interest, because it focused on the voucher movement’s Achilles’ heel: taxpayer-subsidized discrimination.



Slate had Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is having an interesting week. On Monday, for example, the Republican opponent of public education argued that “defenders of current system” of education are “ flat-earthers .” I don’t think she was kidding.Yesterday, DeVos was on Capitol Hill, testifying at a House Appropriations subcommittee, where the education secretary was eager to defend Donald Trump’s budget request for directing taxpayer money to private and parochial schools. Most of the hearing went about as one might expect, but an exchange between DeVos and Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) was of particular interest, because it focused on the voucher movement’s Achilles’ heel: taxpayer-subsidized discrimination.Slate had a good piece on what transpired:

Clark used Bloomington, Indiana’s Lighthouse Christian Academy as an example. The school currently gets more than $665,000 in state funding through a school voucher program, Clark said. It also openly reserves the right to deny admittance to any student in a family where there is “homosexual or bisexual activity” or family members who practice “alternate gender identity.” If Indiana applies for federal funding for schools like these, Clark asked DeVos, would her Department of Education require them to stop discriminating against LGBTQ students and families?



DeVos didn’t say yes or no. She just smiled and stuck to the generations-old cover for violent oppression in America. “The states set up the rules,” she said. “I believe states continue to have flexibility in putting together programs.”"

But this Politico piece suggests McConnell’s not playing the blame game especially well.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell expressed “regret” and “disappointment” immediately after the GOP failed to pass a minimalist Obamacare repeal bill early Friday, blaming congressional Democrats for not engaging “in a serious way” in the efforts to remedy the health care law. […] “Our friends on the other side decided early on they didn’t want to engage with us in a serious way, a serious way to help those suffering under Obamacare,” McConnell said.

There are a few ways to look at whining like this. The first is to simply recognize it as pathetic. McConnell couldn’t convince his own members to follow his lead, and for him to blame the minority party for refusing to help him undermine Americans’ interests is impossible to take seriously.

The second is that McConnell is plainly wrong about what Democrats were willing to do. As we discussed weeks ago, Democrats practically begged Republicans to work cooperatively on health care. They put their appeals in writing for months, but GOP leaders ignored every appeal.

McConnell considered a bipartisanship approach, in a rather literal sense, the worst-case scenario. In March, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) characterized bipartisanship as the one course of action he simply did not want to even consider.

But even putting these details aside, let’s not overlook the fact that McConnell is perhaps the last person in the country who should be talking about engaging in health care policymaking “in a serious way.”

The Senate Majority Leader wrote a ridiculous eight-page health care bill yesterday afternoon. His office released it to the public last night. Senators began voting on it about three hours later. Many GOP senators opposed their party’s final bill, but agreed to vote for it anyway after receiving assurances that the bill they were advancing probably wouldn’t become law.

The Washington Post’s Greg Sargent noted this morning that as the fight over health care continued to unfold, Republicans treated the political and legislative process “like toilet paper.”

The GOP campaign for a health-care overhaul, Greg explained, “has been absolutely saturated from top to bottom with bad faith and scandalously brazen abuses of our governing norms for months. We’ve seen endless lies about the Affordable Care Act and the possible GOP replacement; an unprecedentedly secretive and rushed process in the GOP-led Congress; attacks on the legitimacy of nonpartisan budget scorekeepers; and the apparent use of taxpayer funds to promote the Republican replacement and undermine the ACA.”

Sure, Mitch, tell us again about how important it is to you that policymakers work on health care “in a serious way.”"

http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-intellectual-debate-rick-perry-says-he-wants-already-over,msnbc,The ‘intellectual’ debate Rick Perry says he wants is already over,[],"Last week, Energy Secretary Rick Perry told CNBC he considers his skepticism towards climate data to be a sign of a “wise, intellectually engaged person.” Yesterday, at a press briefing at the White House – it’s apparently supposed to be “Energy Week” – Perry used similar phrasing, calling for “an intellectual conversation” on global warming.

“Can we agree we ought to have a conversation as a people?” the Republican cabinet secretary asked. “Intellectually engaged, not screaming at each other, and not standing up in the middle of my speeches and saying you’re a climate denier, when the fact is, I just want to have a conversation about this.”

At face value, this may sound perfectly defensible. All Perry says he wants is a free exchange of ideas, with people of good faith sharing evidence as part of an open, deliberative process. Who’s prepared to take a stand against reasoned discourse and polite discussions? If Perry wants a conversation, why not engage in one?

The answer, as The New Republic’s Emily Atkin explained very well, is that Perry’s posture is a sham.

Make no mistake: When Perry says he just wants an “intellectual conversation” about how much carbon dioxide impacts the climate, that is a lie. Or, in the most generous interpretation, it’s a misunderstanding of what an “intellectual conversation” really is. Any intellectual person accepts that the scientific method is among society’s most reliable tools for determining facts. And climatologists have overwhelmingly determined, by use of the scientific method, that carbon dioxide emissions are the primary cause of current climate change. Perry is unwilling to accept the scientific method. Therefore, an intellectual conversation is not what he wants. What Perry does seem to want is further delay any actual intellectual conversation about climate change: a conversation that focuses on how best to solve it.

Quite right. Wise, intellectually engaged people have already wrapped up the conversation Rick Perry says he’s eager to have. They’ve now moved on to different conversations about solutions, stop-gaps, consequences, and points of no return.

If Rick Perry wants to get up to speed and participate in those discussions, I’m sure he could find some scientists who’d donate their time and help him understand the issues about which he’s still confused.

But let’s not mistake cynicism with curiosity. Perry keeps using that word, “intellectual,” but I don’t think it means that he thinks it means."
http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/perry-sees-climate-denial-evidence-being-intellectually-engaged,msnbc,Perry sees climate denial as evidence of being ‘intellectually engaged’,[],"In the Obama administration, the first Energy Secretary was Steven Chu, a Nobel laureate and a physics professor at Berkeley. He was succeeded by Ernest Moniz, who led the physics department at MIT.

In the Trump administration, things are a little … different.

Energy Secretary Rick Perry told CNBC on Monday he does not believe carbon dioxide emissions from human activity are the main driver of climate change, joining the EPA administrator in casting doubt on the conclusion of some of the government’s top scientists. Asked whether CO2 emissions are primarily responsible for climate change, Perry told CNBC’s “Squawk Box”: “No, most likely the primary control knob is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in.”

In an apparent attempt to drive the reality-based community batty, Perry added that his skepticism towards climate data is a sign of a “wise, intellectually engaged person.”

It’s not just the cabinet secretary’s rejection of climate science that rankles; it’s also Perry’s explanation. He not only fails to accept the effects of carbon pollution, Perry believes climate change is the result of oceans “and this environment.”

What does that mean? I have no idea, but just as importantly, there’s no reason to believe Perry has any idea, either.

This reminded me of a New York Times piece from a couple of weeks ago, which I’ve been meaning to mention:

The campaign ad appeared during the presidential contest of 2008. Rapid-fire images of belching smokestacks and melting ice sheets were followed by a soothing narrator who praised a candidate who had stood up to President George W. Bush and “sounded the alarm on global warming.” It was not made for a Democrat, but for Senator John McCain, who had just secured the Republican nomination. It is difficult to reconcile the Republican Party of 2008 with the party of 2017, whose leader, President Trump, has called global warming a hoax, reversed environmental policies that Mr. McCain advocated on his run for the White House, and this past week announced that he would take the nation out of the Paris climate accord, which was to bind the globe in an effort to halt the planet’s warming.

In the Obama era, denying climate science became part of what it means to be a Republican. The more evidence emerged, pointing to a global crisis, the more GOP officials, candidates, and pundits announced their preference for dangerous, willful ignorance.

Several years ago, Mother Jones’ Kevin Drum wrote a memorable item about the trajectory of climate denial:

1. The world isn’t warming. 2. OK, it’s warming, but it’s not man-made. It’s just natural climate variability. 3. Fine, people are responsible. But it’s not economically worth it to do anything about it.

As Perry’s on-air comments to CNBC reminded us, contemporary Republicans have regressed, finding themselves split between numbers 1 and 2.

History’s judgment will be brutal."

He was overpowered and arrested.

The assailant entered the supermarket in the Barmbek district on Friday afternoon and stabbed one man, who died at the scene. Police said the victim is believed to be a 50-year-old German.

After the assailant fled and wounded five others with the knife -- a woman and four men -- he was overwhelmed by passers-by and slightly injured in the process, police said. Officers then arrested him. A sixth man was injured while overpowering the attacker.

The wounded people, some of whom were seriously hurt, were taken to hospitals, authorities said.

Morris Mac Matzen / Reuters

The suspect is a 26-year-old who was born in the United Arab Emirates, police said Friday evening. They said they are still working to establish his nationality.

There was no immediate word on his possible motive and police said that they are ""still investigating in every direction."" They said there was no indication that there was more than one attacker.

News agency dpa quoted two witnesses at a nearby bakery as saying they heard the assailant shout ""Allahu akbar!"" as he held up the knife, but police did not confirm the report.

""Allahu akbar"" means ""God is great"" in Arabic and has been used by Islamic extremists when carrying out violent acts.

Barmbek is in northeastern Hamburg, away from the downtown district."
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tweets-about-senate-after-failure-of-health-care-vote/,cbsnews,Trump tweets about Senate after failure of health care vote,[],"After the plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act failed in the Senate, President Trump began tweeting about changing the rules in the Senate.

""If Republicans are going to pass great future legislation in the Senate, they must immediately go to a 51 vote majority, not senseless 60...,"" he tweeted.

If Republicans are going to pass great future legislation in the Senate, they must immediately go to a 51 vote majority, not senseless 60... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2017

In most cases, legislation requires 60 votes in the Senate for passage, although this was not the case in the vote on the so-called ""skinny repeal"" early Friday morning. That amendment was, in fact, one that required only a simple majority of 51 senators to pass. GOP Senators Susan Collins, John McCain and Lisa Murkowski voted no, leaving Republicans short one vote.

Mr. Trump then tweeted again, adding, ""Even though parts of healthcare could pass at 51, some really good things need 60. So many great future bills & budgets need 60 votes.""

...Even though parts of healthcare could pass at 51, some really good things need 60. So many great future bills & budgets need 60 votes.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2017

Over the past few days, the Senate parliamentarian provided guidance that parts of the Senate plan to repeal Obamacare would require 60 votes, rather than 51, because they did not comply with what's known as the ""Byrd Rule."" This is the rule that bans the Senate from considering ""extraneous matter"" as part of a reconciliation bill. The Senate was using the budgetary tool of reconciliation to try to pass its health care bill with just 51 votes.

Amendments are considered ""extraneous"" by the parliamentarian if, for example, they don't produce a change in outlays or revenues, or if those changes are just incidental to the components of the provision that don't relate to the budget.

Immediately after the measure failed, the president tweeted that the three Republicans and 48 Democrats had ""let the American people down,"" and ""As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!""

Congress has not yet determined what its next steps on health care will be."
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/officials-escaped-prisoner-abducts-kills-assistant-wardens-teen-stepdaughter/,cbsnews,"Officials: Escaped prisoner abducts, kills assistant warden's teen stepdaughter",['Crimesider Staff'],"BATON ROUGE, La. -- A prisoner abducted and killed an assistant warden's stepdaughter after he escaped from a Louisiana prison, authorities said Friday. The inmate was later found dead after a standoff with police.

Deltra Henderson, 39, walked away from his prison assignment at David Wade Correctional Center on Thursday afternoon, stole a car and kidnapped 19-year-old Amanda Carney, the Claiborne Parish Sheriff's Office said in a statement.

Carney lived at a home on prison property with her parents, reports CBS affiliate KSLA. The station reports Henderson was on work assignment on the grounds when the escape happened.

The teenager's body was found in a wooded area near the prison where Henderson crashed the car, the sheriff's office said. Sheriff Ken Bailey said during a telephone interview that investigators believe Henderson stabbed Carney to death, but they're awaiting autopsy results.

WAFB 9 News Baton Rouge, Louisiana News, Weather, Sports

The sheriff's office says Henderson then made contact with another resident in the area and stole another vehicle before crashing it as well, KSLA reports. He then entered a nearby home on prison property and found a gun, authorities said. He barricaded himself inside after a gunfight with prison guards. Police found his body inside the home after the standoff ended.

Investigators suspect Henderson was fatally wounded while he traded gunfire with prison guards, according to the sheriff.

""Authorities worked to capture Henderson peacefully, but he fired shots at officers and they returned fire,"" read a statement released by police late Thursday to the station.

Carney was enrolling at Southern Arkansas University in the fall to study nursing, the sheriff said.

""Everybody knows everybody (here),"" the sheriff said. ""It's just tragic.""

The corrections department is offering grief counseling to staff members and inmates at the prison in Homer, which is in north Louisiana and can house up to 1,244 inmates.

Corrections Secretary James LeBlanc said it was a ""dark day"" for the state's prison system.

""Our hearts hurt today as we grieve, and mourn the loss of one of our own,"" LeBlanc said in a statement.

KSLA

Carney graduated in May from Summerfield High School, the station reports. The principal there, Shane Lee, told the station ""there's no words to express the sorrow in our hearts today.""

Lee said the community lost ""a young lady that we cherish. A lady that excelled in academics, athletics, and was a true role model to fellow classmates.""

Henderson had been an inmate at the prison since June 2001. He arrived there about a month after he began serving a 30-year prison sentence for convictions on charges of cocaine distribution, attempted armed robbery and aggravated burglary.

Henderson had a potential release date of March 28, 2025, the corrections department said.

The News-Star reported that Henderson pleaded guilty to a 1999 armed robbery at a Farmerville home where a 14-year-old girl and her mother were seriously wounded by gunfire during the robbery.

In 2015, Henderson petitioned a judge for a reduced sentence, expressing remorse and highlighting his status as a first offender, the newspaper reported.

In his petition, Henderson wrote that he had completed programs in prison ""to become a better person"" and said he had been a ""young man, running around with the wrong crowd"" at the time of his offenses."

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-hiring-job-fair-thousands-of-offers/,cbsnews,Amazon aims to hire thousands of workers in a single day,[],"Amazon (AMZN) plans to make thousands of job offers in just one day when it holds a giant job fair next week at nearly a dozen warehouses across the US.

People who are offered jobs on the spot will be hired to pack or sort boxes and help ship them to customers, with nearly 40,000 of the 50,000 jobs expected to be full-time positions, the e-commere giant said.

Most of the jobs will count toward Amazon's previously announced goal of adding 100,000 full-time workers by mid-2018. The hiring spree is yet another sign of the company's growth at a time when traditional retailers are closing stores and cutting jobs.

Tuna Amobi, an equity analyst with CFRA Research in New York, said the mass hiring is likely due to a shortage of employees at Amazon and to the company's rapid growth.

""I think what is even more remarkable is that a lot these employees are going to be full time. You know, usually, we don't see that many full-time employees get hired by any one company,"" he said in an interview with CBS News. ""It also speaks to Amazon's strategic vision as to its underlying confidence that its business is going to continue to grow.""

Amobi believes Amazon also wants to hire thousands of people next week in order bring the new employees aboard before other retailers hire them for the upcoming holiday shopping season.

Amazon has long been known for investing the money it makes back into its businesses. Part of that involves opening new warehouses, or fulfillment centers, and filling them with employees.

In the company's most recent earnings statement, for example, Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos said the company had hired more than 30,000 new employees and opened three new Amazon Books stores,"" among other expansion moves.

As a result Amazon has often reported quarterly losses, even as revenue grows.

The number of full-time and part-time workers at Amazon has swelled from 56,000 at the end of 2011 to more than 340,000 last year. In roughly the same period, the number of people employed by the parent company of Sears and Kmart has been slashed in half to about 140,000.

The job fair, which takes place on Wednesday, will include tours and sessions with company representatives. Job prospects will also be introduced to robots and other automation technology Amazon uses at its warehouse operations. The hires will help the company build out its infrastructure, capability and logistics.

Amazon said its jobs offer health insurance, disability insurance, retirement savings plans and company stock. Pay differs based on location, according to job postings on Amazon's site. It is offering a starting rate of $13 an hour for a full-time job in Baltimore and $12.25 an hour for a similar position in Kenosha, Wisconsin."

Branagh directed the film and stars as legendary detective Hercule Poirot, who stops the titular train after a passenger turns up dead.

The all-star cast includes Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley, Penelope Cruz, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Josh Gad and Leslie Odom Jr.

This version of the story will be scarier than previous incarnations, like the 1974 film adaptation directed by Sidney Lumet.

""I think what I found in the book again, and in the screenplay, was that it unleashed something very primal, very kind of grisly,"" Branagh told Entertainment Weekly. ""I realized that we could find a way to have the fun of Agatha Christie, but have the absolutely deadly intention behind it, and the danger.

""I think we're making a scarier film than people might imagine,"" he said. ""We're not trying to turn it into something it isn't, but I think we're away from the drawing room mystery, and we're into something [else]. Because the book is also a dark psychological revenge drama.""

Buress sat down with ""CBS This Morning: Saturday"" co-host Anthony Mason to talk about his recent leap to the silver screen, his start in comedy and about that one riff in Philadelphia three years ago that brought him so much unexpected attention.

Buress said that growing up in Chicago, you had to be quick.

""You have to be. It's just where I come from in Chicago. You had to be funny to be around,"" Buress said.

Buress went to Southern Illinois University to study business, but had trouble in Carbondale with a class called finite math.

""Finite math was insane. And I took it twice. I failed it the first time and took it again. And then I said, 'I guess -- I guess business isn't for me,'"" Buress said.

What's finite math? Buress still doesn't know.

He'd make his first stand-up appearance in college at open mic night.

""I remember gettin' off the stage and sittin' down and just -- my leg was shakin' from adrenaline. I just remember this leg, I was sittin' down and it wouldn't stop shakin,"" Buress said. ""It was just, it was addicting and I just wanted to do it all the time. And from there I just researched everything I could about comedy.""

A savvy self-promoter, he alerted the college paper, the Daily Egyptian, whenever he got a big gig.

""Who else gonna do it, for a comedian that's a year in?"" Buress said. ""They need stuff to write about in Carbondale. You just tell 'em what's going on, and they're like, 'Sure!'""



Buress slowly developed a following in Chicago. And in 2008, he moved to New York, performing at the Knitting Factory.

""It's kinda where I really built a fan base in New York,"" Buress said of the Brooklyn venue.

He worked on his routine, at times doing five or six shows a night. In 2014, Buress set off a different kind of bomb with a riff about Bill Cosby's fatherly image.

Recorded on a smartphone, the clip went viral and became a flashpoint, as rape allegations engulfed Cosby. It was not the kind of attention Buress was after.

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/north-korea-tests-missile-that-could-threaten-los-angeles-chicago-or-new-york/,cbsnews,"North Korea tests missile that could threaten Los Angeles, Chicago or New York",['Margaret Brennan'],"WASHINGTON -- North Korea launched another sophisticated missile Friday, one that could potentially hit the mainland U.S.

The rare late-night launch sent a ballistic missile into space. It remained airborne for more than 40 minutes, flying 1,000 kilometers due east before splashing into the Sea of Japan.

It was the second successful intercontinental ballistic missile test within the past month, and it flew longer and farther than any previous missile.

Pentagon intelligence analysts have been surprised by the fast technical advances made by North Korea's weapons scientists.

Recent North Korean propaganda videos have featured the U.S. Capitol in flames. Analysts believe that the missile launched Friday had the range to hit Los Angeles, Chicago or even New York.

It is unclear how close North Korea is to being able to arm a missile with a nuclear warhead.

""They've been saying it for a long time. I think the difference is we're coming to believe them,"" said arms control analyst Jeffrey Lewis.

""We're in a relationship where we can destroy them, and they can destroy us, and we may not like it but that's where we are,"" he said.

Late Friday, President Trump released a statement on the launch, which read in part, ""By threatening the world, these weapons and tests further isolate North Korea, weaken its economy, and deprive its people. The United States will take all necessary steps to ensure the security of the American homeland and protect our allies in the region.""

The Pentagon said the launch did not pose an immediate threat to the U.S. but the missile came very close to U.S. ally Japan. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called it a serious and real threat.

U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Joseph Dunford discussed military responses with his South Korean counterpart.

In a show of force, the U.S. and South Korean militaries staged a joint missile exercise in direct response to North Korea. It happened as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is still trying to free three Americans being held captive there."
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/crypto-outbreaks-swimming-pools-cryptosporidium-parasite/,cbsnews,"""Crypto"" outbreaks in swimming pools on the rise",['Ashley Welch'],"With summer quickly approaching, there's some nasty news to consider before heading to the pool.

Outbreaks of a parasitic infection tied to swimming pools and water parks are on the rise, with twice as many outbreaks in 2016 as in 2014, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The CDC received reports of at least 32 outbreaks caused by Cryptosporidium — also known as ""Crypto"" — linked to swimming pools or water playgrounds in the U.S. in 2016, compared with 16 outbreaks in 2014.

The parasite can spread when people swallow something that has come into contact with feces from an infected person, such as pool water contaminated with diarrhea.

For comparison, there were 20 Crypto outbreaks in the U.S. in 2011, 16 in 2012, and 13 in 2013.

Crypto is not easily killed by chlorine and can survive up to 10 days even in properly treated water. It is the most common cause of diarrheal illness and outbreaks linked to swimming pools or water playgrounds.

Swallowing just a mouthful of Crypt-contaminated water can leave otherwise healthy people sick for up to three weeks. Symptoms include watery diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea, or vomiting, and can lead to dehydration.

""To help protect your family and friends from Crypto and other diarrhea-causing germs, do not swim or let your kids swim if sick with diarrhea,"" Michele Hlavsa, R.N., M.P.H., chief of CDC's Healthy Swimming Program, said in a statement. ""Protect yourself from getting sick by not swallowing the water in which you swim.""

The CDC is also urging everyone to do their part in preventing the spread of germs in swimming pools and other recreational water.

While standard levels of chlorine kill most germs within a few minutes, Crypto can be extremely hard to kill. The CDC recommends closing a pool and treating the water with high levels of chlorine, called hyperchlorination, when responding to a diarrheal incident in the water or a Crypto outbreak.

To protect your family and others while swimming the CDC recommends the following tips:"

A world-class athlete is developing an unconventional approach in Wyoming by taking addicts outdoors.

CBS News correspondent Jeff Glor reports exposing addicts to the elements could help them recover.

Jackson Hole is one of the most exclusive resort locations in the world. It's a destination for extreme wealth and extreme athletes. The combination of skiing, climbing and hiking might be unparalleled. But the highs that come from adventure sports often lead thrill seekers to crave the same rush off the mountain.

That's where the problem -- and perhaps the solution -- starts. It's an unusual approach to an agonizing issue.

By putting people's hearts under extreme pressure, Ryan Burke believes he can retrain their brains.

""You know, outpatient or addiction therapy in the past has been a lot of talk,"" Burke said. ""You know, a lot of, let's just sit around in a circle and chat about that, which is important. But it's more important to go out there and practice that skill under pressure to know what the body feels like and to know what you're capable of dealing with.""

Burke is a world-class endurance athlete who holds several mountain triathlon records. But he's not interested in sponsors or endorsement deals. He's dedicated his career to addiction counseling, pioneering an approach called Mind Strength.

CBS News

""Mind Strength is a mental fitness program that pairs athletes and addicts in an attempt to get them to stay calm under pressure,"" Burke said. ""And put them under simulated exposure. So they know what fear feels like. So when the time hits, when they're life is actually on the line, whether in the wilderness or a wild party, they can stay in control.""

Andrew Shorts, a client of Burke's, grew up in Jackson and was a world-class skier by the age of 17 -- before his burgeoning career suddenly went off track.

""The skiing culture does encourage people to the phrase is 'go hard or go home,'"" Shorts said. ""And that came from skiing and sort of transitioned into my partying and my drinking and drug use.""

""It's interesting,"" he added. ""It's a very smooth transition as radical as it sounds talking about it now. A couple of years later, but you don't realize what's going on until you're kind of in the thick of it.""

Now, three years sober, Shorts is making his way back to competition with Burke's help.

Mind Strength does things like send people into bitingly cold lake water, asks them to hold their breath and tie a climbers knot underwater. Recovering addicts also join partner athletes to run blindfolded, balance on a ball and problem solve with a highly-elevated heart rate. Routines informed by Burke's own life experience.

""When I started to see the challenge of me, I'd say over drinking, you know, abusing, on the cusp of addiction,"" Burke said. ""I was on the border of having a very big problem. I pulled myself back. And the mountains helped me do that.""

Meditation is another part of the program. Two of Burke's favorite sayings are ""slower is faster"" and ""patience is progress.""

""Whether you're working at a desk in New York or down in Florida on the beach, we all have an overactive mind,"" Burke said. ""And the ability to slow that mind down is beneficial for everyone.""

""Quiet the brain,"" he added. ""I use motion analogy. Everyone is usually on the surface and the waves are really big. You have conflict in your life. But there's a quiet part of your brain, you know, that part beneath the surface that's even five, 10 feet deep, that wants to be calm. To bring people to that level, it makes a higher quality human being I believe.""

Burke has lost friends and clients to the overdoses, which have more than tripled in Wyoming since 2005. The people Glor talked with say attitudes have shifted, and a problem that was once ignored is now being discussed widely."

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obamacare-repeal-bill-fails-in-senate-vote/,cbsnews,Obamacare repeal bill fails in Senate vote,['Rebecca Shabad'],"A proposal that would partially repeal Obamacare fell short of the 51 votes needed to pass it Wednesday afternoon, dealing yet another blow to the GOP effort to roll back the 2010 health care law.

The Senate rejected the plan in a 45-55 vote. All Democrats voted against it, along with seven Republicans. They are:

Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-West Virginia



Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine



Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona

Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada



Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio



Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee



Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska



All of them except Collins voted in favor of a nearly identical proposal two years ago.

Republicans needed a simple majority, 51 votes, rather than a supermajority to pass it because they were using the budget reconciliation process.

The vote was among a number of amendments that are being debated and voted on in the Senate this week as Republicans try to find consensus on a repeal plan.

The text of the legislation mirrors a bill that the Senate passed in 2015 that President Obama then vetoed. Under the measure, most of Obamacare would be repealed, but that wouldn't take effect for two years, giving Republicans time to come up with a replacement plan.

Three Senate Republicans came out against this idea last week: Susan Collins, Shelley Moore Capito and Lisa Murkowski. This plan could also be even more complicated if Democrats retake control of any part of Congress in 2019. CBO projected earlier this month that 32 million more people would be left without health insurance in 2026.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, was a major proponent of this repeal plan because it delivered what he called a ""clean repeal"" of the law. It went further than other Republican proposals in terms of repealing the law.

The vote was originally scheduled for earlier in the day, but it was delayed until the afternoon so that a procedural issue could be hashed out.

This comes a day after Senate Republicans' most comprehensive plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), failed 43-57 late Tuesday after it required 60 votes. This contained a proposal from Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, that would allow insurers to sell less expensive bare-bones plans alongside plans that comply with stricter Obamacare standards. And a proposal was added from Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, that would ""assist low-income people moving off of Medicaid and onto private insurance plans,"" according to an aide to McConnell.

The last option that Republicans are discussing is a so-called ""skinny repeal,"" which would repeal Obamacare's individual and employer mandates as well as the medical device tax. They want to wrap in any provision that could qualify for only 51 votes. Senate Republicans say this would allow them to move to a conference committee and further negotiate a deal with House Republicans.

The chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, however, Rep. Mark Meadows, said that the ""skinny repeal"" couldn't pass the House.

""Oh, no. There's zero chance,"" he told reporters.

Asked if he's okay with a conference committee, he added, ""Yeah. I would prefer they get a deal done before and that way we do an up or down over here. But if it's coming back skinny it won't be an up or down vote.""

Stars Matthew McConaughey, who plays rags-to-riches businessman Kenny Wells, and Bryce Dallas Howard, who plays Kenny’s girlfriend Kay, talked to CBS News about what got them excited for their roles when they read the script.

McConaughey said he was attracted to Wells’ scrappiness.

In the film, Wells is a bald and paunchy down-on-his-luck businessman who has a dream about finding gold. The prospector is determined to make good on his dream and dig for gold with his partner, geologist Michael Acosta, in Indonesia and comes up against a few big-time Wall Street investors along the way.

“This guy, Kenny Wells, is chasing down this dream that he literally had -- chasing down a literal dream that he had -- believing in it it all the way to the death. He would die for this dream. And that’s how he lives. He would cheat death to achieve this dream,” said McConaughey. “What a pure spirit, too -- a guy who has no trouble turning down $300 million to buy out his company but yet can barely speak and is sweating when he’s going to receive Prospector of the Year award in front of his friends in Reno, Nevada. That’s a pure soul.”

McConaughey added that he can relate to Wells in that he never allows himself to rest on his laurels: “On a daily basis, I know I’ve got work to do. I know I’ve got places where I can improve.”

In contrast, Howard said what attracted her most to the role of Kay was her satisfaction with her life. In the film, Kay, who has stayed with Wells through all of his low points, proves to be far tougher than she appears.

“I loved that we weren’t seeing a woman who’s dissatisfied,” said Howard. “We’re seeing a woman who’s fulfilled in her life and it’s Kenny, really, who’s figuring things out.”

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-judge-blocks-arkansas-from-enforcing-4-abortion-restrictions/,cbsnews,Federal judge blocks Arkansas from enforcing 4 abortion restrictions,[],"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A federal judge has blocked Arkansas from enforcing four new abortion restrictions, including a ban on a common second trimester procedure and a fetal remains law that opponents say would effectively require a partner's consent before a woman could get an abortion.

U.S. District Court Judge Kristine Baker issued a preliminary injunction late Friday night against the new restrictions, three of which were set to take effect Tuesday. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Reproductive Rights had challenged the measures, suing on behalf of Dr. Frederick Hopkins, a Little Rock abortion provider.

The laws include a ban on a procedure known as dilation and evacuation. Abortion-rights supporters contend it's the safest and most common procedure used in second-trimester abortions. Similar bans are in effect in Mississippi and West Virginia and have been blocked by court rulings in Alabama, Kansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma. A ban approved in Texas will take effect in September and is also being challenged in court. The groups said the ban would have a devastating impact, while the state argued that alternative procedures are available.

""The threatened harm to Dr. Hopkins and the fraction of women for whom the Mandate is relevant clearly outweighs whatever damage or harm a proposed injunction may cause the State of Arkansas,"" Baker wrote in her ruling.

The attorney general's office did not have an immediate comment on the ruling. Attorneys for the ACLU of Arkansas did not immediately reply to messages early Saturday morning.

Baker's ruling also halts a law that would impose new restrictions on the disposal of fetal tissue from abortions. The plaintiffs argued that it could also block access by requiring notification of a third party, such as the woman's sexual partner or her parents, to determine what happens to the fetal remains. The state has said the law doesn't require permission or notice from those third parties before an abortion and includes several provisions that ensure notice or consent isn't required to dispose of the fetal remains.

Baker said the disposal law's requirements would dissuade doctors from performing abortions and create significant delays for women seeking the procedure.

""For these reasons, the Court is not convinced that importing the (disposal law's) complex requirements for authorization advances a public health goal,"" Baker wrote. ""These requirements also do not advance interests in women's health because delay and other negative effects instead threaten women's health and wellbeing.""

Baker also blocked part of a law set to take effect in January that would ban abortions based solely on the fetus' sex. The groups are challenging the law's requirement that a doctor performing the abortion first request records related to the entire pregnancy history of the woman. The plaintiffs say the requirement would violate a patient's privacy and indefinitely delay a woman's access to abortion.

The judge also blocked a law that would expand a requirement that physicians performing abortions for patients under 14 take certain steps to preserve embryonic or fetal tissue and notify police where the minor resides. The new measure, which was also set to take effect Tuesday, would have raised the age requirement to less than 17 years of age.

The ruling came hours after a federal appeals court panel cleared the way for Arkansas to enforce a law that will limit how the abortion pill can be administered. The panel lifted Baker's order blocking the 2015 law requiring doctors who provide such pills to maintain a contract with another physician who has admitting privileges at a hospital and who agrees to handle any complications. The state can't enforce the abortion pill restrictions until the appeals panel's ruling takes effect in about two or three weeks."
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/security-researchers-hack-atm-to-make-it-spew-cash/,cbsnews,Security researchers hack ATM to make it spew cash,['Alfred Ng'],"Never say your machine can't be hacked.

That's perhaps one of the lessons ATM maker Diebold Nixdorf learned after security researchers showed how they could turn one of the company's machines into a cash fountain. A simple hack of an exposed USB in one of Diebold Nixdorf's popular Opteva ATMs allowed researchers at security company IOActive to get it to spew out cash until it was empty.

During IOActive's ""Breaking Embedded Devices"" panel at Black Hat on Wednesday, researchers showed that it's not just computers, phones and servers that can be exploited -- it's anything with a chip or an internet connection, no matter how small its function.

Embedded systems, as the term denotes, are mass produced systems that only have a single role in a machine, whether it's to dispense cash or check how much ink is in your printer. Because they have such simple jobs, security often isn't a priority.

But IOActive showed at Black Hat that a machine's security is only as strong as its weakest link, and embedded systems make for easy targets.

In the past, we've seen researchers use vulnerabilities to hijack cars, smart homes and guns. Connected toys have shown that they still have a security roadblock to overcome. And the majority of people are nervous that their smart refrigerator or connected diaper pads will get hacked.

The ATM hack is just the latest example of how security, especially when it comes to the little things, can get overlooked.

""Challenge accepted""

Mike Davis, the director of embedded systems security at IOActive, said he reached out to Diebold Nixdorf multiple times about the vulnerability. He said he told the company that it had a security flaw near the ATM's speakers in the upper section. The same spot provided an opening for potential hackers to loosen and expose a USB port.

""It's a little bit like a magic trick, but no kidding, it took seconds to getting the ATM to open,"" Davis said.

When Diebold Nixdorf learned about the opening, Davis said, the company ""didn't consider it enough of a security issue to address,"" because it believed only the bottom portion of the ATM needed to be secured -- where the cash is stored.

IOActive said the company argued that the vulnerability wouldn't allow anyone to steal any money because the cash is safely locked in the bottom.

""We decided to say OK, challenge accepted. We're pretty sure we can just ask it to give us the money,"" Davis said.

The team -- Davis and IOActive's Josh Hammond -- plugged a netbook to the exposed USB port and injected in code to the ATM's Automatic Funds Distributor, a bot on the embedded system that decides how much money to send out. It reverse-engineered the bot and tricked the machine to empty out its entire stash.

Since being able to swindle Diebold Nixdorf's ATMs, IOActive said it's been trying to work with the company to test out security flaws on its other machines. According to iOActive, Diebold declined the help, saying IOActive had only hacked an outdated ATM.

A spokeswoman for Diebold Nixdorf said the machine IOActive hacked was from between 2008 and 2009, and never received any security patches or maintenance.

""Like any connected device that does not receive proper maintenance and patching -- especially one nearly 10 years old -- the risk for it to be compromised increases,"" the spokeswoman said.

Diebold Nixdorf was unable to say how many of its ATMs from 2008 to 2009 are still in use and added that in most cases, it's up to financial institutions to keep software up to date. It's unclear if the vulnerability has since been fixed.

“The Handmaiden” is an erotic, high-tension thriller and love story between two young women set in Korea during the Japanese occupation. Park, through an interpreter, talked to CBS News about the film and the legacy of “Oldboy.”

You based the screenplay on the novel, “The Fingersmith.” What about the book attracted you?

I like the fact that in the novel, you’re going through a narrative from one person’s perspective and as a reader, you’re following the story from that person’s perspective, then you come to the shocking conclusion where the story goes and then you go all the way back to the beginning of the story, but this time from a different perspective. You witness the same events and find all these pieces of the puzzle and put it together.

Magnolia Pictures

How did you come up with the idea to put it in colonial-era Korea?

A BBC miniseries had already adapted the book so when we were thinking we need to set it in a different environment, because we’re Korean, it was natural to think of Korea first. When we thought about setting the story in Korea, there were some elements we needed: class structure of ladies and maids and mental hospitals. These were the most important elements of the story, and looking at different stages of Korean history where these two elements could coexist was the time of Japanese occupation. It ended up helping us and allowing for a number of different layers to come into the story.

If you look at the big picture, this is a love story between a Japanese person and a Korean person and in the original novel, it has a difference between classes, but with this setting, I was also allowed to give the two people a difference in nationalities, which is yet another obstacle for them to find love between not just two different nations but two that are enemies. I thought that would make the dynamic very interesting.

Why didn’t you choose to cast any Japanese actors in the film?

Because this character Hideko is somebody who has come to Korea and has grown up surrounded by Koreans and she’s somebody who is very fluent in both Korean and Japanese. For her, Japanese language is something that feels forced on her because she’s forced to do these readings of erotic literature which she finds disgusting and horrible.

It has a negative image for her, so in this context, rather than cast a Japanese actress and training her to speak Korean, considering this is a film that will be released in Korea for the Korean audience, first and foremost, casting the Korean actress and training her in Japanese language would make more sense.

Having said that, I wanted to make as much of an effort as I could to make sure even fully a Japanese audience, the issue of language would be as small as possible and that meant I had her rigorously trained in Japanese language so that as much as she could, she would sound authentic.

South Korea is very conservative and in this film there’s lesbian sex and violence. How was the movie received?

I actually observed a phenomenon where young girls would take their moms to the movie and contrary to their expectations, their mothers would say, “This film is beautiful. It’s about love.” And in Korea, grannies who get together for lunch and a movie -- I’ve heard that a lot of them are getting together to see this. And while it is true that Korean society is quite conservative, it is also very dynamic and constantly changing.

Compared to how much I was concerned right at the beginning, this movie came up against no opposition and no hatred. I don’t think it’s particularly because I made a really good film or anything like that. This is a big commercial film in Korea, but it’s not the first film to address homosexual love.

What did you think of the American adaptation of “Oldboy”?

It’s a well-known fact that in America a lot of audiences don’t like seeing foreign language films and don’t like having to read subtitles when they go see a movie and about the situation, it’s not something to complain about because it’s not going to change. It’s just the way things are and if through a remake, more Americans can learn about my original film because they’ve seen the film and realize it’s a remake, then that’s great.

But what about the film itself?

I haven’t seen it yet. When it was released, I had so many things going on at the time so I missed the opportunity. When I was studying film, Spike Lee was one of my heroes. He was one of the most pioneering filmmakers of the day and all the actors in that film were actors I really liked as well. It made me really want to see it. It still makes me want to see it.

But whether it’s good or bad, I imagine I’ll have a strange feeling if I get the chance to see it. It would be kind of like seeing myself in a distorted mirror, to see a distorted image of myself and to see this movie that takes the world I created and changes things here and there. I think it would feel strange. It’s like a woman putting on the same makeup every day and having a stranger put it on for her and put a mirror in front of her and say, “Here -- have a look.” That’s the kind of feeling I imagine.

The biggest changes come to Siri, Apple's voice assistant; some redesigns, like to the lock screen, App Store and Control Center; and augmented reality (AR) software that's going to mesh the virtual world onto your own.

All these updates and more will bring a wave of new features to your device, and — even more exciting to tech-watchers — to Apple's next iPhones. For that reason, iOS 11 is especially important. As the operating system set to power the hotly-anticipated 10th anniversary iPhone, changes to iOS drop some major hints about what the iPhone 8 (or whatever Apple calls it) will be able to do.

The iPhone is Apple's most popular device, and also its biggest moneymaker. (iPhones make up more than two-thirds of Apple's total sales, including laptops.) But phone sales have dropped in the past four out of five quarters, despite the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus's popularity. iOS 11 could help lure buyers by reinvigorating the software innards behind the next iPhone's hardware shell.

What's new in iOS 11

AR is coming to your iPhone and iPad

When you look at your iPhone or iPad screen, you'll be able to interact with virtual items overlaid in your real world. For example, you can place items like a lamp in your living room, or see Pokemon monsters on the sidewalk at your feet

Apple is just now launching the developer platform (called ARKit), so this isn't something you'll be able to use right away. (My guess is September when we expect Apple to launch its next iPhones.)

Why we care: This kind of deep software supports rumors that Apple is going to add a lot more computing power to the iPhone camera.

Siri wants to suggest what you want next

Siri can now translate languages (English to Chinese, French, German, Italian, Spanish for starters)

Suggest topics you'll want to know based on what you're doing

Siri will learn words from articles you use, and suggest them when you type

Make a calendar appointment based on what you searched on the web

Private, for you and your devices only (it won't be web accessible)

Why we care: Apple's Siri assistant has lagged behind Google's (and even Amazon's Alexa). Prediction and translation help close the gap a little.

Camera app changes mean more pics for you

Images will take up a lot less storage space thanks to new compression technology

Low-light photos using optical image stabilization

The two cameras on the iPhone 7 Plus captures depth info. Now devs can access that and use in apps

Live photos can now be trimmed

Why we care: The most important change is that you'll be able to save a lot more photos and videos.

Control Center shrinks to a single panel

One panel instead of three

3D Touch is going to let you dive in to more granular controls

Why we care: The three-panel layout was a drag. This should be easier to use by putting the controls we care about in one place, not three.

Lock screen and notification center become one

Scroll up to see notifications from the lock screen

Still get widgets on the left and camera on the right

Why we care: This should give you a more convenient glance at alerts.

Photos can get more dynamic

You can loop a live photo to make a movie (like, of a never-ending bubble blow)

You can grab and save a still frame from a video

New long exposure effect can help you take really great nature shots of moving water and more

Movies captured in ""Memories"" will now play in Portrait mode, not just landscape

Why we care: Nothing here really stands out yet, but looping a live video seems like an easy way to make a hilarious GIF.

iMessages will sync convos better

When you sync into another new device, iCloud will sync all your messages (which also means if you delete it on the iPhone, it'll delete on your laptop and iPad, etc.)



Why we care: Less clutter.

Use Apple Pay to pay your friends

Peer-to-peer payments are right in iMessage

You can make purchases and bank transfers

Authenticate with your fingerprint

iOS devices and Apple Watch 2

QuickType keyboard will suggest that you pay your friend... within the message

Why we care: You can pay your buddy back for dinner without having to sign into a new service. Easy.

Apple Maps dives indoors

Detailed airport and mall floorplans (you can browse by floor)

Watch your speed because speed limits are part of Maps

There's also guidance to tell you which lane you'll need to change into

Why we care: You might not get as lost finding the pretzel stand on your way to the gate.

Apple Car Play adds ""Do Not Disturb"" mode

When you install iOS 11, you'll get a Do Not Disturb While Driving mode

It'll chop out notifications and show you... nothing. Because you're driving. Eyes on the road!

If you're actually not driving, you can tap to undo

There's an auto-response to let people know you're driving

Some special people will be able to get your attention if notices are urgent

Why we care: Distracted driving is bad news for road safety. This is a step in the right direction.

Apple music gets more shareable

Want to play music in multiple rooms through different speakers? You can now (through an AirPlay 2 protocol)

You can make playlists public to your friends

To make it more social, Apple is opening up Apple Music hook-ins to third-party apps, like Shazam

Why we care: You can set up surround sound music in your home with speakers you already have.

Stephen Lam/Reuters

Brand new App Store

Apple totally redesigned it

Separate tabs for Apps, Games and Today's featured apps

In-app purchases will also get a featured spot, like if there's a brand-new level or character they can buy



Why we care: If it helps makes new apps easier to find, that's fine by us.

iOS 11 takes iPad to the next level

The new app dock includes tricks like opening apps by pulling them up from the dock

A new app-switcher supports drag and drop (text, images, multi-select, you name it)

You can flick keys to access punctuation and numbers without having to switch views

A new app, Files, houses all files and folders to help you find everything on your iPad (supports Google Drive, Box, etc, too)

Apple Pencil has deep support for iPad

With Apple Pencil, you can markup pretty much anything

The Notes app supports in-line drawings, search and handwriting recognition with Apple Pencil

Why we care: The larger iPad screen means people use it differently than they do their phones. These changes can make the iPad easier to use and far more productive.

When do you get iOS 11?

Developers can start working with the iOS 11 beta today. The finished software will arrive to for new and existing devices in the fall.

We expect Apple to reveal next iPhone with iOS 11 this September, assuming the company sticks to its hardware update cycle. Apple's new iPads will ship with iOS 10 at first and then upgrade to iOS 11 in a few months.

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-travels-to-long-island-to-talk-about-ms-13-immigration/,cbsnews,"Trump travels to Long Island to talk about MS-13, immigration",[],"WASHINGTON -- Trumpeting his administration's crackdown on illegal immigration and violent crime, President Donald Trump is traveling to Long Island to urge Congress to dedicate more funding to the fight.

Mr. Trump is set to speak Friday afternoon at Suffolk County Community College in Brentwood, New York, close to where the ultra-violent street gang MS-13 has committed a string of gruesome murders, including the massacre of four young men in April in a Central Islip park.

President Trump is expected to continue his tough talk on immigration and urge Congress to dedicate more funding to border enforcement and faster deportations in a speech in front of law enforcement officers and the family members of crime victims.

He has made cracking down on MS-13, also called Mara Salvatrucha, a top priority of his administration. The gang, which is believed to have originated in immigrant communities in Los Angeles in the 1980s and then entrenched itself in Central America when its leaders were deported, is infamous for its violent tactics, including torturing victims and hacking them with machetes.

Its recruits are middle- and high-school students, predominantly in immigrant communities, who are said to risk violent retribution if they leave. Authorities estimate the group has tens of thousands of members across several Central American countries and many U.S. states.

Mr. Trump's Justice and Homeland Security departments have made targeting the gang a top priority. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has directed his department's law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors across the country to prioritize their prosecution, as directed by an executive order Trump signed in February, among other measures.

""We're liberating our towns and we're liberating our cities. Can you believe we have to do that?"" Mr. Trump said at an Ohio rally earlier this week, adding that law enforcement agents were rooting out gang members - and ""not doing it in a politically correct fashion. We're doing it rough.""

""Our guys are rougher than their guys,"" he bragged.

Since the beginning of January the Department of Homeland Security's investigative unit has arrested 3,311 gang members across the country in a number of targeted operations, said Tom Homan, the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The agency could not provide numbers for a similar timeframe in 2016.

The president's trip comes as Sessions is visiting El Salvador as part of a mission to increase international cooperation against the gang. Sessions met Thursday with his Salvadoran counterpart and members of an international anti-gang task force.

Congressman Peter King, who represents Brentwood and will travel with the president from Washington, said that Trump's appearance would send a signal to communities that have been shaken by the violent killings.

""It's absolutely devastating. And almost all of these killings have occurred in my district, within 20 minutes of my home,"" he said.

King said the gang is responsible for 17 murders between January 2016 and April 2017 in his district - but that the impact on largely immigrant communities has been larger because of the way the gang kills. In addition to torturing victims, King said, members have also sent video of gruesome crime scenes to their victims' loved ones

""This gang's chilling motto is 'mata, viola, controla,'which means 'kill, rape and control,'"" said Robert Hur, a top official at the Justice Department. ""They seek to live up to this motto through truly shocking acts of violence designed to instill fear: vicious machete attacks, execution-style gunshots, gang rape and human trafficking.""

The Trump administration blames the gang's recent resurgence in certain areas on illegal immigration and believes policies like building a wall along the southern border and cracking down on so-called ""sanctuary cities"" will eradicate the problem.

Critics see the focus misplaced and argue resources could be better spent on other enforcement efforts."

The premiere will also feature an investigation into how foreign contractors are committing visa fraud to expand auto plants across the country on Monday, July 31, 2017, (10 p.m. ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network and on CBSN, the network's 24/7 streaming news service.

""CBSN: On Assignment"" is a new primetime summer series featuring experiential reports driven by fresh voices and perspectives from around the world. Each hour-long edition of the series will feature multiple stories and highlight CBSN's distinctive storytelling style, as reported by more than a dozen CBS News correspondents.

""The series will showcase stories that will personalize and bring viewers inside some of the heart-wrenching, complex, and interesting issues facing our country and the globe,"" said Executive Producer Mosheh Oinounou. ""Our goal is to bring unique voices and perspectives and a kind of immersive storytelling and production style not typically seen on network television.""

In the debut broadcast, Charlie D'Agata reports from Mosul, Iraq, where ISIS leaders have indoctrinated a generation of children into potential killers. D'Agata talks with a mom who fears her children were brainwashed by ISIS, and aid workers in desperate need of help.

From Japan, Adam Yamaguchi investigates the country's attempt to repopulate with robots as it faces one of the largest population collapses in modern history. He visits an abandoned school, closed because there aren't enough children to keep it open, and he gets an up-close look at the realistic-looking robots that some Japanese are now taking on as friends and roommates.

Also, in a CBS News investigation, Vladimir Duthiers looks into visa fraud and how foreign workers are expanding auto plants across America. CBS News spent five months reporting in Europe and in the United States on how foreign workers find jobs here and what it means for American labor.

""There is a real audience appetite for smart, immersive journalism,"" said Nancy Lane, Senior Executive Producer for CBS News Digital. ""This is another opportunity for audiences to experience the dynamic storytelling that CBSN offers in addition to its daily news coverage.""

In addition to being presented on the CBS Television Network, ""CBSN: On Assignment"" will be streamed on CBSN and to CBS All Access subscribers through the service's live streaming offering of local CBS stations.

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/wells-fargo-car-insurance-wrongly-charged-customers/,cbsnews,Wells Fargo admits it wrongly charged customers for car insurance,[],"NEW YORK – Wells Fargo, its reputation still stained from having opened millions of unauthorized customer accounts, is now having to apologize for another breach of trust.

The bank announced late Thursday that it will pay $80 million to customers who the bank signed up and charged for auto insurance that they did not want or need. Wells Fargo said that roughly 570,000 customers were affected and will be getting refunds.

Like most auto loan companies, Wells Fargo (WFC) required borrowers to have comprehensive and collision insurance. If they didn't have comprehensive coverage, Wells would purchase it for the customer and charge them for it as part of what it called its collateral protection insurance, or CPI, program.

Wells acknowledged its systems signed up customers who already had insurance. Worse, roughly 20,000 customers were unable to afford the car payment plus the insurance that some did not realize had been added to what they owed, and that ""may have contributed to a default that led to their vehicle's repossession,"" the bank said.

The problems with the insurance program were found in July 2016, Wells Fargo said, and it was discontinued in September of that year. The bank said it will start contacting affected customers in August.

""We take full responsibility for our failure to appropriately manage the CPI program and are extremely sorry for any harm this caused our customers, who expect and deserve better from us,"" said Franklin Codel, head of consumer lending at Wells Fargo.

Nearly a year ago, Wells Fargo admitted its employees opened up to 2 million accounts for customers without getting their permission in order to meet sales targets. An internal review by the bank found that employees had opened bogus accounts dating back to 2002.

The scandal eventually led to congressional investigations and the dismissal of CEO John Stumpf. The bank also paid $180 million in fines and penalties and recently reached a settlement to pay an additional $142 million to customers through a class-action lawsuit.

Wells Fargo shares fell $1.39, or 2.5 percent, to $53.32, in afternoon trading."

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/woman-loses-her-way-home-finds-much-more-steve-hartman-on-the-road/,cbsnews,"Woman loses her way home, but finds much more",['Steve Hartman'],"CLEVELAND -- There were two very different sides to 49-year-old Anita Hughes. At her church in Cleveland, she was a fearless hurricane. While at home, she's more like a stationary front.

As we first reported last year, she rarely left the house and wouldn't travel anywhere by herself. Which is why it was such a big deal when Anita decided to step way outside her comfort zone to take a trip on her own.

""I turned the ignition and I actually got on [Interstate] 77 South and I went,"" she said.

CBS News

She was headed for North Carolina for a gospel concert and she made it just fine. But on the way home she got so terribly lost, she didn't even know what state she was in.

So Anita pulled into a 7-Eleven in Strasburg, Virginia, to ask for directions. Surveillance video caught her entering the store. Unfortunately, there's no sound, but by all accounts, you could hear her desperation loud and clear.

""'Can somebody please tell me how get to Cleveland?!',"" Anita recalled asking.

""I mean, she came in full-throated, like a Broadway star on stage reaching the back row,"" said Jason Wright, a customer at the store.

He said he gave Anita directions, but she was still scared and skeptical.

""I said, 'If that's the right way, you come show me how to get to Cleveland.' So he did,"" Anita said.

""I mean, I'm going in the complete opposite direction,"" Jason said. ""I live here to the south. I'm driving north, so far out of my way.""

Jason drove 35 miles out of his way to get her back on track to Cleveland. And then a few days later he drove another 300 miles -- to take her to the moon.

CBS News

Obviously, Anita got a new friend -- and new confidence.

Anita agreed that Jason gave her a lot more than directions that day. ""Just a little bit of appliance of affection can change a whole situation,"" she said.

Since their chance encounter, Anita has taken many more trips and got a new job.

As for Jason, he's got a new mission, too. In the last year, Jason has given rides to more than a dozen other strangers. He records and treasures their stories.

Because, he says, if Anita taught him anything, it's that we have a lot more in common than we realize -- and we need to start living like it.

""We're brothers and sisters, and we really do have a responsibility to help one another get home,"" Jason said. And yes, he meant that metaphorically.

When one got lost, hope got found.

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/commentary-when-trump-fires-mueller/,cbsnews,Commentary: When Trump fires Mueller,['Will Rahn'],"Anthony Scaramucci's solid debut in the press briefing room on Friday must have provided some degree of comfort to Donald Trump, who otherwise can't be feeling great. He's finally dipping in the Rasmussen polls his media allies trust. The fractured state of the Republican caucus, which is making major legislative victories all but impossible, shows no signs of healing. And, of course, Robert Mueller's investigation will certainly go in directions he does not want.

It makes you wonder what Scaramucci must think about Mueller's investigation, the one Trump seemed unwilling to say he would end during that New York Times interview. As the shiniest, brightest, newest object in Trump's universe, Scaramucci must hold a degree of sway, particularly after an opening like that.

How will he use that influence in an administration brimming with so many rivalries? Which tribe does he go with, assuming he goes with a tribe at all?

Scaramucci opened his remarks by talking about how he loves Reince Priebus, who reportedly objected to his hiring, like a brother. Scaramucci was big on the L word: he loves Trump, he loves America, he loves Sarah Sanders and Hope Hicks and everyone else in the White House. He laid it on thick, but it kind of sounded like it was something approximating the truth.

What about Steve Bannon? When Scaramucci was asked, he praised Bannon's intelligence. ""One of the smartest people that I know,"" he said. No love, though. Scaramucci is a smart, confident, competitive guy. And smart, confident, competitive guys have a habit of complementing the intelligence of people they don't like. The subtext of his remarks, which included an odd riff about how wonderful Goldman Sachs was in the 1990s, was hard to miss.

Does that mean anything for the special counsel investigation? Bannon, after all, was one of the people who thought firing James Comey was a bad idea. It would make sense for him to think the same thing about firing Mueller. That situation could easily replicate itself; a faction in the White House supports Trump's instinct to fire Mueller, Bannon objects, and Mueller is dismissed anyway.

Scaramucci, right now at this early stage, feels like he could be one of those unorthodox Trump hires that looks smart in hindsight. He has a real aura of competence, something always in short supply. He seems like someone who could ably defend the indefensible.

Trump can't fire Mueller directly; Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein can, since the special counsel is subordinate to the Department of Justice, and Jeff Sessions has recused himself, to Trump's continuing dismay. He'd need grounds to do so, though, and Rosenstein doesn't seem like a guy who'd go along with that. So let's just assume Trump needs to fire Rosenstein, too, and find someone else to dress up the dismissal in legalese.

And let's also figure that Sessions doesn't go along with Mueller's firing, either. Good riddance, you can imagine Trump thinking. Now I can get an attorney general who will defend me, who will work for me, who will do his job.

If all this happens, Washington would be apoplectic. There would be calls for Trump to step down. Republicans would distance themselves. He'd lose even more support in Congress. The press would rightly call it an abuse of power.

But one can imagine Trump thinking, so what? He's lived through that movie numerous times already. Even Reince wanted him to quit the race just weeks before Election Day. And yet the bully-move almost always works, does it not? What are the real-world consequences Trump faced for doing all the things people told him he couldn't do?

Impeachment? Unlikely, assuming Trump holds on to his base, which has stuck with him through all the other nightmares. A 25th Amendment removal? Good luck with that. The base sticks with him, the cable hosts defend him, Scaramucci goes out there with his Harvard Law degree and slickly explains how Mueller went beyond the confines of his investigation.

This is all to say that it's more likely than not that Trump fires Mueller. Yes, that probably triggers some kind of Saturday Night Massacre do-over. But Trump isn't Nixon. These are different presidents, different men, inhabiting starkly different countries.

It's one of those paradoxes of the Trump presidency. Firing Mueller would seem, on the face of it, an insane thing to do. And yet it feels like the thing he will of course do.

What about this man, this presidency, would lead us to any other conclusion? And, more alarmingly, what makes any of us expect that it wouldn't work?"
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/apple-ipod-touch-ipod-nano-ipod-shuffle-product-line/,cbsnews,"Apple keeps iPod Touch, kills iPod Nano, iPod Shuffle from product line",[],"SAN FRANCISCO -- The iPod Nano and iPod Shuffle have played their final notes for Apple.

The company discontinued sales of the two music players Thursday in a move reflecting the waning popularity of the devices in an era when most people store or stream their tunes on smartphones.

The iPod product line still remains alive, though. Apple plans to continue selling its internet-connected iPod Touch.

In a show of its commitment to the iPod Touch, Apple doubled the storage capacity of its top-of-line model to 128 gigabytes. That version costs $300. An iPod Touch with 32 gigabytes of storage sells for $200.

The Nano and Shuffle came out in 2005 as less expensive and smaller alternatives to Apple's standard iPod. The Cupertino, California, company stopped updating the Nano and Shuffle several years ago.

Apple has long predicted iPods would gradually fade away as more people bought iPhones or other smartphones capable of playing music.

The company's sales of iPods peaked in its fiscal year 2008 when the devices generated revenue of $9.2 billion. The then-nascent iPhone accounted for $1.8 billion in revenue that same year.

Last year, the iPhone generated revenue of nearly $136 billion. Sales of iPods have plunged by so much that Apple no longer provides specifics about the devices in its financial statements."

Kelly's departure will leave an immediate vacancy at the department. His last day will be Monday, July 31, at which point Deputy Secretary Elaine Duke will become acting secretary, DHS press secretary Dave Lapan said in a statement Friday. Duke was sworn in on April 10.

Kelly's permanent replacement will require Senate confirmation. A role in the administration may look less appealing than it did several months ago, with the president having fired his FBI director and acting attorney general and many other senior administration officials submitting resignations.

Kelly released a statement on his departure from the department Friday evening, thanking ""the tremendous men and women of DHS.""

""I thank you for the opportunity to serve as your Secretary. When I left the Marines, I never thought I would find as committed, as professional, as patriotic a group of individuals,"" the retired four-star general wrote. ""I was wrong. You accomplish great things everyday defending our nation and I know your exceptional work will continue.""

The vacancy comes at a time when the U.S. is facing the threat of a nuclear-capable North Korea, homegrown terrorism and other serious national security issues. House Homeland Security Committee Ranking Member Bennie Thompson (D-Mississippi), told CBS News the president's decision was ""rushed.""

""Unfortunately, It is clear that this decision was rushed and not well thought out,"" Thompson said. ""The president and Republicans insisted the DHS secretary be confirmed on day one but now the president leaves this critical national security cabinet post vacant. He must now quickly replace Secretary Kelly with someone experienced and measured who understands that homeland security is not a partisan issue.""

DHS did not immediately return a request for comment."

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/watch-judge-allows-defendant-to-meet-newborn-son-in-court/,cbsnews,Watch: Judge allows defendant to meet newborn son in court,['Crimesider Staff'],"LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A Kentucky judge was a part of an emotional courtroom scene last week when she allowed a burglary suspect to meet his newborn son for the first time as she looked on from the bench.

Judge Amber Wolf had previously issued a no-contact order between James Roeder and his wife Ashley, who are co-defendants in a Jefferson County burglary case, reports CBS affiliate WKYT. But she made a special exception to the order after Ashley Roeder gave birth as the case against the couple was still pending.

On Friday, when both husband and wife were scheduled for back-to-back hearings, Wolf asked Ashley Roeder if she would allow her husband to come into the courtroom to meet the infant, who was with her.

""She called my attorney up to the bench and whispered something to him, and he came to me and said, would you have any objections to James seeing his son, and I said absolutely not,"" Ashley Roeder told the station.

WLKY

In courtroom video, Wolf asks Ashely Roeder, ""You're sure you're comfortable with this? Is this what you want to do?"" before calling her husband into court.

Wolf made it clear that she wasn't suspending the no-contact order, but rather making a one-time exception so James Roeder could meet his son before being transferred to Todd County. Roeder also faces charges in the southern Kentucky county, reports CBS affiliate WLKY.

""I'm making a temporary exception right now, in front of me, on the record, so you can meet this baby,"" Wolf says. ""This is your son.""

Ashley Roeder gives her husband the baby, and James Roeder is seen holding and kissing the infant. He, his wife and Wolf all apparently tear up during the emotional introduction.

""Thank you for letting me be a part of that,"" Wolf tells Ashley Roeder after her husband was escorted outside. ""....Congratulations again.""

Wolf later said when she heard James Roeder had not yet seen the one-month-old child, she saw an opportunity to make that happen and she didn't want to pass on it, reports WKYT.

After both Roeders left court, Wolf is heard telling staff, ""If y'all aren't teared up, you're just heartless.""

It's not the first time Wolf's compassion in the courtroom has drawn the national spotlight. She made headlines last week when she became furious that jail staff apparently hadn't given pants to a woman who appeared in her courtroom. Wolf phoned jail officials during the hearing and demanded an explanation."

Big-time beat. Facebook's income surged 71 percent to $3.89 billion, or $1.32 per share, while revenue surged 45 percent to $9.32 billion. That topped Wall Street forecasts of a per share profit of $1.13 and $9.2 billion in sales. As far as market analysts are concerned, that's a huge earnings beat. Investors are generally happy when Fortune 500 companies exceed profit forecast by a penny or two.

It's all about mobile. Demand for mobile advertising on Facebook was so strong that it offset a bigger-than-expected drop in desktop and payment revenue. Ad sales were up by 43 percent or more in every geography where it operates. Facebook also posted a better-than-expected gross margin of 86.7 percent and lower-than-expected operating expenses of $3.68 billion. That's a high-performance machine in action.

More (more, more!) users. Facebook reported more than 2 billion monthly active users, up from 1.9 billion last quarter and 1.7 billion a year ago. Again, this closely watched metric exceeded analysts' forecasts, and is especially noteworthy given Twitter's and Snap's struggles. ""We can think of no other company that reaches as many users for 50 minutes each day,"" Martin said in a note.

Future's so bright. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is pushing Facebook into video, including episodic television-like shows that will one-day compete with Netflix and Alphabet's YouTube. Videos encourage users to stay on websites longer than they would otherwise, a plus for advertisers. He also is monetizing the company's popular Messenger application and its WhatsApp and Instagram services, which analysts expect will pay off big in the coming years.

Top of the heap. Simply, Facebook has no real competitors, at least not in the short-term. A day after Facebook blew Wall Street's mind, Twitter shares are down nearly 15 percent after the microblogging site reported lower-than-expected user growth. Money-losing Snap's stock is trading below its $17 IPO price, a sign that investors lack confidence in the prospects for its Snapchat app. By contrast, Facebook shares have surged 42 percent this year and is trading at an all-time high. The social media giant has also lapped the S&P 500, which has gained about 11 percent since January."
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-zealand-warns-about-synthetic-marijuana-after-9-deaths/,cbsnews,New Zealand warns about synthetic marijuana after 9 deaths,[],"WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- New Zealand officials on Friday were urging people to stop smoking synthetic marijuana after finding nine people had died after using the drug this month in the nation's largest city.

The latest was a 31-year-old woman who died Thursday evening in Auckland. Police suspect she was smoking synthetic marijuana shortly before her death though other factors may have contributed.

Synthetic marijuana is made with chemicals similar to those found in natural marijuana to give users a high. It is illegal in New Zealand, where authorities say the drug is dangerous and is sometimes laced with other chemicals.

Chief Coroner Judge Deborah Marshall said the drug can cause seizures and many people have been hospitalized after using it.

""While the police and coronial investigations are still at an early stage, and the final causes of death have yet to be established, the number of cases where synthetic cannabis appears to have been a contributing factor has prompted me to issue this public warning,"" Marshall said in a statement last week, before the latest two deaths.

Police say they're aware of speculation a specific ""bad batch"" may have caused the deaths but they don't have any scientific proof of that.

Acting Detective Inspector Peter Florence said Friday police were taking the problem seriously and doing everything they could to get the drug off the streets.

""Every day, police officers across the country are conducting search warrants and seizing synthetic cannabis and we are continuing to put suppliers and manufacturers before the courts,"" he said in a statement."

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/scientists-build-dna-from-scratch-to-alter-lifes-blueprint/,cbsnews,Scientists build DNA from scratch to alter life's blueprint,[],"NEW YORK -- At Jef Boeke's lab, you can whiff an odor that seems out of place, as if they were baking bread here.

But he and his colleagues are cooking up something else altogether: yeast that works with chunks of man-made DNA.

Scientists have long been able to make specific changes in the DNA code. Now, they're taking the more radical step of starting over, and building redesigned life forms from scratch. Boeke, a researcher at New York University, directs an international team of 11 labs on four continents working to ""rewrite"" the yeast genome, following a detailed plan they published in March.

Their work is part of a bold and controversial pursuit aimed at creating custom-made DNA codes to be inserted into living cells to change how they function, or even provide a treatment for diseases. It could also someday help give scientists the profound and unsettling ability to create entirely new organisms.

The genome is the entire genetic code of a living thing. Learning how to make one from scratch, Boeke said, means ""you really can construct something that's completely new.""

The research may reveal basic, hidden rules that govern the structure and functioning of genomes. But it also opens the door to life with new and useful characteristics, like microbes or mammal cells that are better than current ones at pumping out medications in pharmaceutical factories, or new vaccines. The right modifications might make yeast efficiently produce new biofuels, Boeke says.

Some scientists look further into the future and see things like trees that purify water supplies and plants that detect explosives at airports and shopping malls.

Also on the horizon is redesigning human DNA. That's not to make genetically altered people, scientists stress. Instead, the synthetic DNA would be put into cells, to make them better at pumping out pharmaceutical proteins, for example, or perhaps to engineer stem cells as a safer source of lab-grown tissue and organs for transplanting into patients.

Some have found the idea of remaking human DNA disconcerting, and scientists plan to get guidance from ethicists and the public before they try it.

Still, redesigning DNA is alarming to some. Laurie Zoloth of Northwestern University, a bioethicist who's been following the effort, is concerned about making organisms with ""properties we cannot fully know."" And the work would disturb people who believe creating life from scratch would give humans unwarranted power, she said.

""It is not only a science project,"" Zoloth said in an email. ""It is an ethical and moral and theological proposal of significant proportions.""

Rewritten DNA has already been put to work in viruses and bacteria. Australian scientists recently announced that they'd built the genome of the Zika virus in a lab, for example, to better understand it and get clues for new treatments.

At Harvard University, Jeffrey Way and Pamela Silver are working toward developing a harmless strain of salmonella to use as a vaccine against food poisoning from salmonella and E. coli, as well as the diarrhea-causing disease called shigella.

A key goal is to prevent the strain from turning harmful as a result of picking up DNA from other bacteria. That requires changing its genome in 30,000 places.

""The only practical way to do that,"" Way says, ""is to synthesize it from scratch.""

The cutting edge for redesigning a genome, though, is yeast. Its genome is bigger and more complex than the viral and bacterial codes altered so far. But it's well-understood and yeast will readily swap man-made DNA for its own.

Still, rewriting the yeast genome is a huge job.

It's like a chain with 12 million chemical links, known by the letters, A, C, G and T. That's less than one-hundredth the size of the human genome, which has 3.2 billion links. But it's still such a big job that Boeke's lab and scientists in the United States, Australia, China, Singapore, and the United Kingdom are splitting up the work. By the time the new yeast genome is completed, researchers will have added, deleted or altered about a million DNA letters.

Boeke compares a genome to a book with many chapters, and researchers are coming out with a new edition, with chapters that allow the book to do something it couldn't do before.

To redesign a particular stretch of yeast DNA, scientists begin with its sequence of code letters - nature's own recipe. They load that sequence into a computer, then tell the computer to make specific kinds of changes. For example one change might let them rearrange the order of genes, which might reveal strategies to make yeast grow better, says NYU researcher Leslie Mitchell.

Once the changes are made, the new sequence used as a blueprint. It is sent to a company that builds chunks of DNA containing the new sequence. Then these short chunks are joined together in the lab to build ever longer strands.

The project has so far reported building about one-third of the yeast genome. Boeke hopes the rest of the construction will be done by the end of the year. But he says it will take longer to test the new DNA and fix problems, and to finally combine the various chunks into a complete synthetic genome.

Last year, Boeke and others announced a separate effort, what is now called Genome Project-write or GP-write . It is chiefly focused on cutting the cost of building and testing large genomes, including human ones, by more than 1,000-fold within 10 years. The project is still seeking funding.

In the meantime, leaders of GP-write have started discussions of ethical, legal and social issues. And they realize the idea of making a human genome is a sensitive one.

""The notion that we could actually write a human genome is simultaneously thrilling to some and not so thrilling to others,"" Boeke said. ""So we recognize this is going to take a lot of discussion."""

He’s adding to the growing list with his latest lead role in the new film, “Run the Tide.”

In the movie, Lautner plays Reymund, a man who kidnaps his younger brother, Oliver (Nico Christou), after their drug-abusing mother (Constance Zimmer) is released from prison, determined to rebuild the family. The brothers embark on an emotional journey away from their desert home to the California coast.

“I knew this would be challenging for me because it is an emotional ride for my character, Rey,” Lautner told CBS News. “That is kind of what attracted me to it. It scared me, I didn’t know if I could do it. That made me want to hold my breath and go for it.”

Momentum Pictures

The story draws from the real-life experiences of the film’s screenwriter, Rajiv Shah. Lautner says he was able to connect with the emotions not just from talking with Shah but also through being an older brother himself.

“I have a sister who is seven years younger than me, and we are extremely close. So right when I first met Nico, we hit it off and got along and became buds,” Lautner said.

“I became very protective of Nico. I mean, I couldn’t help it. I remember one day we filmed this scene that gets really physical. When we weren’t filming it, though, we could not talk to each other. They literally would call cut and we had to walk away. It was heartbreaking to have gone through that. “

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/report-russia-used-fake-facebook-accounts-to-spy-on-macron-campaign/,cbsnews,Report: Russia used fake Facebook accounts to spy on Macron campaign,['Stefan Becket'],"Operatives linked to Russian intelligence used fake Facebook accounts to surveil associates of French President Emmanuel Macron ahead of his election in May, according to a new report.

Citing a member of Congress and two people familiar with the matter, Reuters reports that Russian intelligence agents created about two dozen phony personas to infiltrate and monitor the social networks of campaign officials and others close to Macron.

Macron defeated far-right candidate Marine Le Pen in a resounding victory in the second round of the French presidential election in May.

A representative for Facebook confirmed to CBS News the company detected organized attempts to seek out individuals in France as early as December. The representative declined to specify the number of accounts suspected in the spying operation and said Facebook took steps to stop the effort at the time.

The operation involved the creation of accounts impersonating friends of friends of Macron officials and using them to glean personal information from the associates, Reuters said. Facebook employees determined the ultimate goal may have been to obtain officials' login information or get them to install malicious programs, according to anonymous officials briefed on the matter who spoke to Reuters.

The apparent use of fake accounts to surveil campaign officials -- as opposed to simply spreading misinformation or spamming -- represents another potential weapon in the arsenal of Russia's cyber operations.

Facebook alerted congressional investigators about the effort, Reuters says. Employees apparently traced the spying campaign to the GRU, Russia's military intelligence unit that U.S. intelligence believes was behind the hack of the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.

The Facebook spokesman told CBS News the company could not confirm whether the spying campaign was traced to the GRU, as Reuters reported.

The French government has not publicly blamed Russia for a last-minute dump of hacked emails from Macron campaign officials 36 hours before polls opened, which was widely seen as an attempt to influence the outcome. However, Macron blasted Russian media outlets Sputnik and Russia Today for reporting ""serious untruths"" during the presidential campaign after his first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in May.

In April, Facebook acknowledged that fake accounts were being used to disseminate misinformation ahead of the French election. The company announced at the time it had removed 30,000 users in France suspected of being fake as part of a larger effort to purge phony users. Reuters reports the number of phony accounts removed in France for spreading spam or propaganda had climbed to as high as 70,000, a figure Facebook did not dispute.

The purge of fake accounts included millions of accounts that had liked the Facebook pages of major publishers, as CBS News has reported. In May, USA Today asked the FBI to investigate the spamming operation that swamped its pages with phony likes. Those accounts primarily originated from Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh and a handful of other countries."
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/house-republicans-dumbfounded-by-failure-to-repeal-obamacare-in-senate/,cbsnews,House Republicans dumbfounded by failure to repeal Obamacare in Senate,['Rebecca Shabad'],"House Republicans appeared dumbfounded Friday as they digested the news that their Senate counterparts failed to deliver an Obamacare repeal plan across the finish line.

There are deep divisions within the House Republican Conference about what comes next.

Some say the ball is still in the Senate's court for dealing with the 2010 health care law. Others suggest it's time for bipartisan negotiations to fix Obamacare's vulnerabilities. And still others said they have no idea what the next step should be, admitting that they've hit a dead end.

House Republicans discussed the situation Friday morning at a closed-door conference meeting and the mood was ""somber,"" Rep. Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, said afterward.

""I think we expected that the Senate would get something done and most of us expected to be here to deal with it,"" said Cole, who added that he's worried about the political implications for Republicans up for re-election in 2018.

Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, on Friday praised the House for passing a health care measure in early May, but said, ""I am disappointed and frustrated, but we should not give up,"" and he urged the Senate to keep working toward a solution.

""People here in Washington need to keep their eye on the ball,"" said Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-New Jersey, who helped craft a proposal that helped House Republicans find consensus on their repeal-and-replace plan earlier this year.

""It took Democrats 50 years to socialize medicine,"" said Rep. Raúl R. Labrador, R- Idaho, Friday. ""I think we can take a little bit of time to protect the American people.""

House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-North Carolina, said Friday that Republicans have to ""regroup"" and find a strategy that can get 51 votes in the Senate.

""We had an infamous Friday as well,"" he said, recalling the day in March when the plan in the House collapsed because GOP leaders were unable to secure enough votes for passage.

Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Alabama, said Friday that the Senate is obstructing the conservative agenda and President Trump's agenda.

""It starts at the top with Mitch McConnell and it goes all the way down to the bottom, the newest senator, Luther Strange. We need new leadership in the United States Senate. If Mitch McConnell cannot get the job done then those 52 Republican senators have got to get together and try to figure out who amongst them have the leadership capability of getting the job done,"" he said.

Asked if Mr. Trump did enough to coordinate with Senate Republicans, Brooks said, ""It's quite clear that nobody did enough in the House, the Senate and the White House...Collectively, we're supposed to be a team.""

Some members said, however, that now it's time to reach across the aisle.

""I think that we should work in a bipartisan capacity,"" said Rep. Leonard Lance, R-New Jersey.

""Right now, I think there's a great opportunity to enter into a bipartisan center of discussion on health care reform. That's where I think we go from here,"" said Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pennsylvania, the chairman of the moderate Tuesday Group caucus.

Some possible next steps, he said, could include stabilizing the individual market, maybe repealing the medical device tax and reforming the employer mandate.

Republicans warned that if the status quo remains, that the entire health care system would implode, as the president has suggested.

The House, for its part, leaves Friday for its month-long August recess and won't return until the beginning of September, during which time lawmakers will face a slew of deadlines to pass a government funding package and prevent a shutdown and to lift the debt ceiling.

The Senate, meanwhile, will return to Washington next week for additional votes on nominations and a defense policy bill. It will also eventually go on recess until September."

But Dern, who is a mother of two, is using her name to help mothers and children who are underserved and underprivileged around the world through the Global Moms Relay campaign with Johnson & Johnson and the United Nations Foundation.

Dern talked to CBS News about her work with Global Moms Relay, what she loved about ""Big Little Lies"" and what's in store for ""Twin Peaks"" and ""The Last Jedi.""

Tell me about your Global Moms Relay partnership.

They reached out to me because I feel like I sit paralyzed by the news, like so many of us, wondering how I can make a difference, and Johnson & Johnson and the United Nations Foundation have said we can make a difference and you can make a difference by liking a photo. You can make a difference by sharing your story or sharing what you're doing. Go to GlobalMomsRelay.org. Read about us, share it, like it and we will donate money to these amazing five non-profits who are doing beautiful work.

Also, I had such a great experience last night and this morning with my daughter -- to say to a 12-year-old, ""OK, you're on your phone anyway, here's what you're going to do, you're going to go to this website."" In the middle of it she was like, ""Oh my God, Mom, I'm reading about 'Girl Up.' If I like this photo, a girl in Guatemala is going to get a bicycle and be able to go to school.'"" And that practical application of being of service, of making a difference with a minute of your day I think is a really inspiring way not only to think about becoming educated about what others need but actually make the difference.

As a mom, what do you see with the children these organizations help that really makes you think, ""Wow, my kids get that and they don't""?

Today is a very important day in America so I think we're all thinking about what we know to be true. I've never met a person who would disagree with this, despite their politics, and that is every child should have the human right to health care.

Every child should be cared for and have an education. I don't even understand an argument to that. It's inhumane. So that piece at this moment feels like the most essential story to tell. But through these specific organizations, we're looking at the work to prevent malaria, the discussion of maternity mortality, the discussion of girls' education, vaccines -- all of those issues and questions come up and that could make a difference specifically in those areas.

How has having kids changed the way you see the world?

I started activism work in the area of environmental health and worked with an organization I love very much called Healthy Child. I know how much it took me to become educated about our environment and how we were poisoning ourselves and how we could create a healthy environment.

Then I became a mom and realized the impact that the environment has on my children's daily life and that kind made me feel more of that ""time's running out"" feeling and when I looked in my child's eyes, I could promise what feels like an essential right, which is, ""Baby, I will give you a clean glass of water today,"" and ""Baby, I will give you food to eat today."" That millions of mothers don't have that luxury is a tragedy and that it's considered a luxury is a tragedy. That shifted for me, imagining what it must feel like to have your heart break when you look in your kid's eyes and you can't provide essential things to keep them alive.

You just came off Season 1 of ""Big Little Lies,"" which examines a very different kind of mom -- rich moms in the suburbs and their rivalries and issues. Is there anything about that show that rings true to you as a mom?

That none of us get to control the outcome of our children's stories. For my character, she has all the money in the world and power and influence and a voice that won't stop, and her child is unsafe in her own classroom and that's just breaking her apart. That part is very relatable, I think, to all of us.

And feeling like you can't juggle being powerful and perhaps even ambitious and goal-setting in your career and be what's perceived as ""a good mom."" That's not something that men have to consider. It's not a question of career versus parenting, and I think women feel a lot of shame around that, like they're leaving something they should be doing instead of doing what you and I are doing right now.

The show has been such a critical hit. When you first saw the script, did you feel that there was something special about it?

I did. We had made the film ""Wild"" and it was the same director, director of photography, Reese [Witherspoon] and myself and the same producers -- Reese and her partner, Bruno Papandrea. That felt like coming home again. That was already special, but then I was close with Shailene [Woodley] and Nicole [Kidman] as well, and suddenly this group of friends were going to work together and that was miraculous.

Do you plan to come back for Season 2?

I am excited about the conversation, so we'll see what they come up with.

And then the women will all be friends, which would be different.

It would be very cool to see where we go from here, right?

Speaking of Shailene Woodley, you played her mom in another movie. How was it playing a mom alongside her this time?

Really fun. I love both Shailene and Reese personally like family so having those two specifically be my enemies for a chunk of the series was kind of hilarious and fantastic.

It's taken on this ""Sex and the City"" role in pop culture where people are like, ""I'm such a Madeline, I'm such a Renata."" Who are you on the show?

Well, I love that the other girls are saying if they could play another part they would play Renata. It makes me feel so lucky because I just love playing that part so much and it is such a deliciously fun part.

I think what moves me about Shailene's character is considering being a single mom and wanting to be really present for your kids and not define them by projecting onto them what we think we're putting onto our kid, like, ""Oh, I'm like this or their father's like that so they're going to be A, B or C."" I really relate to that part of that character's story, and I was raised by a single mom so that story moves me a lot and that boy is such an amazing actor.

But also my kids are still little but I'm very heartbroken of the story of Madeline considering her daughter growing up and leaving. I remember myself and another dear friend of mine who's an actor, when we were 20 years old we were talking about a therapist who said that some parents have what's called ""anticipatory nostalgia,"" where you're already anticipating something that might happen years from now, and the example they used was when you're 20 years old and you're already thinking about how heartbroken you'll be when your son goes to college. That stuck in my head because I remember being 20 and thinking, ""That'll be the worst day of my life,"" but it's coming closer and closer. It's shocking, thinking of releasing your children into the world of adults.

You're playing an admiral in ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi,"" but your character has been described as very feminine. How do you enjoy playing another strong female character who still values her femininity?

I haven't read that description, actually, so I can't comment on who I'm playing. I don't know if that's the correct description, but what I can say that I love about ""The Last Jedi"" is that it empowers female characters -- girls and women -- and minorities and an iconic female character like Carrie Fisher gave us. Part of the legacy of ""Star Wars"" is that women are not just part of the story, they make the story and the mythology of the story. That's always been there thanks to George Lucas and this invention. Being part of that is really exciting and how they are flipping the script in terms of diversity in various roles. I feel super proud to be part of it.

And it's May the 4th, too.

Yeah, May the 4th be with you!

What can you tell us about ""Twin Peaks""?

Also nothing! I'm as excited as you to find out because I know nothing and none of us know anything. We know what we did in it, but no one read other scripts or really knows who else everyone's playing, so I feel like a kid in a candy store to see how it unfolds, because David Lynch is such a genius."

But he does know fashion. Siriano recently revealed his fall line during New York Fashion Week. The theme was “The Desert,” and backstage he was surprisingly cool.

“I try to be a little Zen. I really can’t stress myself out so much. But that five minutes before, when we’re really, like, getting dressed and ready, that’s when it’s scary.”

Fashion is a high-stakes business, but Siriano is willing to take risks. Take a close look at the runway models: they are all shapes, shades and sizes, and it’s all by design.

“I don’t care what size they are, I don’t care where they’re from. I just want them to feel good in what we’re creating for them,” he said.

That attitude is what brought Siriano to fashion in the first place. Born in Annapolis, Md., he was 13 when he started designing clothes, inspired by his size 16 mother and size 2 sister.

“I had every color, ethnicity, every size, every person around me. So it just wasn’t different. I think that that’s what I’m trying to get people used to, that it should just be the norm. It doesn’t have to be, like, a topic.”

Siriano’s creativity was encouraged by his parents, and in 2004 he moved to London where he interned with celebrated designers Vivienne Westwood and Alexander McQueen.

But when Siriano returned home, he struggled to find work, until he auditioned for the fashion competition show, “Project Runway.”

His highly-theatrical approach to clothing earned him a lot of attention. He became the show’s youngest winner, an experience he looks back on with mixed emotions. “That’s like an actress who can’t stand to be known for a film that she did her whole career, you know? That can be frustrating. But I definitely think now I probably wouldn’t do it.”

“But you wouldn’t be where you are,” Altschul said.

“I definitely would be in a different place than I am now.”

Siriano has had his hits and (some think) misses, like this dress worn by actress Christina Hendricks at the 2010 Golden Globes (left).

“We got a lot of hate on that dress. Tons of hate. People hated it! [Someone] said, ‘Don’t put a big girl in a big dress.’”

But it meant the world to him last summer when Michelle Obama appeared at the Democratic National Convention clad in a classic blue dress he designed. “I’m okay with saying that that definitely changed my career.”

Emboldened by success, Siriano willingly broke the high-fashion mold by dressing “Saturday Night Live” actress Leslie Jones, for her 2016 “Ghostbusters” premiere, after her tweet revealed that other designers declined.

And he capped the year off with his marriage to singer-songwriter Brad Walsh.

On the red carpet, the runway, or anywhere, Christian Siriano has made his mark as a designer for every body, like it or not.

Altschul asked, “So when people say, ‘Oh, how could you do that?,’ of course you’re going to take it personally?”

“Yeah. You take it really personally. But then you do it again!” he laughed. “My always thing is, if I waited around for certain people to come around and support [me], I’d still be waiting.”

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/video-starbucks-customer-fight-armed-robbery-ryan-michael-flores-fresno-california/,cbsnews,Dramatic video shows Starbucks customer fighting off armed robber,[],"FRESNO, Calif. -- Police in Fresno, California, have released dramatic surveillance footage showing a customer stepping in to prevent an armed robbery at a Starbucks.

Authorities said the video shows a hero taking down a man who will soon face many felony charges, CBS affiliate KGPE-TV in Fresno reports.

Cregg Jerri, 58, was enjoying his Starbucks order and working on his iPad at 5:30 p.m. on Thursday when a man holding a yellow bag and wearing an Optimus Prime Transformers mask entered the store. The suspect demanded money and began threatening the clerk with a fake gun and a buck knife.

Police said Jerri came swooping in, hitting the suspect with a chair from behind in an attempt to stop the robbery. A fight ensued, and Jerri was stabbed in the neck during the struggle, but he wrestled the knife away from the suspect, who eventually fled the scene.

KGPE-TV

Police later arrested the suspect and identified him as 30-year-old Ryan Michael Flores.

""There's probably not very many people in America who would do what Cregg Jerri did last night,"" Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer told reporters. ""It was incredibly heroic and the way most people would think that they would respond but may not have the courage to respond.""

Both Jerri and the suspect were sent to the hospital with injuries. Jerri needed six staples in his neck to mend the stab wound, but police said he is expected to make a full recovery.

Meanwhile, Flores is in critical, but stable condition. Police said he will be sent to jail as soon as he recovers."
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-kors-still-on-the-cutting-edge/,cbsnews,Michael Kors: Still on the cutting edge,[],"Michael Kors made a name for himself designing clothes for celebrities. But he’s made his fortune with clothes that are “ready to wear” by anyone. He shares his secrets with Rita Braver:

Backstage, the models are frantically prepping to walk the runway. But out in the house where the show will start in just minutes, one man is surprisingly serene:

“Over 35 years of putting on fashion shows, and I don’t get nervous,” said Michael Kors. “But I guess I’m kind of like the expectant dad, you know? This thing has been a long time coming and you want to see that gorgeous baby.”

And indeed, even hardened fashion critics agreed, it was gorgeous! Rufus Wainright sang his heart out, A-Listers like Emily Blunt and Sienna Miller studded the first row, and models of the moment (like Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid) strutted their stuff.

Fifty-seven-year-old Michael Kors took a victory lap, and why not? It’s been quite a journey.

He showed his first season when he was 21 years old, “and by the time the clothes arrived in the stores, I was 22,” he told Braver. “I knew nothing, I have to tell you. I don’t know what UPS was. I mean, I didn’t know how you actually delivered the clothes to the stores!”

Born on suburban Long Island, he started out as Karl Anderson. But his Mom let him change both his first and last names when she remarried.

And that wasn’t all: at age 5, she brought him to a fitting for her wedding gown.

“And I just sat in the corner making a face,” he recalled. “And my mom said, ‘What’s wrong?’ And I said, ‘I don’t know, it’s just way too busy -- it had a lot of bows.’ And I said, ‘You know what? I think it would look better without the bows.’”

Within a few years of graduating high school, he was working at a Manhattan shop where the owners gave him a chance to design his own creations.

CBS News

The response to the pieces the boutique started having made based on his designs was “Amazing,” he said. “I mean, it was crazy. We’d put it in the window and you know (snaps his fingers) you immediately knew a woman would come in and say, ‘Oh, can I try it on?’ And you’d say, ‘Wait, I’m on to something here; let’s do more of that.’”

His fledgling line caught the eye of one of fashion’s most powerful prognosticators: Anna Wintour, then at New York Magazine:

“I took the collection and I kind of packed it into these big, messy garment bags, and I jumped on the subway, and I went off to see Anna. And I remember it was her fall issue of New York Magazine, and I was her fashion thing to look forward to.”

Today, as Editor-in-chief of Vogue, Wintour still cares enough for Kors to step out on the red carpet with him at a fundraiser he’s hosting for his favorite charity, God’s Love We Deliver, which provides meals to the sick. And yes, she’s wearing Michael Kors.

Braver asked, “What is about his work that you like? What gets you into a Michael Kors?”

“I think Michael has always understood the modern American woman, that he is trying to make her look the best that she can,” Wintour replied. “He’s less concerned about clothes wearing a woman. He wants the woman to wear the clothes.”

And it doesn’t hurt that some of those women are celebrities: Michelle Obama (in her first official portrait), Viola Davis (at this year’s Golden Globes), and Kate Hudson (on many occasions).

“When a woman puts something on, and her whole body changes and her energy changes and her confidence changes, he feels like he’s succeeded,” Hudson said. “And he really, really lives and breathes it.”

There are a lot of boldface names in the world of Michael Kors, such as the outfit Blake Lively wore while pregnant: “She wore it during the day and threw, like, a grey hoodie over it.”

At his flagship store on Madison Avenue, Kors proudly shows off his couture line: sumptuous fabrics, with prices to match.

“The handwork, all of this, is all done by hand,” Kors said.

“This dress must cost thousands of dollars,” said Braver.

“It does. It does. But you’ll have it forever.” And the stretchy fabric will keep fitting.

But the bulk of his sales -- and most of the almost 800 other Michael Kors stores -- are devoted to his lower-priced lines. He also designs clothes for men. But, Kors says, his clients all have similar aspirations: “They want to look fashionable and current. They want to feel powerful but sexy. They want to feel youthful but not ridiculous.”

CBS News

It seems hard to imagine, but at one time, Kors almost lost it all. In the early 1990s, the chief backer for his lower-priced line suddenly ran out of money.

“I remember thinking, ‘Well, if this doesn’t work, like, will I still be me? Will I still be Michael Kors? What will I do?’”

“It must have been so scary for you.”

“Scary. And what I learned from it is, you really have to stick to your guts. You know, you’ve got to stay focused.”

He rebuilt the brand, and then in 2004 he got a call that would change his life: “Certainly, reality television and fashion had not merged,” Kors said of “Project Runway.” “And I knew ‘Survivor.’ And I said, ‘Are designers gonna be, you know, eating bugs and killing each other? What are they gonna be doing?’ I thought it was insane!”

The show, which judged the work of aspiring designers, took off, in part, because of now-legendary quips by Kors like, “It’s tablecloth-y to me.”

But after 10 years, Kors left the show to spend more time on his business, and his marriage with Lance LaPere, his one-time intern who is now creative director of the company.

Braver asked LaPere, “Do you ever tell him, ‘I don’t think so, that’s not a good idea’?”

“Oh, yeah. All the time,” he replied. “It’s always a back and forth.”

And these days, with a net worth estimated at $1 billion, life is very bright for Michael Kors:

“I am still so curious about what is next, and what’s new,” he said. “I think when you lose that curiosity, you know, quite frankly, then you need to do something else. But I feel more juice today than I did when I was 21.”

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-sanctions-bill-american-european-businesses-impact/,cbsnews,"Russia sanctions could affect American, European businesses","[""Charlie D'Agata""]","MOSCOW -- A bill that would slap new economic sanctions on Russia for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election is hung up in the Senate. Some senators consider the bill too broad because it targets North Korea and Iran as well.

Understandably, the Russians don't like it either. Some of America's European allies are also opposed.

Senior Russian officials say the new sanctions make ""no sense"" and move already tense U.S. relations into ""uncharted territory.""

Andrei Kortunov, director of a prominent Russian think tank, told CBS News that Russians aren't happy being ""thrown into the same basket"" as Iran and North Korea.

CBS News

""So basically the signal is that you three bad guys, you will get the same treatment from the United States Congress, and with all due respect, but Russia is not North Korea,"" Kortunov said.

But the sanctions also have some unintended consequences. The bill, as written now, targets any company that contributes to the maintenance or construction of Russia's energy export pipelines. Instead of just punishing the Russians, they snare European and American business in their web.

The vast Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany has huge financial stakes for more than a dozen European energy companies.

""'America first' cannot mean Europe's interests come last"" complained Jean Claude Juncker, the EU's chief executive.

Alexis Rodzianko, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Moscow, said American companies would also pay a price.

""The ability to do business of large U.S. investment banks and global investment banks has been affected the most by sanctions,"" Rodzianko said.

Nobody knows how Russian President Vladimir Putin will react, but a Kremlin spokesman said Wednesday that Putin will wait until the new measures become law and then act accordingly."

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-delivers-the-first-model-3-sedans/,cbsnews,Tesla delivers the first Model 3 sedans,['Tim Stevens'],"It's been a long time coming for Tesla fans who've been counting the days since Tesla opened up pre-orders for the Model 3 in early 2016, but the wait is over. Tesla has delivered the first Model 3 sedans to consumers and production is now rapidly accelerating towards full-swing. That's good news for those who pre-ordered their cars early, but the good news for everyone is that we finally have the answers we've all been waiting for -- and some impressions from behind the wheel, too.

Pricing and performance

Tesla's Model 3 will start at $35,000. That's before federal or state incentives, which could subtract thousands more from the price of the car. Its formal range is 220 miles, but those wanting more can step up to the Long Range edition. That adds $9,000 to the price and 90 miles to the tank, meaning you're starting at $44,000 if you want to go 310 miles on a charge.

Reuters Staff

Elon Musk had originally said there would be few configurations of the Model 3 available initially, and indeed there are, with only the Long Range car available at launch. Buyers will have a choice of six colors -- black is standard, but there are two silvers, a blue, a red and a white if you're willing to spend $1,000 more. You can then spend an extra $1,500 for 19-inch wheels and pay a further $5,000 for the Premium Upgrades package, which includes power-adjustable and heated seats, a better sound system, LED lighting and a tinted glass roof -- which you're probably going to want if you plan to drive anywhere the sun rises.

But you're not done yet. Tesla's Autopilot, which allows for advanced driver assistance on the highway and well-marked back roads, will set you back $5,000. If you want to roll the dice and add the extra sensors to enable future full autonomy when Tesla finishes developing it, that'll be another $3,000.

All told, if you tick all the boxes you come in at $59,500. That's about $10,000 cheaper than the most affordable Model S that is currently available, the the 249-mile Model S 75. I'd still call that a very good deal for what you get, though not quite the value proposition of that $35,000 starter edition.

The Model 3 will accelerate to 60 in 5.6 seconds by default and whirr its way up to a top speed of 130 mph. If you opt for the Long Range edition, however, and that drops to 5.1, the top speed rising modestly to 140 mph. Compare that to a top-shelf Model S P100D's 2.4-second 0 - 60 time and it may sound slow, but 5.1 seconds is more than respectable and, since this is an EV, the immediate throttle response means it feels much quicker.

Initial impressions

Numbers like range and price are hugely important when it comes to the success of an EV, but they only tell half the story -- and I'm very happy to report the other half of the tale is just as good.

The car automatically unlocks based on your proximity, connecting to your phone using Bluetooth LE -- yes, there isn't a physical key -- and the door handles are manual, unlike the auto-extending ones on the Model S. Push on the back and they swing out, much like the handles on a Nissan GT-R.

The Premium seats I sampled are low-slung and comfortable, and power-adjustable using traditional controls down to the left of the seat. When it comes to adjusting the steering wheel and the mirrors, that's when tradition goes out the window. There are two thumbwheels embedded in the spokes of the steering wheel that can be rolled up or down or pushed from side-to-side, much like many computer mice.

It's with these that you configure many more things in the car. Dig into the settings section of the 15-inch central display and you can select mirror adjustment mode. Here, the left wheel controls the left mirror, the right one controls the right. The same goes for adjusting the position of the steering wheel itself.

This is not only a novel and, eventually, intuitive solution, it reduces the number of physical controls that have to be added to the car. This means an interior that is not only visually more pure, but is also easier to manufacture. It's also cheaper. Even the air vents, which run the full width of the dashboard, are adjusted by that central touchscreen, not unlike the new Porsche Panamera.

Drive impressions

Interior impressions are nice, but of course I was itching to get going, and while I didn't have a huge amount of time with the car -- maybe 15 minutes total -- it was enough to get some solid impressions. And solid is a good way to describe the car. Despite being a fair bit smaller than the Model S, even more so than the X, it still feels roomy inside and drives with the same poise and composure as the bigger cars.

Acceleration is indeed less brisk than its bigger siblings, but that passenger-startling response that's a Tesla trademark is still here. I was able to zip through some increasingly dense traffic without issue, a quick flex of my right foot plenty enough to dive into any gap. On the move the Model 3 feels far more nimble than its 3,814 pounds would suggest (3,549 if you go for the shorter-range model), and with the battery pack down low it stays admirably flat in the turns.

The steering wheel is fat and deep and feels great in the hand, though I must admit the thumb wheels do feel a bit plasticy compared to the other materials, which are quite premium -- in the Premium trim, at least. Headliner, dash, seats and even the wood insets felt nice to the touch. It's definitely more than on par with cars available from the low $40,000 range.

And that single, central display? It does take some adjustment not having a traditional speedometer or the like behind the wheel, but I didn't mind it. In fact, I found myself a little less distracted as I wasn't constantly glancing down at my speed. Some drivers will surely struggle with it, though, and I still hope that Tesla offers a heads-up display at some point, but for me at least, it's not an issue.

Cargo and space concerns

Beyond the driving dynamics and price and everything else I was curious to know about, I was probably most concerned about two things: headroom in the rear seats and space in the trunk. I'm happy to report that both are non-issues.

I'm six feet tall, yet with my short legs I sit tall and often struggle to get comfortable in the rear seats of even full-size cars. I had no problem in the Model 3. Instead of a traditional roof liner, there's nothing but glass over your head in the back. While I do wonder what this'll mean on a hot, sunny day, it does make for some very lofty seating.

And then there's the trunk. Here I was concerned because the rear glass does not swivel upward, this is a sedan not a hatchback, and from looking at the earlier concepts it sure seemed like you'd be left with a narrow opening back there. But, the trunk, though shallow, opens up high and gets well out of the way. There's actually a very large trunk opening and a plenty-deep trunk.

Two bags of golf clubs should be no problem. I bet you could even manage four.

Production and delivery details

Tesla has repeatedly declined to give a formal update number of pre-orders in the system, but today Musk himself told us that the company has received ""somewhere over a half-million reservations."" 500,000 also happens to be the rate of annual production Musk hopes to be able to eventually achieve for the Model 3, which will be built at its Fremont factory along-side Models S and X.

But, it will take some time to get to that rate, and Musk says that if you were to place a deposit for the Model 3 today you should expect delivery at the end of 2018.

By the end of this year, Musk hopes to be building about 5,000 Model 3 sedans weekly. If you're a reservation-holder I'll let you do the math on when you can maybe, hopefully expect yours, but a lot of this assumes that the production ramp goes smoothly. ""It's an amazing car,"" Musk said, ""but we're going to go through at least six months now of manufacturing hell.""

That hell will include finding problems in the assembly process, optimizing efficiency and, quite likely, dealing with one or more suppliers failing to deliver their widgets with promised frequency. The Model X ""hell"" was infamous as Tesla struggled to get the SUVs out the door in any volume, but all those learnings went into the design of the Model 3. Everything from the simplification of the interior to the number of connections on the coolant system was minimized, all with the intend of making the car simple, fast and cheap to build.

Achievement unlocked

After the incessant delays of the Model S and Model X, cynicism around Tesla has evolved to something of a fever pitch. Tonight, with the delivery of the first Model 3 sedans, Tesla is also delivering on a promise and doing so with a car that's not only on time but really good. No, it isn't nicer or faster than the S or the X, but it isn't supposed to be.

Only time will tell on reliability of the car, and there will be some inevitable teething issues, but overall I'm impressed with what I've seen and felt. This is an EV that drives as good as it looks and is competitively priced. We've come to expect the first two things from Teslas of the past. It's good to finally add that third part to the equation."

Collecting lunar dust and rocks in a specially designed decontamination bag to bring home, the rocks became national treasures.

The bag -- not so much. It was forgotten about until resurfacing three years ago on a government auction website that space enthusiast Nancy Carlson liked to check out.

CBS News

""I did see a bag that was described as a lunar bag,"" she said. ""Flown. With a number on it. And it included the word moon dust.""

She quickly slapped down her $995, and a week later a brown box arrived. Inside the box: history.

Carlson said she ""loves it"" because ""it was like finding the Holy Grail.""

But ""found"" was almost ""lost"" again for Carlson. She'd matched a number on the bag to one on the Apollo 11 flight manifest, but wanted to be absolutely sure. She sent her bag off to NASA so it could test the dust embedded in the fabric.

""And that was where things started to go off the rails, to put it nicely,"" Carlson said.

NASA told Carlson that yes, her bag had been to the moon, but no, they would not be returning it since -- they said -- it never should've been sold to start with. Carlson had to sue to get her bag back.

She won, though the publicity convinced her the bag won't be safe in her home. So on Thursday, the 48th anniversary of the moon landing, Carlson will auction it off.

Cassandra Hatton, who is handling the sale for Sotheby's, said it is ""absolutely"" a one-of-kind item.

""I just say Neil Armstrong moon dust -- you get it,"" Hatton says. ""You don't have to be American to understand why this is so important and this is also what's exciting about this. I could talk to a 5-year-old in China, and they would get excited about this.""

The bag is expected to fetch $2-4 million -- not a bad return on Carlson's $995 investment.

""I found a piece of history that everybody forgot about,"" Carlson says. ""So that's my great gratification in all this. I saved it from being lost.""

Nearly half a century later, thanks to Nancy Carlson's internet trolling, there's a new footnote to the greatest adventure story in human history."

They are using new technology, including drones, to learn about the health of the ocean’s top predator. Phillips shows us how the Antarctic Ocean’s dwellers are experiencing the effects of climate change.



The ship that took a CBS News team to the U.S. research base at Palmer Station, Antarctica is not your average love boat. There’s some serious scientific work being done on this cruise, and the findings are not always happy ones, reports CBS News correspondent Mark Phillips.



The National Geographic Explorer is a different kind of adventure cruise ship. She’s on a whale hunt, cutting through the pack ice near the Antarctic Circle. The good ship Explorer is not just here for sightseeing, although there’s plenty to see.

CBS News

And while nobody shouts “Thar she blows,” when whales are spotted, this time in open water, people do jump into small boats to chase them, just like in the old days. This hunt, though, isn’t about killing whales; it’s about saving them. It’s about giving them a health check, and the prognosis isn’t particularly good.

CBS News

“One of the reasons we study top predators -- and killer whales are the top predator in the ocean -- is to understand the health of the ecosystem that supports them,” said John Durban. He and Holly Fearnbach are modern whale hunters who use the latest tools.



They use a drone fitted with equipment to monitor the whales’ condition.

“With a small drone like this, we can fly just a little over 100 feet -- the whales don’t know it’s there -- and we fly a camera much lower so the quality of the images are so much better,” Durban explained.

CBS News





The results are better pictures, but, it turns out, not better whales.



The images of one pod of killer whales were not encouraging, particularly for the adult female -- the mother of the family.

Research under NMFS





“What’s wrong with her?” Phillips asked.



“She’s very, very thin,” Fearnbach said.

Research under NMFS





“You could see just following her, her whole body profile, you could see her ribs really clearly, so she’s lost all of the fat along her entire body,” Fearnbach said.



“You’re looking at a dying whale here?” Phillips asked.





“Yes, you’re looking at a dying whale. And she has a dependent offspring, and so once the female dies, then she’s also going to lose her calf, so it’s very worrying,” Fearnbach said.

And it’s not just the size of the whales that Durban and Fearnbach are looking at. You wouldn’t think you could take health-analyzing samples from whales out here in the Antarctic Ocean, but you can. The team has developed a technique – here they’re using it in the Pacific – to actually breathalyze whales by flying through the cloud of mist they produce when they breathe.

Vancouver Aquarium / NOAA





“You can tell by flying through that cloud of whale breath, the exhalation of a whale… you’re picking up what’s inside the whale, is what you’re saying?” Phillips asked.



“Yeah. So these collection plates, like the one on the top here and the front here, they’re sterile, and we’re able to collect droplets of whale blow. And from that, we take them back to the lab and use genetic techniques to identify the microorganisms that are in that blow,” Durban explained.

It’s early in the program and Durban and Fearnbach are just building up a database of what comes out of a whale’s blowhole. But if a whale is unwell, the theory is you’d effectively be able to smell it on their breath.

In the meantime, they can only take an educated guess on why they’re finding sick whales in these pristine waters, which, like everywhere else, are getting warmer. The pack ice around which they normally hunt is not as abundant as it used to be; neither is the food they hunt for.

“Our hypothesis certainly is there’s… you know, a problem with their food supply, and… fewer seals. And that’s what we’ve been seeing so far this year,” Durban said.

“Less ice, fewer seals? Is that a leap?” Phillips asked.

“It’s certainly a hypothesis,” Durban said.

The next time Durban and Fearnbach are down this way, they’ll be looking for this family of whales, hoping they’re still around.



Because this place is so remote and so difficult to work in for much of the year, wildlife research is less developed than in the Arctic. Everybody knows about the polar bears; now, it’s time to think about the killer whales."

""The Senate should also reject efforts to amend the bill into a 'skinny repeal,' which is expected to accelerate health plans leaving the individual market, increase premiums, and result in fewer Americans having access to coverage,"" they said in a letter Wednesday to Senate leaders.

The Republican governors who signed the letter are:

Brian Sandoval of Nevada

of Nevada Charles Baker of Massachusetts

of Massachusetts John Kasich of Ohio

of Ohio Larry Hogan of Maryland

of Maryland Phil Scott of Vermont



The following Democratic governors also signed it:

John Hickenlooper of Colorado



of Colorado John Bel Edwards of Louisiana



of Louisiana Steve Bullock of Montana



of Montana Terry McAuliffe of Virginia



of Virginia Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania



They are urging Senate Republicans to set aside the House-passed health care bill under consideration in the upper chamber, which they call ""flawed,"" and they call for bipartisan negotiations and to work directly with governors. The governors' positions could be a major factor in how senators from their states would vote this week.

""True, lasting reforms can only be achieved in an open, bipartisan fashion,"" they said.

Congress should be working to stabilize the insurance market and make insurance more affordable, argued the governors, who said that the proposals pending in the Senate don't fulfill those goals.

""The bill still threatens coverage for millions of hardworking, middle class Americans. The bill's Medicaid provisions shift costs to states and fail to provide the necessary resources to ensure that no one is left out, including the working poor or those suffering from mental illness or addiction,"" they said.

Two major proposals to dismantle the 2010 health care law failed in the Senate Tuesday and Wednesday. One would have repealed and replace Obamacare, known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA) and the other would have delivered a partial repeal of Obamacare, delayed for two years to come up with a replacement.

Senate Republicans are now talking about a ""skinny repeal,"" which could repeal the individual and employer mandates as well as the medical device tax. They were still debating on Wednesday, however, what provisions could be wrapped in. They are aiming to include items that would qualify for a simple majority vote."

But buyers can often expect to get what they pay for. Homes at this price point cost almost 98 percent less than the national median home value, which is currently $200,400 according to Zillow. Before taking the leap on a $5,000 fixer-upper, it's critical to do your research and understand the risks.

These properties are typically sold as-is, and to make them livable, it's likely buyers will need to shell out some serious cash. You may discover that what you thought was a steal doesn't seem so great after factoring in the cost of a new foundation, roof, drywall, windows, flooring or other updates.

Find a good home inspector who can carefully examine the property from top to bottom, inside and out. Hire a real estate attorney who can confirm that the transaction is above-board.

Depending on your renovation budget, and the amount of time you're willing to invest, it's not impossible to find a hidden gem. In Cleveland, $5,000 can buy a 2,384-square-foot multifamily home. In Laguna Hills, California, it can buy a 500-square-foot condo with community pool access.

If you're looking to buy a property in this price range, whether as a full-time residence or investment, research the neighborhood and be on the lookout for red flags. Investigate local school performance, crime rates and home values. If you see too many potential problems, it might be better to look elsewhere.

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/alaska-cruise-ship-death-victim-kristy-manzanares/,cbsnews,Details emerge about woman killed on Alaska cruise,[],"ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- A Utah real estate agent killed on an Alaska cruise was remembered by her employer as a trusted adviser and valued sales associate.

Kristy Manzanares was found dead Tuesday night as the cruise ship Emerald Princess traveled between Ketchikan and Juneau.

Her husband, Kenneth Manzanares, was charged with murder after he was discovered with blood on his hands and clothes, and with blood spread throughout the cabin on the Princess Cruises ship, according to a criminal complaint by FBI Special Agent Michael L. Watson.

""Kristy was a dedicated and loving mother who juggled her business schedule to make her children the top priority,"" the statement from Summit Sotheby's International Realty in St. George, Utah, said.

Facebook via KUTV

Friends told CBS News' Jamie Yuccas that the couple were high school sweethearts and had been married more than 20 years.

Kristy Manzanares, 39, had a severe head wound, but authorities have declined to release other details in the case, including how many people were traveling with the couple on the 3,400-passenger Emerald Princess that left Sunday from Seattle.

A man and other people went into the room before medical workers and security officers had arrived and saw the woman on the floor covered in blood, according to court documents.

The man asked Manzanares what happened, and the suspect said, ""'She would not stop laughing at me,'"" according to the FBI complaint.

Manzanares then grabbed his wife's body and tried to drag her to the balcony, but the man stopped him, Watson wrote. The name of the man was not included in the complaint.

A ship security officer handcuffed Manzanares, who was held in a nearby cabin, authorities said.

While the FBI searched him, Manzanares said, ""'My life is over,'"" the complaint states.

Passenger Charles Rowlen and his wife were in a room two floors above Manzanares' cabin.

""I heard terrible screaming – I mean, you knew it wasn't normal,"" Rowlen told Yuccas.

Manzanares, 39, participated in his first court appearance Thursday by teleconference from Juneau, where he is in custody.

He appeared to be crying at times before the hearing and near the start, when U.S. Magistrate Judge Kevin F. McCoy began speaking.

Manzanares dabbed at his eyes and nose with tissues.

He was wearing an orange jumpsuit during the proceedings. He had his ankles shackled and was wearing slip-on shoes.

The maximum punishment Kenneth Manzanares faces if found guilty of federal murder charge is life in prison or the death penalty, according to CBS affiliate KTVA-TV.

McCoy appointed assistant Federal Defender Jamie McGrady to represent Manzanares. McGrady was not at the hearing and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Bail has not been set and a preliminary hearing was scheduled for Aug. 10. McCoy approved change of venue from Anchorage to Juneau for further proceedings.

Manzanares has no criminal history, according to online Utah court records.

The ship was diverted to Juneau because of the investigation, which the FBI is leading because the death occurred in U.S. waters."

Police Superintendent Michael Harrison said Officer Chris Abbott were working a private, off-duty neighborhood watch detail for the Hurstville Security and Neighborhood Improvement District when he was struck in the leg, CBS affiliate WWL-TV reports.

Police Chief Michael Harrison said the bullet went through the car door and hit the officer in the leg. He was in good condition Monday afternoon and has since been released, according to the station.

New Orleans Police Department

The shooter was in a light-colored SUV and was still at large. The vehicle was described as having its rear windshield either missing or shattered, WWL-TV adds.

Spokesman Aaron Looney confirmed that Abbott, a 25-year veteran of the department, had been shot previously in two separate incidents.

Archived news accounts show Abbott was on his way to a 2001 court appearance when he spotted a man with a gun and approached him. The man fired and hit Abbott.

In 1998, Abbott was wearing a protective vest when he was shot in the chest after stopping a suspect in a public housing project.

An investigation into Monday's shooting was underway. Early indications were that Abbott did not return fire in Monday's incident, Harrison said. However, he emphasized that the investigation was continuing.

""There are more questions we have to ask, information we need to get,"" Harrison said. ""We have protocols we are going to follow to ascertain and confirm all the answers to those questions.""

Abbott was one of the city's first community policing officers, a group of cops credited with helping to drastically reduce crime in the city's housing developments, WWL-TV writes.

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/climate-diaries-scientists-on-the-front-lines-in-antarctica/,cbsnews,Climate Diaries: Scientists on the front lines in Antarctica,[],"Correspondent Mark Phillips has traveled through Europe and Africa to document how climate change is impacting our world for his “Climate Diaries” series. This morning, traveling aboard the Lindblad Expeditions National Geographic Explorer, he reports from the far-less-traveled continent of Antarctica, where a massive iceberg is poised to break away, at a time of uncertainty over the U.S. government’s policy toward climate change:

It’s high summer down in Cierva Cove, Antarctica, and the temperature has been soaring all the way up to the freezing point. But when it comes to doing climate research, this is one of the hottest places on the planet.

Summer in Antarctica is an explosion of life in a place often thought of as a bleak, frozen wasteland.

And it’s an explosion of scientific research, because this is the time of year when Antarctica is accessible and can be studied. This is when it reveals the secrets that have been locked into its ice.

CBS News

Ken Taylor, one of America’s foremost ice scientists, has been studying the huge crack that’s opened up in one of the floating ice shelves that cling to the coast of Antarctica. “There’s a large berg about to break off of the Larsen ice shelf,” he said.

A berg the size of Delaware.

“Yes, it’s very large, and the fracture that is breaking off is expanding quite a bit lately, it jumps about a mile every week or so.”

It’s not so much the floating sea ice from the shelf that is worrying; it’s that without the ice shelf to hold it back, the glacial ice on land will flow into the ocean more quickly and drive sea levels up even more than the three feet that is already predicted for this century.

“There are several spots around here, around Antarctica, that are believed to be in this irreversible situation, where the ice on the ground is going to flow into the sea, and there’s nothing we can do to stop it at this point,” Taylor said.

Eric Guth is trying to get at science in another way. Because there are concerns about ice shelf stability, there are concerns about warming sea temperatures around the Antarctic peninsula.

What Guth is producing is an overview … literally. He is part of the Extreme Ice Survey that is documenting the changes that are happening, in pictures. Cameras placed at strategic locations snap one shot an hour, year-round.

CBS News

And they produce time-lapse images showing how the glaciers are moving, looking to see if they’re speeding up or getting thinner.

“This type of visual evidence, I think, is what people need,” Guth said. “Much of the general public are visual learners, as am I, and I think being able to see that with your own eyes is a very compelling way of communicating information.”

Why is all this happening? Again, the ice tells the story, and it is not in denial.

Ken Taylor normally drills miles deep into the Antarctic icecap to find the answers. Sometimes, though, you can find them floating all around you.

Trapped in the ice are bubbles of the air that was around tens of thousands of years ago when it was frozen -- air that had a fraction of the amount of the greenhouse gases in it compared to what the human race is pumping into the atmosphere now.

“It’s trapped in the ice, and if you release it, you can tell what the atmosphere was like 20-, 50-, 100,000 ago?” Phillips asked.

“If you break this open and smell that air, you’re smelling ancient air. It’s really good air! It’s like air before humans messed up the atmosphere, yeah,” Taylor replied.

There’s another kind of chill down here as well -- a chill in the scientific community who’s working here. A fear the research money they need for their work will be less forthcoming in the future, and a less sympathetic ear in government for the kind of science they do."
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/kristen-bell-on-why-her-daughters-dont-watch-frozen-holiday-plans/,cbsnews,"Kristen Bell on why her daughters don't watch ""Frozen,"" holiday plans",['Andrea Park'],"Kristen Bell has lent her voice to more than just “Frozen” character Anna; the actress is also known for speaking out about issues that include parenting and equal pay for women. Now, the actress is also bringing her wit and humor to commercials for Enterprise. She talked to CBS News about why her daughters don’t watch “Frozen,” her holiday plans and how she feels about the president-elect.

Tell me what was fun about making these commercials for Enterprise.

It was very collaborative. They were interested in how I interpreted the script. I got to add my own dialogue -- goofy things I would actually say or would find myself doing should I have the ability to run around like a child at any of the Enterprise locations and play with the vehicles.

Do you like driving?

I do. My husband actually races professionally often so it’s his turf but yes, I do.

What are your holiday plans?

We are staying home. We did a fair amount of traveling this year and we’re just hunkering down, watching Christmas movies and celebrating Christmas here with our family at our house in L.A.

Is “Frozen” a staple in your house?

No. They don’t actually watch “Frozen,” believe it or not! I put it on for them and it was a little too scary. They like the characters but they don’t really watch the movie. We do a lot of PBS Kids. Their attention span is not two hours as of yet, so we do the 11-minute TV show programs when they watch TV.

Do they understand that that’s you as Anna, though?

They do because we talk about it with them -- what we do for a living -- and they know there’s a real person behind the voices of the cartoons they watch and my daughter was watching a cartoon and said, “They’re not real, but there is a person behind them doing a voice.” And I was like, “Yeah, oh my gosh, you get this.”

She sounds really smart.

She knows Idina is Elsa. She knows Josh is Olaf. She’s able to associate humans with characters, which I think is rare for a three-year-old.

What can you tell us about “Frozen 2”?

I wish I knew. We haven’t seen anything yet. I thought we’d be recording by now but they’re still working on the script. But we did an Olaf special that comes out next Christmas and the music has been written for it.

There’s been a lot of talk about how “Frozen” really diverges from traditional princess stories and embraces strong women. How does it feel to be part of a project like that?

I feel proud. I don’t love stories that have just a bad guy and you never explore what made them bad or sad and “Frozen” did a great job with that. We talk with the kids about why the bad guy is sad and what made him sad and grumpy. I was really proud “Frozen” didn’t really have a villain, or at least not in Elsa. She was a very complex, misunderstood character. I was really proud of representing that story.

You represent lots of viewpoints on social media or in your art. You’ve talked about mental health, the Syrian refugee crisis, equal pay -- what’s been the best part of having the platform you have?

Just knowing I can be a voice for people who feel voiceless. There are important issues that many of us don’t see on a day-to-day basis in the comfort of our lives and I am definitely included in that. I don’t run into refugees here in L.A. but I stay abreast of what’s happening because people are important to me.

You were pretty vocal against Donald Trump during election season. Now that he’s our president-elect, how do you feel about moving forward?

I think it’s important to unify our country again. I think the most important thing is to listen, to hear other people and hear where they’re coming from. I think understanding people is the only thing that works.

Speaking of equal pay, was there a time in your career when you felt particularly discriminated against for being a woman?

In “Forgetting Sarah Marshall,”Jason Segel was the only one nude in the movie. I thought it was about time someone turned the tables and we had a little male nudity to balance all the female nudity in Hollywood. I thought that was an inspired choice."
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/north-korea-missile-launch-detected-pentagon/,cbsnews,"North Korea launched another ICBM, Pentagon says",[],"PYONGYANG, North Korea -- North Korea on Friday test-fired its second intercontinental ballistic missile, which flew longer and higher than the first according to its wary neighbors, leading analysts to conclude that a wide swath of the U.S. including Los Angeles and Chicago is now within range of Pyongyang's weapons.

Japanese government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said the missile, launched late Friday night, flew for about 45 minutes - about five minutes longer than the ICBM North Korea test-fired on July 4.

""We assess that this missile was an intercontinental ballistic missile, as had been expected,"" Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Jeff Davis said in Washington.

In response, the U.S. and South Korea conducted a test of a missile launch system, the Pentagon confirmed to CBS News. A similar test was done in response to the July 4 launch.

Friday's missile was launched on a very high trajectory, which limited the distance it traveled, and landed west of Japan's island of Hokkaido.

Analysts had estimated that the missile tested July 4 could have reached Alaska, and said Friday that the latest missile appeared to extend that range significantly.

David Wright, a physicist and co-director of the global security program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in Washington that if reports of the missile's maximum altitude and flight time are correct, it would have a theoretical range of at least 10,400 kilometers (about 6,500 miles). That means it could have reached Los Angeles, Denver and Chicago, depending on variables such as the size and weight of the warhead that would be carried atop such a missile in an actual attack.

Bruce Klingner, a Korean and Japanese affairs specialist at the Heritage Foundation think tank in Washington, said, ""It now appears that a significant portion of the continental United States is within range"" of North Korean missiles. Klingner recently met with North Korean officials to discuss denuclearization, the think tank said.

Washington and its allies have watched with growing concern as Pyongyang has made significant progress toward its goal of having all of the U.S. within range of its missiles to counter what it labels as U.S. aggression. The progress it has made toward producing nuclear warheads to fit on those missiles is less clear.

President Trump has said he will not allow North Korea to obtain an ICBM that can deliver a nuclear warhead.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the launch a ""serious and real threat"" to the country's security.

Suga, the Japanese spokesman, said Japan has lodged a strong protest with North Korea.

""North Korea's repeated provocative acts absolutely cannot be accepted,"" he said.

A spokesman for Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Friday that Dunford met at the Pentagon with the commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific, Adm. Harry Harris, to discuss U.S. military options in light of North Korea's missile test.

The spokesman, Navy Capt. Greg Hicks, said Dunford and Harris placed a phone call to Dunford's South Korean counterpart, Gen. Lee Sun Jin. Dunford and Harris ""expressed the ironclad commitment to the U.S.-Republic of Korea alliance,"" Hicks said, referring to the U.S. defense treaty that obliges the U.S. to defend South Korea.

Prime Minister Abe said Japan would cooperate closely with the U.S., South Korea and other nations to step up pressure on North Korea to halt its missile programs. Repeated rounds of sanctions from the U.N. Security Council, however, have yet to deter the North.

U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley said this week that China was cooperating on a new U.N. resolution that would impose additional sanctions against North Korea, CBS News foreign affairs analyst Pamela Falk reports.

""We are constantly in touch with China, and I can say that things are moving, but it is still too early to tell how far they'll move,"" Haley said.

South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missile reached an estimated height of 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles) before landing at sea about 1,000 kilometers (625 miles) away. It appeared to be more advanced than the ICBM North Korea previously launched, it said.

The ""Hwasong 14"" ICBM test-fired earlier this month was also launched at a very steep angle, a technique called lofting, and reached a height of more than 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) before splashing down in the ocean 930 kilometers (580 miles) away. Analysts said that missile could be capable of reaching most of Alaska or possibly Hawaii if fired in an attacking trajectory.

South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missile was launched from North Korea's northern Jagang province near the border with China. President Moon Jae-in presided over an emergency meeting of the National Security Council, which called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council and stronger sanctions on North Korea.

There was no immediate confirmation of the launch by North Korea. The day's broadcast on state-run television had already ended when the news broke at around midnight Pyongyang time.

July 27 is a major national holiday in North Korea called Victory in the Fatherland Liberation War Day, marking the day when the armistice was signed ending the 1950-53 Korean War. That armistice is yet to be replaced with a peace treaty, leaving the Korean Peninsula technically in a state of war.

North Korea generally waits hours or sometimes a day or more before announcing launches, often with a raft of photos in the ruling party newspaper or on the television news. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is usually shown at the site to observe and supervise major launches.

Late night launches are rare. North Korea usually conducts its missile and underground nuclear tests in the morning. It's likely the North launched the missile at night and from the remote province of Jagang to demonstrate its operational versatility. To have a real deterrent, it's important for North Korea to prove it can launch whenever and wherever it chooses, making it harder for foreign military observers trying to detect their activities ahead of time."
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-spot-signs-of-a-child-drowning/,cbsnews,How to spot lesser-known signs a child is drowning,['Ashley Welch'],"With summer recreation luring kids to the water, experts caution parents that one of the season's favorite pastimes is also one of the most dangerous for children.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, drowning is the second-leading cause of accidental deaths in kids under the age of 15.

What's more, nearly half of child drownings happen within 25 yards of an adult, and 10 percent of adults will witness the situation without even realizing the drowning is happening.

That's because often times what most of us think of as the telltale signs of drowning – flailing arms and shouting for help – simply don't happen, says Mario Vittone, a former U.S. Coast Guard officer, water safety expert and author of a recent article for Slate called ""Drowning Doesn't Look Like Drowning.""

He says there are two phases of drowning, the first being aquatic distress when people know they are in trouble and can wave or call for help. Then comes the instinctive drowning response.

""That's when you're no longer capable to maintain your own airway and a lot of times the head will be back, the eyes will be glassed over and people will be looking toward safety or looking toward shore,"" Vittone told CBS News. ""[They will be] vertical in the water, very little or no supporting kick, mostly just arm movement and sort of a lateral splashing down of the water.""

A drowning person's head may bob up and below the surface of the water repeatedly or it can happen entirely under water.

This instinctive drowning response lasts 30 to 60 seconds at the most, Vittone said, so it's imperative the person gets help immediately.

When it comes to supervision, especially for children, he said a lifeguard may not be enough.

""Lifeguards have to focus and if you've ever tried to focus for a solid 15 minutes, it's really tough to do,"" he said.

If your child is not an extremely strong swimmer, Vittone recommends what's called ""touch supervision.""

""I'm close enough to them to reach them. You really can't be sitting on the side of the pool with your non-swimming child and just be watching them. You certainly can't have your cellphone out. You have to be paying attention to them and I like to tell parents to be close.""

Teaching kids they should never go in the water without an adult is also an important part of overall water safety.

""For every child that drowns, five are seriously injured. So just because you save them from drowning doesn't mean you're out of trouble,"" Vittone said. ""Those aquatic injuries can be very serious.""

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission recommends all kids learn how to swim from certified swimming instructors. Adults should also teach children to stay away from pool drains and filters.

Older kids and teens — even those who are proficient swimmers — should swim with a buddy.

At pool parties or other group activities involving water, experts recommend having an adult designated ""water watcher"" at all times.

""There's always one parent who's always watching the water, who's not talking to anybody not socializing at the party doing nothing but watching the kids,"" Vittone said."

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-economy-grew-by-2-6-percent-short-of-trumps-goals/,cbsnews,"U.S. economy grew by 2.6 percent, short of Trump's goals",[],"The U.S. economy revved up this spring after a weak start to the year, fueled by strong consumer spending. But the growth spurt still fell short of the optimistic goals President Donald Trump hopes to achieve through tax cuts and regulatory relief.

The Commerce Department says growth in the gross domestic product, the economy's total output of goods and services, expanded at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter. That's more than double the revised 1.2 percent pace in the first quarter.

Even though the number fell short of Mr. Trump's goal for sustained growth of 4 percent, it does represent an improvement fueled by a robust recovery in consumer spending after a slowdown during the winter. Many economists are skeptical of the Trump administration's goals for economic growth given headwinds such as the country's aging workforce and slowing productivity.

While Trump campaigned on a pledge to boost growth to rates of 4 percent or better, his economic program has not advanced in Congress.

The 2.6 percent GDP gain came in close to economists' expectations.

""Consumers continue to drive the economy's growth, but firmer business investment is also a plus,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ""Weaker housing construction was the only significant drag on growth in the quarter.""

GDP growth should come in at about 2.5 percent to 3 percent for the remainder of 2017, putting the Federal Reserve on track to boost rates later this year, according to Andrew Hunter, chief economist at Capital Economics.

""Looking ahead, the strengthening labor market should continue to support real consumption growth, while the business surveys remain at a high level and suggest that investment will continue to recover,"" he wrote in a Friday morning research note. Those trends ""should leave the Fed on track to raise interest rates once more before year-end.""

Trump in May put forward a budget for next year that projects growth to steadily advance in the coming years, hitting a sustained pace of 3 percent annually by 2021. The Congressional Budget Office and most private economists are less optimistic, believing growth rates have the potential of improving only slightly from the lackluster rates seen in the current recovery, the weakest in the post-World War II period.

Also on Friday, the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis issued an annual benchmark revision of its data going back three years. The revision slightly boosted growth over the past three years, enough to lift the average growth in this recovery, now the third longest in U.S. history, to annual gains of 2.2 percent, up from the previous estimate of 2.1 percent.

The 2.6 percent growth in the second quarter was the fastest pace since the economy expanded at a 2.8 percent rate in the third quarter of last year.

Much of the strength in the April-June period came from consumer spending, which grew at a 2.8 percent rate, up from a 1.9 percent growth rate in the first quarter. Consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of economic activity. The economy also benefited far more modest inventory reductions, which was a big drag on first quarter growth.

In the other major categories, business investment in plant and equipment grew at a 5.2 percent rate. But housing construction tumbled at a 6.8 percent rate, a payback after an 11.1 percent surge in the winter due to warmer-than-normal weather. Economists believe housing will resume growing in coming quarters.

A shrinking trade deficit added a modest 0.2 percentage point to growth as exports rose while imports, which subtract from the GDP, grew at a slower pace.

The government sector grew at a 0.7 percent rate, driven entirely by a big jump in defense spending. Domestic federal programs and state and local governments all showed small declines.

Weakness in the first quarter that is followed by a stronger spring expansion has become a familiar pattern in recent years, prompting the government to launch a concerted effort to deal with flaws in the government's seasonal adjustment process.

Even with the spring rebound, analysts believe the economy will be unable to meet the ambitious targets set by Trump. For this year, many analysts believe growth will come in around 2.2 percent, essentially where growth has been since the recovery began in mid-2009.

During last year's presidential campaign, Trump attacked the Obama administration's economic record and said he could jump-start growth through a program of tax cuts for individuals and businesses, regulatory relief, tougher enforcement of trade laws to lower U.S. trade deficits and an increase in spending on infrastructure projects.

But given the fact that the program has failed to advance in Congress, many economists have trimmed their expectations for growth this year, saying any boost from Trump's efforts will not likely show up until 2018.

The GDP report released Friday was the first of three estimates the government will issue."

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-eating-to-win-became-big-business/,cbsnews,How eating to win became big business,['Irina Ivanova'],"As if the proliferation of summer cookouts, barbecues and extended family dinners weren't enough, the months of July and August are peak season for another kind of eating: the competitive kind.

This summer, a crowd will gather on Long Island, New York, to see who can eat eight pounds of Mexican food the fastest. The menu consists of three tacos, three empanadas, two-and-a half pounds of nachos, a giant burrito and, not to deprive those with a sweet tooth, three churros. Roughly a thousand miles away, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, an annual festival brought out residents to devour bushels of kolaches, a traditional Czech pastry. And in August, dozens will descend on Buffalo, New York, to scarf down pound upon pound of chopped kale.

Eating contests have moved beyond the county fair and become a multimillion-dollar industry, with thousand of events every year. The industry's flagship competition, the July 4th hot-dog eating contest in Coney Island, plays on ESPN.

But for the big-eaters out there intrigued by the idea of making a living doing what you love, be warned: You better have the stomach for it.

For one, it's a pricey hobby. Competition can be fierce, typically for cash prizes that don't come close to replacing a full-time job. And it carries the very real possibility of choking to death, as well as potential long-term health effects that are still largely unknown.

Eat your heart out

Despite such challenges, the appeal of competitive eating seems to be growing. More than 4,000 eating contests of one kind of another are set to take place across the U.S. this year, according to Eat Feats, a website that tracks eating competitions. That's a fivefold increase over the last 10 years. A handful of these, such as Coney Island's hot dog eating contest and Philadelphia's Wings Bowl, have become famous, but the bulk of events are hyperlocal -- and therein lies their appeal.

""There's very little at risk,"" said John Stanton, a professor of food marketing at Saint Joseph's University. ""No one can just say, 'I'm going to be an Olympic skier, I'm going to be a professional soccer player.' Virtually anyone can enter an eating contest.""

Many contests grow out of local or regional specialties, but just as often they're dreamed up by brands looking to generate a little extra marketing. Because of the events' appeal to the desirable young male demographic, food makers are often willing to put up some prize money for what they hope will be an outsize return.

More food than funds

The proliferation of gorge-fests will draw thousands of contestants, but the number of eaters who can make a living chowing down can be counted on one hand.

""Just a handful of competitive eaters can subsist on competitive eating,"" said Richard Shea, co-founder of Major League Eating, which sponsors 50 to 80 major eating competitions each year. ""The balance of our league is people who can supplement their income.""

The largest event staged by MLE, which ranks the top 50 competitive eaters in the U.S., is the Nathan's Famous hot-dog eating contest, which takes place in Coney Island every July 4. It's ""the Super Bowl of eating contests,"" Shea said. Just as with the football event, people hoping to compete have to prove themselves on a smaller stage, placing in one of about two dozen regional qualifying events.

""Some competitors have an inherent ability, and others, it takes them a while to go to a bunch of contests and figure out how to work it,"" he said.

The top prize at a local competition can range from $2,000 to $5,000. But while entering is often free or just a few dollars, travel costs aren't covered, and they can quickly add up.

Maintenance costs are high

An aspiring contestant who works hard to prepare for the rigors of competition, scopes out local events, possibly entering a number of contests in an attempt to find his perfect food, can look forward to a life on the road -- at least on weekends.

Many local contests are held in small towns that can be a challenge to get to. That's the experience of Gideon Oji, a competitive eater who won a Buffalo kale-eating contest last year after consuming 25 bowls of the leafy greens.

""Sometimes it costs a lot of money,"" Oji said. ""I've literally driven 18 hours to Iowa for a contest. I've driven to Texas from Atlanta. I've tried to figure it out -- lot of these places don't have airports close by.""

For one of Oji's first contests, a friend drove him nine hours from his home in Atlanta to Florida. They were so broke they were relying on the contest to cover the trip back. Fortunately, his third-place finish won him several hundred dollars -- enough to cover the trip.

In between events, there's practice. Most serious competitive eaters stuff themselves semi-regularly to stretch out their stomach and get used to holding large quantities of food. (That's despite Major League Eating official disapproval of practicing.)

""If you want to be a better eater, you don't have a choice,"" said Ed Jarvis, a retired eater who lives on Long Island. ""The only way you get good at something is practicing.""

Jarvis holds eating records for, among other foods, chicken wings, dumplings, ice cream, French fries and grapes.

""Sometimes I would eat 12 to 15 pound of cabbage in one sitting to stretch my stomach. Sometimes I would drink several gallons of water,"" he said.

Once you start practicing with a target food, it can quickly get pricey. The current men's record for eating hot dogs is 73 hot dogs in a sitting; eating that much in a practice run can easily put you out $50 or $60.

Preparing for wing-eating competitions, Jarvis would sometimes get his chomps in at buffets, which were his cheapest option. ""It would cost $30-40 if I were to buy the wings,"" he said.

Jarvis, who works in real estate, kept his job during his eating career -- a balancing act he concedes was a challenge. For eaters who have day jobs, which is most of them, juggling the time can be hard. It can also be a strain on relationships, as Tim Janus, another retired eater, revealed on a recent podcast. (""It's much better to be a retired competitive eater when you're dating,"" he said.)

It's oversubscribed

The field has gotten much more competitive since the early day of MLE. When George and Richard Shea started representing Nathan's in the 1990s, Richard recalls, he had to recruit contestants. He remembers holding qualifying events in shopping malls, where only three or four people would register to compete. He would walk around, looking for ""large, grown men"" to fill out the roster.

""Now, when we announce any contest, we're typically oversubscribed. More often than not, we have a waiting list,"" he said.

For the handful of eaters who manage to win consistently, there can be money beyond the ""purse"" -- the prize that's awarded to the top three winners. Joey Chestnut, who has won the Nathan's competition 10 times, with a record 73 hot dogs, reportedly earns $200,000 a year, largely from sponsorships. But the dropoff from first place to second is steep.

""We all wanted more sponsorship,"" Jarvis recalled. ""In some sports you get a tremendous amount of sponsorship and in some you don't. That's just how it is.""

Shea compares competitive eating to bass fishing, a sport where most participants do it as a hobby and only a handful have sponsorships.

And even if one does make it to the top, the reign -- as in many sports -- can be brief. The first competitive eater to become a household name, Takeru Kobayashi, was forced to leave the field eight years ago over a contract dispute with MLE. (He still competes in non-MLE events.)

But for some, dreams of glory aren't so easily abandoned. For Oji, currently ranked sixth in the world, the goal is to unseat Chestnut as the world's biggest eater. He said he wants to use his public platform to draw attention to pressing issues. The cause dear to his heart? Global hunger."
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/gluten-free-diet-without-a-medical-reason-heart-health/,cbsnews,What a gluten-free diet may mean for your heart,['Kathleen Doheny'],"Eating ""gluten-free"" when there's no medical need to do so won't boost your heart health -- and might even harm it, a new study warns.

Gluten-free diets have soared in popularity in recent years. But, shunning gluten has no heart benefits for people without celiac disease, and it may mean consuming a diet lacking heart-healthy whole grains, according to the quarter-century study.

""For the vast majority of people who can tolerate it, restricting gluten to improve your overall health is likely not to be a beneficial strategy,"" said study leader Dr. Andrew Chan.

Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye and barley. People with celiac disease -- less than 1 percent of the U.S. population -- have an immune system reaction when they eat gluten, triggering inflammation and intestinal damage. They also have an increased risk of heart disease, but that declines after they begin eating a gluten-free diet, according to background information in the study.

Recently, researchers have reported that some people may have what's known as non-celiac gluten sensitivity, a condition that's not totally understood.

""I don't want to dismiss the fact that there are people who have the sensitivity,"" said Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.

But, the rest of the population should not think that going gluten-free will help their health -- at least not their heart health, he said.

For the study, Chan and his colleagues analyzed data on nearly 65,000 women and more than 45,000 men, all U.S. health professionals without a history of heart disease when the study started. The study participants completed a detailed food questionnaire beginning in 1986 and updated it every four years until 2010.

The researchers looked at gluten intake, dividing participants into five groups from low to high, then calculated how likely they were to develop heart disease over roughly 26 years.

When the researchers compared the highest-intake gluten group with the lowest, the rates of heart disease were not very different.

However, people with restricted gluten intake often eat a diet low in fiber-rich whole grains -- which are tied to lower heart risk -- and higher in refined grains, Chan said.

So, the researchers then adjusted their findings for intake of refined grains. ""It appeared that those individuals who consumed the lowest levels of dietary gluten had a 15 percent higher risk of heart disease,"" Chan said.

Because the study was observational, however, ""we can't say with certainty that this is a cause-and-effect association,"" Chan said.

Dr. Ravi Dave is a cardiologist and professor of medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles Geffen School of Medicine.

""Eating gluten-free is a big fad right now,"" said Dave, who wasn't involved in the study. ""There is a lot of hype about how gluten produces inflammation and can lead to giving you diabetes, heart disease, dementia, a lot of things.""

Although he finds this new study inconclusive, Dave agreed with the researchers: ""We should not recommend people who don't have gluten sensitivity or celiac disease go on a gluten-free diet,"" he said.

Dave also said the study left some questions unanswered. For instance, it doesn't reveal what the people who avoided gluten substituted. ""Were they picking a more unhealthy choice that put them at risk for heart disease?"" he wondered.

For people who still want or need to steer clear of gluten, Chan said it's important to obtain adequate amounts of fiber. Oats and brown rice are good sources of gluten-free fiber, he noted.

The study had no food industry funding. It was published online May 2 in BMJ."

But when Cohen isn't delivering witty one-liners on TV, he's working with Purina to help educate children on rescue dogs.

Cohen talked to CBS News about his work with Purina ONE, his relationship with President Trump and his secret to getting along with the Housewives.

Tell me about your and your dog's partnership with Purina ONE.

""I have a rescue named Wacha, had him for three, three-and-a-half years and so this is a great partnership with Purina because they have a great plan going with the Muttigrees Program, where they bring rescue dogs into classrooms and they teach the kids about being with animals and (about the animals themselves and dogs that need rescuing.

""I've been in a couple of classrooms and brought Wacha in to read a story with some kids. It's a really cool program and I've put the dog on Purina's 28-Day Challenge, which is easy to sign up for, and basically everyone who signs up, Purina will give $10 to the Muttigree program.""

Do you feel at home reading to kids?

""Oh yeah, totally. That was really fun, talking to them. They all want to learn about dogs, they want to pet the dog and talked about reading their signals and looking at pet behavior. There are over 3 million dogs that need to be rescued and these are potential future pet owners that we're talking to.""

Do you have any interest in having your own kids?

""In kids? Yeah, I do. I'm kind of an old guy, but you never know.""

Would you say you're close friends with some of the Housewives? You've known them for a long time now.

""I would say we all have a great working relationship that overlaps into friendships. This has now been since 2006, is when 'Orange County' premiered and so yeah, this has been going on a long time and we've seen a lot together, experienced a lot together and kind of come up together.""

Sometimes during the reunion shows you really press the Housewives for answers and kind of tease them, but they all seem to like you, still. You have a lot of volatile people on there -- what's your secret to getting along with them?

""Well, first of all, I'm their boss. Even if they hate me, they have to pretend they like me and they know what to expect with me. They know what they signed up for. It's not a surprise. Ultimately, I'm rooting for all of them to succeed because if they succeed, the show succeeds and I succeed, so we all want it to work.""

After all these years and different cities of ""Housewives,"" what are the most surprising lessons you've learned?

""I think that one of the big lessons is, don't come on a reality show if you have something to hide, because it will catch up to you. The cameras catch everything, so be careful.""

You've said before that President Trump and Kellyanne Conway are like characters on ""Real Housewives."" Have you met him before?

""Yeah, I've met Trump many times. I hosted beauty pageants for him, interviewed him. People in the country are kind of surprised by the ferocity of New Yorkers' opinions about Donald Trump and it's because he's really been around the city. There are so many New Yorkers with some connection to Donald Trump.""

Did you like him before his presidency?

""Um, uh, really good question. Eh, not particularly.""

Did anyone call you, upset about your book ""Superficial""?

""No, I've done pretty well. I think maybe people have tried to extricate themselves from me and I don't realize it, but I've done OK so far. I've kind of stayed away from some people that I'm nervous about.""

Do you have any other projects in the pipeline?

""I'm hosting 'Love Connection' on Fox this summer every Thursday night at 9. It's a great reboot of the classic game show and from the producers of 'The Bachelor' and 'American Idol.' I'm very excited about that and 'Andy Cohen: Then and Now' is coming back to Bravo on May 2 and it's a fun look back at pop culture and how things in the past affect where we are today. There's a lot of cool stuff about Trump and who he was then and how that's played into now."""
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/june-foray-voice-of-rocky-the-flying-squirrel-dead-at-99/,cbsnews,"June Foray, voice of Rocky the Flying Squirrel, dead at 99",[],"Actress June Foray, who gave voice to Rocky the Flying Squirrel and hundreds of other cartoon characters and was sometimes known as the ""female Mel Blanc,"" has died in a Los Angeles hospital. She was 99.

Foray died Wednesday at West Hills Hospital in Los Angeles of cardiac arrest, but she had been in fragile health since a car accident two years ago, niece Robin Thaler said Thursday.

Foray was the best-known woman among the voice performers who contributed so much to the classic cartoons of Warner Bros., Disney, Hanna-Barbera and other studios. She had a galaxy of ways to create funny but believable characters, but could also be warm and wise in Disney's ""Mulan"" or, in a memorable ""Twilight Zone"" episode, chilling.

She had over 300 credits as a voice actress, most recently doing one last turn as Rocky in a 2014 short.

Born in Springfield, Massachusetts, Foray was a teenager when she moved with her parents to Los Angeles. She had begun performing in radio as a child in Massachusetts and, once in Hollywood, became active in major radio programs such as ""The Jimmy Durante Show."" She later called old-time radio a great training ground, forcing her to learn to be versatile and quick-thinking.

AP

Among the legends she worked with were Chuck Jones and the other famed Warner's animators; Jay Ward, creator of ""Rocky and Bullwinkle""; Rod Serling, creator of ""The Twilight Zone""; radio and recording satirist Stan Freberg; and such cartoon voice talents as Daws Butler (Huckleberry Hound) and Blanc (Bugs Bunny, Sylvester).

In his 1989 memoir, ""Chuck Amuck,"" Jones noted ""the highly talented and versatile Mel Blanc"" did voices for Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Tweety, Yosemite Sam and others, ""except female voices, which were done by the equally talented June Foray.""

Perhaps inevitably, Rocky -- with his trademark exclamation ""Hokey Smoke!"" -- was Foray's favorite.

""Everybody asks me that,"" she said in a 2000 Associated Press interview. ""I think the fans kind of answer that for me. Everybody loves Rocky. I get letters from Belgium, Germany, all over. People don't think of him as a squirrel. They think of him as a person. And he's a good little person.""

The diminutive Foray wore a gold Rocky pendant around her neck that she delighted in pointing out to people.

She was also fond of Rocky's pal, voiced by Bill Scott, as well. ""Bullwinkle was a very sweet creature,"" Foray said. ""He was not a stupid person. He was extremely ingenious. He was very faithful.""

The original ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" aired in 326 short installments as part of a series featuring other cartoon creations by Ward. The Cold War conflict pitted the moose and squirrel against the bumbling spies Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale, to whom Foray also gave a voice.

""Rocky and His Friends"" ran on ABC weekday afternoons from 1959 through 1961, and then ""The Bullwinkle Show"" was on NBC from 1961 to 1964, first in prime-time and later in daytime.

Besides Bullwinkle J. Moose and Rocket J. Squirrel, the show featured such sequences as ""Fractured Fairy Tales""; ""Peabody's Improbable History""; ""Aesop and Son""; and ""Adventures of Dudley Do- Right.""

""The shows were on two plateaus,"" Foray once said. ""The children enjoyed it because of the humorous look of the characters and the sounds of the voices. The adults find it so inventive because of the puns, the satire. ... It was a show that was different from everything that came before it or after it.""

In 1966, Foray was the voice of Cindy Lou Who in the much-revived TV holiday special ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"" based on the Dr. Seuss book, directed by Jones and narrated by Boris Karloff. She worked with Jones on another classic children's story in 1973, voicing the mother in ""The Cricket in Times Square.""

Earlier, she worked with Freberg on his 1953 hit record, ""St. George and the Dragonet,"" a parody of the ""Dragnet"" series, and teamed with Freberg again for his acclaimed historical comedy records ""Stan Freberg Presents The United States of America. Vol. 1"" in 1961 and ""Vol. 2"" in 1996, portraying a host of historical characters. She also contributed her voice talents to one of the best-known ""Twilight Zone"" episodes, a 1963 chiller about a talking doll that turns murderous.

""I'm Talky Tina ... and I'm going to kill you,"" the doll says to the hapless victim (played by Telly Savalas, later famous as ""Kojak."")

For Walt Disney, her contributions included the voice of Lucifer the cat on his 1950 ""Cinderella."" At Warner Bros., she was the voice of Witch Hazel in several Jones films and Granny, the owner of Tweety Bird and Sylvester, in many cartoons, though Bea Benadaret (the voice of Betty Rubble on ""The Flintstones"") also voiced Granny in some early cartoons. For Walter Lantz she was Woody Woodpecker's nephew and niece, Knothead and Splinter.

Later generations might know her voice best as Grandmother Fa in Disney's ""Mulan"" from 1998.

As cartoon characters were recycled by Hollywood, Foray remained active into her 80s. She did Granny on ""Tiny Toon Adventures"" and reprised her Rocky role in the 2000 big-screen adaptation, ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,"" a mixture of cartoon and live action starring Rene Russo and Jason Alexander. The film was poorly received, but she thought it had a good story line and ""all the charm of Rocky and Bullwinkle."""

Linkin Park has performed frequently with Limp Bizkit since the early 2000s, and Durst shared his memories of Bennington with Variety.

Durst talked about being there when Linkin Park played their first show in Europe.

""They came in our dressing rooms and they were clearly both so excited and so shy,"" Durst told Variety.

Linkin Park was playing before Limp Bizkit that night.

""I remember seeing them on the side of the stage and as we're performing, I was thinking to myself, 'Chester's voice is going to blow these kids the f— up,'"" Durst said. ""It was a great moment and I'm happy now to have had it.""

Durst also said that Bennington was thoughtful and never wanted to unload his misery onto other people.

""Often those types of people have so much pain and torture inside that the last thing they want is to contaminate or break the spirit of others,"" he said. ""He would go out of his way to make sure you knew he truly cares.""

Durst said that he and Bennington gave each other credit for artistic growth; he said in his last conversation with Bennington, the Linkin Park singer thanked Durst for paving the way for bands like his.

""In return, I told him if it weren't for him and his voice and his words, this genre would never have reached the masses and affected so many lives,"" said Durst. ""I thanked him for being so courageous and humble and for always being such a gentleman. We laughed and hugged and told jokes as if there would always be a tomorrow for us to meet again.""

Durst said he wishes he could hug Bennington and talk about his pain with him, but, he said, ""I won't get that hug and that moment now, which makes me so sad.""

Bennington's death was ruled as a suicide by hanging after an autopsy was conducted on Friday. No drugs were evident in Bennington's room at his home in Palos Verdes Estate, California."

He strayed from the topic of illegal immigration and eradicating MS-13 gang violence to say briefly that Congress should have approved the health care repeal, ""But you can't have everything."" But he promised the crowd, ""We're going to get it done. We're going to get it done."" And he repeated the sentiment, ""Let Obamacare implode.""

The president vowed to destroy the ""vile"" cartel MS-13, which he called ""particularly violent."" He said that these gang members don't like shooting people because ""it's too quick and too fast.""

""I was reading, one of these animals was caught, and explaining, they like to knife 'em and cut 'em and let them die slowly because that way it's more painful. And they enjoy watching that much more,"" the president said. ""These are animals."" And he also pointed out that the gang was responsible for 17 murders in Suffolk County since January.

Mr. Trump also had some questionable arrest advice for police officers.

""When you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see them thrown in - rough - I said, 'Please don't be too nice.' Like when you guys put someone in the car and you're protecting their head [with your hand],..like don't hit their head, and they've just killed somebody....I said, 'you can take the hand away.'""

Mr. Trump promised again that the wall on the southern border would be built, and said $1.6 billion was approved for the start of construction of the wall. This is half-true -- the House passed a bill with this funding this week, but the Senate has not yet approved the funding.

""We'll build a good wall,"" he said, adding ""We're going to build a real wall,"" a wall ""that works."" It would be an additional tool to stop the inflow of drugs into our country, the president explained.

Mr. Trump's speech Friday afternoon took place at Suffolk County Community College in Brentwood, New York, close to where the ultra-violent street gang MS-13 committed a string of gruesome murders, including the massacre of four young men in April in a Central Islip park. He spoke against a backdrop of uniformed police officers and addressed law enforcement officers and family members of crime victims.

The Trump administration Justice and Homeland Security Departments have made targeting the gang a top priority. Mr. Trump's embattled attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has directed federal prosecutors to prioritize the prosecution of these gang members. The administration blames the resurgence of MS-13 in some areas on illegal immigration, and it believes that cracking down on so-called ""sanctuary cities"" and building a wall on the southern border will eradicate the problem.

Shortly before he left the White House for Long Island Friday, the president tweeted, ""We will always ENFORCE our laws, PROTECT our borders, and SUPPORT our police!""

Live updates below:





Trump: We're going to destroy the vile criminal cartel MS-13

""As you know, I am the big big believer in people in law enforcement, from day one,"" Mr. Trump said, explaining why he had come to Long Island. Uniformed police officers are standing behind the president as he speaks.

""We love our police, we love our sheriffs, and we love our ICE officers,"" and they've been working hard, he said.

Of the gang MS-13, the president said, ""We're going to destroy the vile criminal cartel MS-13,"" among others. MS-13 members, he said, are ""animals,"" who ""don't like shooting people because it's too quick.""

State police from New York and New Jersey, immigration officers, and other federal agency workers were in the audience, Mr. Trump said. He also welcomed some of his political supporters to the speech, including Rep. Chris Collins, whom he praised for being an early supporter of his presidential candidacy. And he thanked Rep. Peter King, who introduced him.

Health care vote

Mr. Trump interrupted his MS-13 and immigration comments to say of the Senate that they ""should have approved health care last night."" But, he said, ""You can't have everything."" He promised, ""We're going to get it done. We're going to get it done."" And he repeated the sentiment, ""Let Obamacare implode.""

MS-13

Cities that have ""pathetic mayor[s]"" or a mayor who ""doesn't know what's going on"" are seeing less progress, Mr. Trump suggested. He recalled his own upbringing on Long Island, which he noted, did not see violence like that wrought by MS-13. Since Jan. 13, MS-13 members have killed 17 people in this area, Mr. Trump said. MS-13 members ""stomp on their victims"" and ""slash them with machetes.""

""They have transformed peaceful parks...into bloodstained killing fields"" he said. ""They're animals.""

We will find you, arrest you, jail you and deport you, Mr. Trump said, addressing MS-13 members directly.

The president called on Congress to provide funding for ""hundreds more immigration judges if we're going to dismantle these deadly networks,"" he told the crowd.

The Wall

Mr. Trump promised again that the wall on the southern border would be built, and said $1.6 billion was approved for the start of construction of the wall. This is half-true -- the House passed a bill with this funding, but the Senate has not yet passed the spending bill.

""We'll build a good wall,"" he said, adding ""We're going to build a real wall,"" a wall ""that works.""

It's an additional tool to stop the inflow of drugs into our country, the president said. The previous administration, he claimed, welcomed illegal immigrants into the country, allowing MS-13 to flourish. ""It got worse and worse,"" but he said, ""We turned that back.""

Scaramucci and Priebus

White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci and chief of staff Reince Priebus both traveled to New York with the president, a day after the New Yorker published a story in which Scaramucci says of Priebus, ""Reince is a f******* paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac,"" and made other vulgar comments about Priebus and Steve Bannon

The pool reporter on Air Force One asked Scaramucci about the New Yorker comments, but he declined to comment, saying only, ""Come on, that was not fair. You know that was not fair.""

Her car had run out of gas, she had $5 in her pocket and a long walk ahead of her in the pouring rain.

But it was that same day Hector met a man who would change her life — and she didn't know it at the time, but she would end up changing his as well.

Chris Wright was driving with his family to church when he spotted the woman walking along the side of the road. He kept driving, dropped his wife off and told her he'd be right back.

""I have to go back. I have to help her,"" Wright's wife, Carmen, recalled her husband's words.

So he turned around, picked Hector up, filled up her empty gas can and handed her all the cash he had in his wallet.

""You know when you have an urge and a desire something to do good?"" Carmen told CBS News. ""He was raised that way. He's kind and generous to everyone. He'd never picked up anybody before, but he felt compelled.""

Wright never expected to see the woman again.

YouCaring

Years later, Wright's mother, Judy, fell ill with Parkinson's disease and things started going downhill fast.

The family brought in nursing staff to take care of Judy. In June, they were told she only had weeks left to live.

One nurse's aide, in particular, grew close to Judy.

""She cared for her in the most respectful way. She had the utmost respect for human life,"" Carmen described.

YouCaring

Judy and her husband, Phil, learned about her dreams of going to nursing school. They introduced her to their family, including their son, Chris.

During one of her shifts, the woman told the family about an encounter she had with a stranger back in 2014. She had run out of gas and he circled back to help her.

Wright's jaw dropped. ""That was me.""

The pair couldn't believe it.

""The encounter that had blessed them both three years ago, came full-circle,"" Carmen said. ""We don't believe in coincidence. We're a family of faith.""

Two weeks later, on July 9th, Judy died.

It was Hector's birthday, and she was off that day, but as soon as she heard the news she left her party and rushed to Judy's house.

Even after Judy's passing, Hector continued to visit with Phil. Her dedication meant so much to the family they asked family and friends to donate to the woman's college fund in lieu of sending flowers.

""We overheard her outside talking to an advisor. She owed them money for a few classes,"" Carmen explained. ""She's trying to get to nursing school. We thought we might as well try.""

The family created a YouCaring page, hoping to raise at least $1,000. Within 45 minutes, they already surpassed their goal. As of Wednesday evening, the campaign has raised nearly $20,000.

Days later, they shared the good news with Hector.

""Oh Lord have mercy. Lord, you're so good to me,"" she repeated as Wright told her what they did. ""You're kidding me.""

http://Www.youcaring.com/inhonorofJudyWright A beautiful story from beginning to end. See TunDe's reaction. THANK YOU to all who have been part of this blessing. As requested, will leave the site open for another week. $8,000 raised so far (not all donations visible on funding page) Rom 8:28 In all things, God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose. ❤️ Posted by Carmen Wright on Tuesday, July 18, 2017

Carmen shared a video of Hector's reaction on Facebook and it has since gone viral with nearly 930,000 views.

""I don't know why God chose our two families,"" Carmen said. ""But she's family. It's like she's known us forever."""

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/dave-chappelle-netflix-comedy-fame-leaving-chappelles-show/,cbsnews,"Dave Chappelle on fame, leaving ""Chappelle's Show"" and Netflix special",[],"For more than 30 years, Dave Chappelle has been making people laugh. He studied theater at a performing arts high school in Washington and started sneaking into comedy clubs when he was 14. His career exploded after two hilarious seasons of “Chappelle’s Show” on Comedy Central, and then famously walked away at the height of his success.

“I was talkin’ to a guy… he basically said to me that comedy is a reconciliation of paradox,” Chappelle told “CBS This Morning” co-host Gayle King. “And I think that that was a irreconcilable moment for me. That I was in this very successful place, but the emotional content of it didn’t feel anything like what I imagined success should feel like. It just didn’t feel right.”

Chappelle’s now back, this time with a three-part stand-up comedy special on Netflix, premiering Tuesday.

But Chappelle revealed he does miss his former show. “But ‘Chappelle’s Show’s’ like breakin’ up with a girl and you still like her. But in your mind you’re like, ‘That b**** is crazy. I’m not goin’ back,’” Chappelle said, chuckling.

Chappelle not only left the show, walking away from a $50 million deal, but he also left the country, going to South Africa to escape.

“Did the fame scare you?” King asked.

“Fame, yeah, but not so much that I get on a plane to Africa. Fame is not that kind of scary. But it is – fame is a horrifying concept when it’s aimed at you, you know?” Chappelle said. “At the end of the day, it’s so – you don’t have that much control over it. You just try to conduct yourself as best you can.”

For two seasons his best was Comedy Central’s “Chappelle’s Show.” It was critically acclaimed and wildly popular.

“Even when you walked away in 2005, you were still working. It’s just that we didn’t know all the things that you were doing. You really stayed low,” King said.

“I found an altitude I was comfortable with. I found a way that – to do what I liked to do and avoid some of the parts of it that I was uncomfortable with,” Chappelle said.

“What were you uncomfortable with?” King asked.

“Well, I mean, if you look at me, right, physically – now, I’m, like, 40 pounds heavier than I was when I did ‘Chappelle’s Show.’ And people are like, ‘How did you gain all that weight?’ By resting and eatin’ and payin’ attention to myself. I have actual relationships with my kids,” Chappelle said. “I’ve been all over the country, touring all my life. But I never saw anything. Now I’ve seen everything. I could talk to people or I could – I had time to stop if someone said they liked me. It wasn’t like I brushed past ‘em like, ‘I don’t want to hear it.’ I had time to stop like, ‘You do?’ You know what I mean? It’s like – it was just, like, the way that I engaged the world was different.”

He’s starting to get to a point, he said, where he’d like for his life to “mean something” – like when he went to Allen University in Columbia, South Carolina and wanted to talk to the students. His great-grandfather, Bishop William David Chappelle, was once president of the university.

“It’s okay to be afraid because you can’t be brave or courageous without fear. The idea of being courageous is that even though you are scared, you just do the right thing anyway. So in 2004, I walked away from $50 million and in November, I made a deal for $60 million,” he told the students in a speech at Chappelle Auditorium.

He also went to the church, Chappelle Memorial AME Church, also named after his great-grandfather, a piece of his family’s history he wanted to explore.

Chappelle’s own history is rooted in stand-up comedy. He started performing when he was only 14.

“Do you remember when you got your first laugh?” King asked.

“Yeah, first night I was on stage. I can remember who introduced me. I can remember what my introduction was. I can remember the whole thing,” Chappelle said. “This guy named J.T. Newton, he said, ‘You know, folks, everybody starts somewhere. And tonight this young man is doin’ stand-up comedy for the first time.’ He goes, ‘And who knows? We may be witnessing the birth of a star. Please welcome Dave Chapel [sic].’ That was it.”

“But I did pretty good. They were like screamin’. And he’s like, ‘That’s all for you, kid. That’s all for you.’ But they would treat it like I was in the Make a Wish Foundation or somethin’. And they just wanted to give me a little boost. But it was encouraging, man. And it felt so good, you know? You’ll go through a million bad nights to get those good ones,” Chappelle said.

His good nights now involve “Juke Joints” -- part concert, part party. All Dave.

“You never go to a party where everyone shows up at the same time. But the ‘Juke Joint’ is a kind of party where everyone shows up at the same time,” Chappelle said. “And we start and we finish the night together. And it’s just, like – it’s a very eclectic crowd.”

“What do you want us to feel in there?” King asked.

“It’s like, you know, love and camaraderie and kinship, you know? It’s just a reminder. Like, and my town is so small, you throw an event like that in town, it’s the big dance,” Chappelle said.

CBS News

That small town is about 20 miles outside of Dayton, Ohio, and far away from the pressure of big city life. Sometimes, Chappelle will walk on the streets at night.

“Especially when I first get back from the road if it’s nice out. Scary, too,” Chappelle said.

“Why?” King asked.

“Raccoons. You can hear ‘em, like, rustling in the woods,” Chappelle said.

“You scared of raccoons?” King asked.

“Yeah. Very much so,” he said. “That’s an irrational fear that I just have.”

The town is progressive and artsy, a place Chappelle said he’s treated like a neighbor – not a big star.

“Are you calmer here?” King asked.

“Generally speaking, yeah,” Chappelle said. “I have time to think about things. And I think for a comedian, if you don’t have time to think, you’re just not as effective. That if you-- you know, it gets a little corporate.”

It’s that corporate feel he left behind when he departed Comedy Central, where Key and Peele became the comedians to watch.

“I think there was a speculation that Dave doesn’t like Key & Peele or Dave thinks, ‘Okay,’” King said.

“No. I’m a fan of this show,” Chappelle said.

But when he was doing “Chappelle’s Show,” he said there were “certain conventions of the show that the network resisted.”

“I fought the network very hard so that those conventions could come to fruition,” Chappelle said. “So, like the first episode I do, that black white supremacist sketch. And it’s like, ‘Well, that’s 10 minutes long. It should be five minutes long.’ Why should it be five minutes long? Like, these types of conventions. I fought very hard. … So when I watch ‘Key & Peele’ and I see they’re doing a format that I created, and at the end of the show, it says, ‘Created by Key & Peele,’ that hurts my feelings.”

Right now he’s focused on his new creation: three highly anticipated, multi-million-dollar Netflix specials.

“You tell jokes from everything, from race to politics … do you worry about crossing the line or is there a line that you won’t cross?” King asked.

“Comedy is weird. The line, the line moves. It changes,” Chappelle said, adding, “but I think a lot of, especially in comedy, a lot of it has to do with intent.”

“And your intent is?”

“To make people laugh, to reconcile paradox. I’m, like, just openly – sometimes openly venting. I think that when you get to a certain altitude, there’s more scrutiny over the things you say, ‘cause the platform is so powerful,” Chappelle said."

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/debt-ceiling-will-be-hit-in-october-cbo-estimates/,cbsnews,"Debt ceiling will be hit in October, CBO estimates",['Rebecca Shabad'],"The federal government will exhaust its so-called extraordinary measures and hit the debt ceiling in ""early-to-mid October,"" the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected in a report released Thursday.

Without an increase in the debt limit, CBO said the Treasury can use extraordinary measures ""to continue borrowing and have sufficient cash to make its usual payments"" until that October deadline. The government has been relying on the extraordinary measures since mid-March when the suspension of the debt ceiling expired.

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin called on Congress in May to raise the debt limit before lawmakers leave for the summer in August and specified that it should be a ""clean"" increase -- a demand that the conservative Freedom Caucus has rejected.

Congress was able to wait until October in 2015, the last debt ceiling deadline, to raise it. It was part of a bipartisan budget agreement that also lifted spending levels for two years that applied to defense and non-defense domestic programs.

Budget experts expect the GOP-controlled Congress to produce a similar agreement this fall since Republicans need Democratic votes in the Senate to pass spending bills whose limits will stem from a budget agreement."
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/opioid-crisis-bill-eileen-alley-ohio-family-speaks-out-about-sons-recovery/,cbsnews,"Amid nationwide opioid crisis, Ohio family speaks out about son's recovery",[],"The opioid crisis is sweeping the U.S., leaving many areas across the country with questions as to how to end the epidemic.

In Middletown, Ohio, authorities have already seen more overdose calls this year than in all of 2016. CBS News correspondent Tony Dokoupil got a first-hand look at the problem overwhelming the city.

During his visit, he spoke with Bill and Eileen Alley about the addiction that nearly killed their son, David.

""The heroin started gettin' the better of him,"" Eileen said. ""I kept calling the police on him, hoping the police would arrest him. I spent many days followin' him, wonderin' where he's at, texting my husband, 'Go check on David. Go make sure he's breathing.'""

Bill says they checked on David ""like he was a newborn child.""

""We'd take turns gettin' up in the middle of the night to make sure our son was alive,"" Eileen said. ""I heard signs of, you know, heroin, the dance, the slap, the bouncin'. I call it his heroin dance. And I went down and said, 'David, I can't take it no more. I don't wanna do it no more. I physically am not able to.'""

""Well, he was so high, he cussed me out,"" she continued. ""He called me some names that he's never, ever called me. And I knew, at that moment, that I had to do somethin'. And I went up and told his dad what had happened. And I went to my mom's for the night. And I let him handle it.""

Bill says he ""pointed at the door"" and told David, ""Don't come back until you are off that crap,"" which prompted him to leave.

CBS News

""The last time I seen him, before he overdosed again, he was walkin' down the driveway,"" Bill told Dokoupil. ""And he turned around and looked at me and just smirked and said, 'Take a good look, it's the last time you're gonna see me alive.' And he went and stayed with some people that cared about him.""

According to Bill, David stayed with a group of people -- who aren't drug users -- for about two weeks before he overdosed again.

""They had to kick their bathroom door in to do CPR on him until the ambulance got there,"" he said.

""Even though they're down, they're high on heroin, they still deserve to live,"" Eileen said. They just don't know it.""

""They're consumed by an addiction,"" Bill added. ""You know, there's people out there that don't have any sympathy for people with addictions. And you know, they believe the Narcan should be cut off after three times. All I can say is I hope they never have to change their stance on it. Because if they do, that means something really bad has happened to someone they love.""

Bill and Eileen told Dokoupil that EMS workers in Middletown saved their son's life -- four times. He's now in rehab in Columbus where he's doing well.

Dokoupil asked the couple about Middletown City Coucilman Dan Picard's suggestion that EMS may have to stop responding to calls when patients overdose three times or more.

""It angers me,"" Eileen said. ""That's a death sentence to thousands of people, thousands of people. That's not the answer to the drug problem. That's not the answer to our heroin epidemic. Our town is in crisis, full-blown crisis. We need help. And taking away the narcan is not gonna help. It's gonna make it worse. the bodies are gonna add up. The families are gonna mourn. These people need a chance, like my son had.""

""I do get it,"" Picard told Dokoupil. ""Some of these stories are very heart wrenching. And I feel very sorry for everybody or anybody who has this issue. But people need to understand that I'm a city counselor. My job, as a city counselor, is to make sure this city can continue to function and provide services to its citizens. And at the rate we're going, we've got to do something.""

""Don't get me wrong,"" he continued. ""I think we should save every life we possibly can. But what do we do when we don't have any money?""

Last year, Middletown EMS made 532 runs for opioid overdoses. This year, they've already had more than 600 runs through June. And they're using more naloxone to counter the effects of stronger synthetic drugs.

City leaders say they've surpassed the $11,000 they spent on the treatments last year, and are on pace to spend more than $100,000 this year."

The Facebook video message they posted was shared tens of thousands of times. And on Tuesday, Bailey and Tobias' mom got that kidney in an operation at Allegheny General Hospital, CBS Pittsburgh reports.

Diana Zippay has Alport syndrome, a genetic condition which causes progressive loss of kidney function. The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reports she needed 20 hours a week of dialysis, and no one in her family was a good candidate to be a donor.

""My daughter immediately said, 'We have to make this video. We have to make this video, mom. We need it, you have to get a kidney.' And I said, 'OK, let's see what we come up with,'"" Zippay told the station.

Please help make my children's video go viral. Share, share, share!!! They are trying to reach a thousand shares to save their mommy....lets show them we can do better than that! God Bless. Team Zippay Stromg! 💪🏻 Posted by Diana Zippay on Sunday, March 26, 2017

Zippay received her new kidney thanks to a paired exchange by the National Kidney Foundation.

The unknown altruistic donor in Philadelphia matches her type A blood. But the chain began when a type B donor from Baldwin agreed to donate her kidney to someone else.

Tobias was with his mom when she got the news that a match had been found.

""Tobias misinterpreted her tears as something wrong, but then when he found out, he said, 'Then why are you crying?'"" said Jason Zippay, Diana's husband.

When Bailey found out, Zippay said, ""She was just jumping up and down and excited. We were all laughing and crying. It was just a great moment, a great family moment.""

Dr. Sabiha Hussain says living donors are preferable for kidney transplants.

""On an average, a living kidney transplantation lasts about 16 to 20 years, compared to about eight to 10 years depending on the quality of the deceased donor kidney transplantation,"" said Dr. Hussain.

Zippay had the surgery Tuesday afternoon, and Allegheny County Health Network officials said it was a success. They say her new kidney is working."

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-you-should-replace-coconut-oil-with-healthier-fats/,cbsnews,Why you should replace coconut oil with healthier fats,[],"The American Heart Association (AHA) released a report this week aimed at setting the record straight in the long-running debate over the healthiest fats.

A recent New York Times survey found that 72 percent of Americans think coconut oil is healthy but only 37 percent of nutritionists agree with them.

The AHA says that replacing saturated fats found in coconut oil or butter with vegetable oils like corn or peanut can lower cardiovascular disease by about 30 percent. That's almost the same amount as a cholesterol-lowering statin drug.

CBS News medical contributor Dr. Tara Narula explains that many people believe coconut oil to be healthy because it has been marketed as such with companies touting benefits such as anti-aging, prevention of dementia, and cardiovascular health.

""But the reality is when you look at what coconut oil is made of, 80 percent of it is saturated fat and that's similar to butter which is about 60 percent saturated fat or beef fat which is about 40 percent,"" Narula told ""CBS This Morning."" ""Saturated fat raises the LDL or the 'bad' cholesterol so coconut oil is going to have that same effect as butter and beef fat.""

In recent years, attention-grabbing media headlines have questioned whether or not saturated fat is as bad as previously thought, leading to even more confusion among consumers, Narula points out. But the AHA has stated since the 1960s that saturated fat is detrimental to cardiovascular health.

""The American Heart Association is now coming out very strongly and very clearly with this statement saying that saturated fat increases cardiovascular risk and that you need to look at what you're replacing it with when you take it out of the diet,"" she said.

For example, if replacing it with poly-unsaturated fat, including vegetable oils like corn, soybean, and peanut oil, can lower the risk of heart disease by up to 30 percent.

""If you replace it with mono-unsaturated fats, things like olive oil or avocado, that's good, too [though] not as good as poly-unsaturated fat, but it's pretty good,"" Narula said.

Replacing saturated fat with carbohydrates, refined grains or sugars, there won't be much effect. However, there might be some benefit to whole grains or healthier carbs.

The AHA recommends that people with high cholesterol keep total saturated fat intake to 5 to 6 percent of daily total calories. For people who do not have high cholesterol, that number should be under 10 percent.

""Fat is not fat. I think that it's very confusing for people who think that they're all the same but there really are these big differences and you have to read the labels and you have to look at what you're using."""

But tragedy struck in November 2016 when her grandmother, Brunilda Hernandez, lost a battle to both cancer and Alzheimer's disease.

Now, Hernandez is partnering with the Alzheimer's Association for Alzheimer's & Brain Awareness Month to share her story and help bring attention to the memory-robbing disease that affects an estimated 5.5 million Americans.

CBS News spoke to Hernandez to talk about her relationship with her grandmother, the impact of Alzheimer's on her family, and her advice for others with a loved one living with the disease.

Tell me about your grandmother. What was your relationship like with her?

My family has always been very close. Ever since I was a kid everybody was always together, including my grandma. In the mornings, my mom would work and my grandma would help me get ready and would walk me to school. We were all so close to her.

When did she first get sick and how did that affect your relationship with her?

She started getting sick in mid-2016. I was doing a lot of competitions throughout the year and I wasn't home as much as I usually am. We'd hoped she would get better soon but we did see her spiral downward throughout the year. She had stomach cancer as well as Alzheimer's and the two hit pretty quickly.

Through the Olympics, I could feel that she was watching, and when I came back, the people who had worked with her created a little book for her of all the meets that I did with pictures and descriptions — that way she could go through it. That was really comforting to know that she saw what I did and that she was hopefully proud of it.

What were some of her initial symptoms of Alzheimer's?

She would ask the same questions over and over again. She asked me how my day was at least six times one day. I remember my brother and I didn't understand so we'd look at each other and give her different answers every time to see how she would react but as soon as we figured out what happened, it made sense as to why she kept asking these things.

How did your grandmother's illness affect your family and what was that like for you to watch?

She was my dad's mother and he's kind of the tough guy of the family so to see him so sad over it, which is completely understandable, that was really hard. It made us really grateful for the family we have now and making sure that we took in every moment.

When things were getting really bad, I was away on ""Dancing with the Stars."" My mom would come up [with me] pretty often, my brother's in college, my sister works, my dad works, so everyone was separated and that was hard because at times like that you definitely want to be together.

You found out about your grandmother's death while you were very much in the public light in the middle of your run on ""Dancing with the Stars."" What was that like for you?

When I did find out I got to fly home for the week. So the day after she had passed, I got to come home. I didn't know yet. Nobody had told me, but when I came home my dad sat me down with everybody and told me the news. I didn't cry at first. I don't think it hit me, really, just because I had been traveling so much I'd gotten used to not seeing her as much. So when they told me, I was in shock, I guess. And then a few days later, it hit me and of course it hit when the cameras were on, so that was definitely really hard. But everyone at ""Dancing with the Stars,"" the producers and cast and everybody were really sweet. They had written a card sending all their prayers and there was a lot of support from everyone, so that made it a lot better.

What advice would you have for others who have a family member with Alzheimer's disease?

My advice would be to spend a lot of time with them and take in every moment because you never know when something can happen and so you don't want to have any regrets at the end.

What are some of the things you'd want to share about your grandmother, that you'd want the world to know about?

She was a firecracker. She had a pretty tough heart. The moments she was very sweet, it was adorable, but really she was usually the one who was very loud and the life of the house. She definitely radiated a lot of energy and I think my siblings and I got that from her."

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/do-e-cigarettes-help-tobacco-smokers-quit/,cbsnews,Do e-cigarettes help tobacco smokers quit?,['Steven Reinberg'],"More Americans are giving up cigarettes, and a new study suggests electronic cigarettes may be the reason why.

After stalling for 15 years, the U.S. quit-smoking rate rose to nearly 6 percent in 2014-2015, up from less than 5 percent in prior years, according to national survey data.

Researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine believe e-cigarettes have helped fuel the increase.

""From 2014 to 2015, more e-cigarette users tried to quit cigarette smoking and succeeded in quitting than those who didn't use e-cigarettes,"" said lead researcher Shu-Hong Zhu, director of the university's Center for Research and Intervention in Tobacco Control.

Reviewing survey responses from nearly 25,000 current and former smokers in 2014-2015, Zhu and his colleagues found that ""vapers"" were more likely than nonusers to make a quit attempt (65 percent versus 40 percent). And they were more likely to succeed for at least three months (8 percent versus 5 percent), he said.

A 1 percent increase in the smoking cessation rate represents about 350,000 additional smokers, Zhu said.

In background notes, the researchers said use of electronic cigarettes in the United States became noticeable around 2010 and increased dramatically by 2014 -- which would coincide with the rising quit-smoking rates.

But scientists remain divided over whether e-cigarettes are a ""gateway"" to smoking or a less harmful tool that helps smokers quit. This new study seems to support the second theory.

""People should be open to consider e-cigarettes as a way to help them quit, especially if they have used everything else in the past,"" Zhu said. ""The important thing is that people continue to try.""

Zhu added that a national tobacco control campaign that began airing in 2012 probably also helped boost quit rates.

One specialist emphasized that this paper can't prove that e-cigarettes help people quit.

""All we can say is at a time when e-cigarette use is increasing, successful smoking cessation increased, and the prevalence of adults who smoked dropped,"" said Dr. Steven Schroeder.

""That's circumstantial evidence, but it's pretty persuasive,"" said Schroeder, who heads the Smoking Cessation Leadership Center at the University of California, San Francisco.

Schroeder and Zhu concede that e-cigarettes are probably not completely safe, but are likely less harmful than regular cigarettes.

""If the 40 million smokers in the U.S. switched to e-cigarettes, the nation would be a lot healthier for it,"" Schroeder said.

The best way to quit smoking is to use the currently recommended methods, Schroeder said. ""But if those don't work -- try an e-cigarette.""

For the study, Zhu and colleagues collected data on more than 160,000 people who took part in five surveys between 2001 and 2015. More than 22,500 were current smokers and more than 2,100 were recent quitters.

Among these, nearly half of recent quitters had tried e-cigarettes, the researchers found.

Kenneth Warner, a professor of public health at the University of Michigan, welcomed the findings.

The study authors have used a large data set to address whether e-cigarettes can help adults break the cigarette habit and they determined ""e-cigarettes are helping smokers to quit,"" Warner said.

In the United States, public health organizations have focused almost exclusively on the potential adverse consequences of e-cigarettes for kids, to the detriment of the health of adults who might benefit from a more positive take on e-cigarettes, he said.

""This study suggests that we should be receptive to the kind of approach that health authorities in England have taken, encouraging smokers who cannot quit otherwise to try e-cigarettes,"" Warner said.

""With proper regulation, we could increase the potential of e-cigarettes to reduce the horrific toll of cigarette smoking in our society,"" he added.

In 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration finalized rules to regulate e-cigarettes. However, the Trump administration has delayed the enforcement of these rules.

One limitation of the study is that details on how participants actually stopped smoking weren't available. In addition, the types of e-cigarettes used aren't known, the researchers said.

The report was published July 26 in the medical journal BMJ."

Mr. Trump called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to end the filibuster, which requires 60 votes to advance most legislation. The so-called ""skinny repeal"" bill that collapsed in the Senate early Friday morning was supported by just 49 Republican members.

The very outdated filibuster rule must go. Budget reconciliation is killing R's in Senate. Mitch M, go to 51 Votes NOW and WIN. IT'S TIME! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2017

Mr. Trump said his fellow Republicans in the upper chamber ""look like fools and are wasting time"" by preserving the filibuster.

Republicans in the Senate will NEVER win if they don't go to a 51 vote majority NOW. They look like fools and are just wasting time...... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2017

....8 Dems totally control the U.S. Senate. Many great Republican bills will never pass, like Kate's Law and complete Healthcare. Get smart! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2017

McConnell does not have the power to abolish the filibuster on his own, and has repeatedly said he does not support such a move. Under Senate rules, any change to the filibuster would require a majority of members to vote in favor -- a prospect that is unlikely, given widespread opposition to doing away with the tool.

In April, 61 senators of both parties signed a letter to Senate leaders saying they would oppose eliminating the filibuster for legislation, which allows the minority party to influence bills.

""Regardless of our past disagreements on that issue, we are united in our determination to preserve the ability of members to engage in extended debate when bills are on the Senate floor,"" the letter said.

McConnell likewise dismissed Mr. Trump's entreaties to eliminate the 60-vote requirement weeks later.

""It would fundamentally change the way the Senate has worked for a very long time. We're not going to do that,"" McConnell said in May after Mr. Trump threatened to shut down the government and called for a 51-vote threshold.

In 2013, Democrats in the majority eliminated the ability to filibuster judicial nominees, with the exception of Supreme Court justices. In April, McConnell and Senate Republicans invoked the ""nuclear option,"" after Democrats tried to block a vote on nominee Neil Gorsuch, Mr. Trump's choice to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Antonin Scalia. The move eliminated the 60-vote threshold for nominees to the high court.

But the filibuster remains in place for pieces of legislation. Senate Republicans sidestepped the legislative filibuster in their Obamacare repeal plan by using a legislative process known as reconciliation, which requires just 50 votes to pass measures affecting the budget. The repeal effort collapsed when three Republican senators -- Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and John McCain of Arizona -- voted against a last-ditch effort to pass a slimmed-down bill."
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hawaii-thirty-meter-telescope-mauna-kea-mountain-sacred-native-hawaiians/,cbsnews,New twist in legal battle over big plans for Hawaii mountaintop,[],"HONOLULU -- A construction permit should be granted for a giant telescope planned for a Hawaii mountain summit that some consider sacred, a hearings officer recommended Wednesday.

Retired judge Riki May Amano, who is overseeing contested-case hearings for the Thirty Meter Telescope, had been weighing facts in the case since June, after hearing oftentimes emotional testimony that spanned 44 days.

The $1.4 billion project has divided those who believe the telescope will desecrate land atop Mauna Kea held sacred by some Native Hawaiians and those who believe it will provide Hawaii with economic and educational opportunities.

This isn't the final say on whether the embattled project will proceed.

Now that Amano has issued her 305-page proposed decision and order, the state land board will set a deadline for telescope opponents and permit applicants to file arguments against her recommendations. The board will later hold a hearing and then make the final decision on the project's conservation district use permit.

Gov. David Ige said his office was reviewing the conditions Amano put on her recommendation, including that employees attend mandatory cultural and natural resources training and that employment opportunities be filled locally ""to the greatest extent possible.""

""Regardless of the (land board's) ultimate decision, I support the co-existence of astronomy and culture on Mauna Kea along with better management of the mountain,"" Ige said in a statement.

This second round of contested-case hearings was necessary after the state Supreme Court invalidated an earlier permit issued by the board.

The telescope's board of directors held public meetings before selecting Mauna Kea as the preferred site in 2009. In 2011, opponents requested so-called contested-case hearings before the state land board approved a permit to build on conservation land. The hearings were held, and the permit was upheld. Opponents then sued. In December 2015, the state Supreme Court revoked the permit, ruling the land board's approval process was flawed. That meant the application process needed to be redone, requiring a new hearing.

AP

""TMT welcomes the recommendation that a state permit be issued and we respectfully look forward to the next steps,"" said Executive Director Ed Stone. ""We appreciate that Judge Riki Amano worked carefully and tirelessly to ensure all voices were heard during the contested case hearing.""

Telescope officials have said they plan to build in Spain's Canary Islands if they can't build in Hawaii. The nonprofit international partnership wants to resume construction next year.

Kealoha Pisciotta, one of the leaders fighting against the telescope, said she's disappointed but not surprised. ""They're far from done,"" she said. ""They still have to go before the board. We still have the right of appeal - before anyone can even begin to contemplate any action or earth-moving on Mauna Kea.

Protests disrupted a groundbreaking and Hawaiian blessing ceremony at the site in 2014. After that, the protests intensified. Construction stopped in April 2015 after 31 protesters were arrested for blocking the work. A second attempt to restart construction a few months later ended with more arrests and crews retreating when they encountered large boulders in the road.

The telescope has become one of the most divisive issues in the state, with some telescope supporters saying they are afraid to publicly express their stance on the project.

Telescope officials say Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano, is the best location in the world for astronomy. It's Hawaii's tallest volcano and its summit provides a clear view of the sky for 300 days a year, with little air or light pollution."
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/charlie-gard-baby-at-center-of-international-dispute-dies-in-hospice/,cbsnews,"Charlie Gard, baby at center of international dispute, dies in hospice",[],"LONDON -- Charlie Gard, an 11-month-old baby at the center of an international dispute over treatment of a rare medical condition, has died in hospice care, a family spokeswoman said on Friday.

He would have turned 1 next week.

Charlie suffered from a rare genetic disease, mitochondrial depletion syndrome, which caused brain damage and left him unable to breathe unaided.

His parents, Chris Gard and Connie Yates, raised more than 1.3 million pounds, or $1.7 million, to take him to the United States for an experimental medical therapy they believed could prolong his life. But Charlie's doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London objected, saying the treatment wouldn't help and might cause him to suffer. The dispute ended up in court.

Family of Charlie Gard via AP

Charlie's case became a flashpoint for debates on the rights of both children and parents, on health-care funding, medical interventions, the responsibilities of hospitals and medical workers and the role of the state.

Alison Smith-Squire, a family spokeswoman, confirmed that Charlie died Friday but no further details were released. In a statement, Yates was quoted as saying ""our beautiful little boy has gone, we're so proud of him.""

After months of legal battles, High Court Judge Nicholas Francis ruled Thursday that Charlie should be transferred to a hospice and taken off life support after his parents and the hospital that had been treating him failed to agree on an end-of-life care plan for the infant.

Under British law, it is common for courts to intervene when parents and doctors disagree on the treatment of a child. In such cases, the rights of the child take primacy over the parents' right to decide what's best for their offspring. The principle applies even in cases where parents have an alternative point of view, such as when religious beliefs prohibit blood transfusions.

Reuters/Peter Nicholls

The case made it all the way to Britain's Supreme Court as Charlie's parents refused to accept decisions by a series of judges who backed Great Ormond Street. But the Supreme Court agreed with the lower courts, saying it was in Charlie's best interests that he be allowed to die.

The case caught the attention of Trump and the pope after the European Court of Human Rights refused to intervene. The two leaders sent tweets of support for Charlie and his parents, triggering a surge of grassroots action, including a number of U.S. right-to-life activists who flew to London to support Charlie's parents.

The hospital reported that its doctors and nurses were receiving serious threats over Charlie's case and London police were investigating.

The intervention of two of the world's most powerful men made the case a talking point for the planet. Images of Charlie hooked to a tube while dozing peacefully in a star-flecked navy blue onesie graced websites, newspapers and television news programs.

Medical ethicist Arthur Caplan said the case shows how the medical profession is struggling to adjust to the age of social media, which puts the general public in the middle of decisions that in the past would have been private issues for doctors and the family.

""I do think that in an era of social media, it is possible to rally huge numbers of people to your cause,"" said Caplan, of New York University's Langone Medical Center. ""The medical ethics have not caught up.""

The heated commentary prompted Judge Francis to criticize the effects of social media and those ""who know almost nothing about this case but who feel entitled to express opinions.""

But in the end, the increased attention did little for Charlie.

While offers of help from the Vatican's Bambino Gesu children's hospital in Rome and doctors at Columbia University Medical Center in New York were enough to reopen the case, the High Court ultimately decided the proposed treatment wouldn't help Charlie. His parents gave up their fight on Monday after scans showed that Charlie's muscles had deteriorated so much that the damage was irreversible.

""Mummy and Daddy love you so much Charlie, we always have and we always will and we are so sorry that we couldn't save you,"" his parents wrote when they announced their decision. ""We had the chance but we weren't allowed to give you that chance.

""Sweet dreams baby. Sleep tight, our beautiful little boy."""

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/diabetes-risk-alcohol-study/,cbsnews,Could a little alcohol lower your diabetes risk?,['Dennis Thompson'],"That glass of wine or pint of beer you enjoy with dinner every night might come with an added benefit -- a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, a new Danish study contends.

The researchers found that men who had 14 drinks each week and women who had nine drinks a week appeared to have the lowest risk of type 2 diabetes, compared to nondrinkers or people who drank more heavily, said senior researcher Janne Tolstrup.

People received the most benefit if they spread those drinks out during the week, rather than downing them all in one or two binges, Tolstrup added.

""Drinking pattern seemed to play a role for the risk of diabetes,"" Tolstrup said. ""Drinking frequency was important, as those who were drinking three to four times per week had lower risk as compared to those drinking only once per week -- regardless of the total weekly amount.""

The potential protective effect of alcohol also appeared to be limited to wine and beer, Tolstrup said. Hard liquor provided no benefit to men, and could actually increase a woman's risk of diabetes, the findings showed.

""There seemed to be little beneficial effects from spirits,"" Tolstrup said.

She's a professor of epidemiology with the University of Southern Denmark's National Institute of Public Health in Copenhagen.

But at least one diabetes expert suggested that if you're thinking of drinking just to prevent type 2 diabetes, you might want to put the corkscrew down.

""I wouldn't recommend increasing alcohol consumption on the basis of this study,"" said Dr. Adrian Vella, an endocrinologist and internist with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.

Also, the study only found an association between alcohol consumption and diabetes risk, not a cause-and-effect connection.

The new research included data from the Danish Health Examination Survey. The survey of more than 70,000 people was done in 2007-2008. The participants provided details of their alcohol consumption, lifestyle and overall health. These people were followed through 2012, with an average follow-up of about five years.

The study revealed that men who had 14 drinks per week had a 43 percent lower risk of type 2 diabetes compared to non-drinkers, and women who had nine drinks per week had a 58 percent lower risk compared to non-drinkers.

The risk of type 2 diabetes was lower when people spread their drinking over three or four days a week, rather than drinking once per week. The researchers found a 27 percent lower risk in men and a 32 percent lower risk in women who drank on about half the days of a typical week.

Wine appeared to provide the most protective benefit, as men and women who drank seven or more glasses per week had up to a 30 percent lower risk of type 2 diabetes compared with those having less than one glass per week.

Women didn't benefit at all from drinking beer, but men who drank one to six beers a week had a 21 percent lower risk of diabetes, the investigators found.

Hard liquor provided no benefit to men. Women who had seven or more shots per week had an 83 percent increased risk of diabetes, the study reports.

Researchers can't say why alcohol might protect against diabetes, since this was an observational study rather than an experiment or clinical trial, Tolstrup said.

""Alcohol has been suggested to increase insulin sensitivity and lower fasting insulin resistance, which might play an important role in the progression of diabetes,"" Tolstrup said.

""But again, due to limited knowledge about mechanisms between alcohol and [blood sugar] control, the mechanism explaining our results is not clear,"" she added.

Mayo Clinic's Vella pointed out that studies that depend on people's self-reported food and alcohol consumption can be flawed, since participants may have a hard time remembering what they ate and drank in the past.

It's also tough to accurately capture through a questionnaire other things that might lower type 2 diabetes risk, such as daily exercise and a family history of diabetes.

In addition, it's not likely that a lot of people would develop type 2 diabetes during the relatively short follow-up time of five years used in this study, according to Vella.

The new study was published July 27 in the journal Diabetologia."

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/solar-eclipse-august-21-theres-an-app-for-that/,cbsnews,The August solar eclipse: There's an app for that,['William Harwood'],"For eclipse enthusiasts, amateur astronomers and those with just a passing interest in the Aug. 21 coast-to-coast solar eclipse, look no further than your web browser or smartphone to learn how to make the most of this rare and spectacular event.

Three smartphone/tablet apps stand out: Eclipse Safari (free), Solar Eclipse by Redshift ($1.99), and Smithsonian Eclipse 2017 (free). All three are available for Android and iOS.

Eclipse Safari is from the makers of Sky Safari, one of the leading astronomy programs for computers, tablets and smartphones. Sky Safari code also powers the same interactive map and planetarium view used by the Smithsonian app.

The well-engineered Eclipse Safari features a news feed from Space.com, realtime eclipse updates and will play NASA's livestream during the actual eclipse, showing realtime views from various sites across the nation.

Most useful, the app features a zoomable map of the United States, showing the eclipse path of totality, that lets the user specify a viewing location, either manually or using the phone's GPS.

Eclipse Safari screenshot

Click anywhere on the map and it will show you when the eclipse begins and ends at your location, the duration of totality and even a countdown clock showing when the moon's inner shadow, or umbra, will reach you if you're in the 70-mile-wide path of totality.

If you're not in the path of totality, the app will show when a partial eclipse begins at your location, when it will reach maximum and when it will end. Everywhere in the United States, Canada, Central America and northern South America will see at least a partial solar eclipse.

The Smithsonian's app uses the same Sky Safari-driven map and sky view and includes the NASA TV livestream, along with recent images of the sun taken by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory satellite.

Both apps will draw the sun and moon as they will appear in the user's sky on the day of the eclipse. But the Sky Safari planetarium code, running on a remote server, draws the sky as it appears in daylight and the glare of the sun tends to drown out the moon.

In Sky Safari's desktop and pro astronomy apps, the user can ""turn off"" daylight, making the sun and moon much easier to see against a dark sky. That's not an option in the Sky Safari-driven smartphone apps, but it is in Redshift's Solar Eclipse.

As with Eclipse Safari, the Redshift app allows the user to pick an observing site anywhere in the United States (or use your phone's GPS to pinpoint it for you), instantly generating a table showing when the eclipse starts and stops at that location.

The interactive map is not as useful as the one in the Sky Safari-driven apps because it includes far fewer towns and cities and the dark colors of the display make the path of totality difficult to make out in zoomed-in views.

But the sky scenes showing sun and moon are clearly superior. The user can pull up a scroll bar to move time forward and backward in small increments and turn daylight on or off. The result is a much more attractive rendering, at least to this user. It's not necessary for planning purposes, but it's a huge help when it comes to visualizing the eclipse.

Solar Eclipse by Redshift screenshot

Another extremely useful feature of Redshift's eclipse app is its promised ability to show the weather at the user's location. The app says this feature will become active five days before the eclipse.

The web, of course, offers a wide variety of sites with useful maps, tips, viewing guides and other resources.

As one might expect, NASA has produced one of the more detailed eclipse pages on the web, highlighted by the agency's own interactive Google map of the nation that lets viewers click on any location to find out exactly when the eclipse will begin and end at that site as the moon's shadow races across the nation.

The NASA site provides detailed scientific background, a variety of useful maps, including one that shows details of major eclipse-related events across the country, a roundup of educational activities, instructions for building simple, low-cost pinhole-projection eclipse viewers and detailed safety tips.

The American Astronomical Society offers a remarkably thorough eclipse page, including many of the features of NASA's site. But the AAS also includes links to a wide variety of external pages featuring detailed weather data, state-by-state maps and useful links to various vendors selling certified solar filters, telescopes, binoculars, etc.

Acting as a central clearing house of sorts, the AAS page also provides links to a variety of weather-related pages, including the extremely useful Eclipsophile, which includes realtime weather updates and historical data for sites along the path of totality.

The AAS site also lists available software and eclipse-related apps of interest along with an extraordinarily detailed list of other eclipse-related resources. As one might expect from the nation's leading astronomical organization, the information provided on the AAS site is thorough and reliable. Not surprising given the AAS has been working on eclipse preparations for the past five years.

Solar Eclipse by Redshift screenshot

Like the AAS site, the Great American Eclipse page offers a remarkable variety of resources, from detailed state-by-state maps, to viewing site recommendations, links to vendor sites and a long list of other eclipse websites, including Eclipse2017 . Together, the AAS page and the Great American Eclipse page offer more than enough information to keep one occupied until the eclipse actually gets here.

Another must-see eclipse site is Fred Espenak's EclipseWise.com. Espenak, fondly known as ""Mr. Eclipse,"" is a retired astrophysicist and author of several major works on eclipse science and predictions. His website includes basic and technical background, links to a wide variety of eclipse-related pages and his personal advice on how to photograph an eclipse.

Finally, eclipse enthusiasts should check out Xavier M. Jubier's interactive Google map, which provides critical data about a selected viewing site, including the size of the moon's shadow at that location, it's velocity, eclipse start and stop times and the duration of totality.

Jubier's site also shows maps for historical eclipses and upcoming events, including the solar eclipse that will pass across the central United States in 2024.

There are many, many more eclipse pages and many provide a similar level of detail. But the NASA and AAS sites are hard to beat."

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sunscreen-study-shows-people-apply-it-wrong/,cbsnews,What sunscreen users are doing wrong,['Mary Brophy Marcus'],"Most people don't use sunscreen correctly, a new study shows.

Experts know using sunscreen properly can reduce the risk for skin cancer. And millions of us know we're supposed to do it. But to find out what happens when people actually apply sunscreen in real life, researchers from the University of Minnesota Medical School in Minneapolis set up free sunscreen dispensers at the Minnesota State Fair in 2016. Then they watched as 2,187 people used the dispensers over the next 93 hours.

They discovered that only one-third of people applied the sunscreen to every part of their exposed skin as recommended — and less than half (42 percent) spread sunscreen on their faces.

""Thirty-three percent is actually higher than I thought it would have been, but it was sunny and the free dispenser probably motivated people to do a little better,"" Dr. Darrell Rigel, clinical professor of dermatology at NYU and past president of the American Academy of Dermatology, told CBS News.

When it came to body parts, 51 percent applied sunscreen to their arms, but only 6 percent rubbed it on exposed areas of their chests. The lower extremities were practically ignored with only 3.6 percent of users spreading sunscreen on their legs.

On cloudy days, fewer people used sunscreen at all — even though the researchers note that ""up to 80 percent of the sun's harmful UV rays"" can still reach your skin in cloudy weather.

Their study is published in Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.

To fight skin cancer, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) recommends using one ounce of sunscreen – about the amount that can fit in a shot glass.

""It takes one ounce, theoretically, to cover your whole body,"" said Rigel, who was not involved in the study.

People tend to skimp on sunscreen, applying only 25 to 50 percent of what's really needed, said Rigel. He recommends using a higher SPF product to help compensate for that.

Look for a sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of 30 or higher that says ""broad spectrum"" on the label — meaning that it protects against both UVA and UVB rays.

Wearing sun protective clothing with long sleeves and a hat can also reduce the risk of developing skin cancer.

""With a hat, for every one inch of brim you wear on a regular basis, you lower your skin cancer risk by about 10 percent. A 4-inch brim will lower your skin cancer risk by 40 percent,"" Rigel said.

Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States, according to the AAD. One in five Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime.

Rigel wasn't surprised that women used the sunscreen dispensers more than men in the study, even though the researchers noted that more men attended the fair than women. Women made up 51 percent of fairgoers but 57 percent of sunscreen users.

""Women are better about every health behavior,"" he said, adding that dermatologists know that men delay seeking care when it comes to a spot on the skin that's growing.

Dermatologists say everyone should be using sunscreen, even on overcast days, except for babies under six months of age, whose skin is more porous and sensitive to the chemicals in sunscreens. Rigel recommends parents keep infants out of the sun or well protected in the shade and sun-protective clothing.

Suncreen lasts about two hours then starts to degrade, so you have to keep reapplying for full protection.

""Put it on before you go to work and then when you go out for lunch, reapply it. Most importantly, make sure it's at least SPF 30,"" said Rigel.

All in all, he added, ""I was encouraged that many people used sunscreen, but the study also showed two-thirds of people wouldn't put on free sunscreen, so we have a way to go with public education."""
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sperm-counts-continue-to-plummet-in-western-nations-study/,cbsnews,"Sperm counts continue to plummet in Western nations, study finds",['Dennis Thompson'],"Sperm counts in Western countries have decreased by half in recent years, suggesting a continuing and significant decline in male reproductive health, a new evidence review reports.

Sperm concentration decreased an average 52 percent between 1973 and 2011, while total sperm count declined by 59 percent during that period, researchers concluded after combining data from 185 studies. The research involved nearly 43,000 men in all.

""We found that sperm counts and concentrations have declined significantly and are continuing to decline in men from Western countries,"" said senior researcher Shanna Swan.

""We don't have a lot of data in men from non-Western countries, so we can't draw conclusions about that part of the world,"" added Swan, a professor of environmental medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.

But in Europe, North America, New Zealand and Australia, ""the declines are strong, significant and continuing,"" she said.

The new findings come on the 25th anniversary of the first study to observe a decline in sperm counts, Swan said. The original study, published in 1992, found that sperm counts had declined 50 percent over 50 years.

""The story has not changed over the past 25 years. Whatever is going on, it's not transient and it's not disappearing,"" Swan said. ""When we look at the data for the last five or 10 years, we don't see a leveling off of this decline.""

The continued decline raises concerns about male fertility, and also male health in general, Swan said.

""We are worried about these low sperm counts not only because people have trouble conceiving, but also because men with low sperm counts go on to have higher all-cause mortality,"" Swan said. Studies have shown ""they die younger and they have more disease, particularly cardiovascular disease and cancer,"" she added.

""It really makes the implications of our study much greater,"" she continued. ""We're not talking about making babies. We're also talking about survival and health.""

No one knows why sperm counts continue to decline, but researchers believe it's likely due to factors associated with a modern lifestyle, Swan said. These factors include exposure to man-made chemicals, increased levels of stress, widespread obesity, poor nutrition, lack of physical exercise and smoking.

These factors can temporarily reduce a man's fertility, but researchers think the real damage is being done during exposures occurring in the womb, Swan said.

""Research has found that when a mother smokes, her son has a lower sperm count, regardless of his own smoking,"" Swan said. ""That says what a man is exposed to when he's in utero is important. The mother's exposure will cause a change that stays with the man his entire life.""

Experts are divided on whether the decline in sperm counts will have any impact on male fertility in the near future.

Modern men still have 66.4 million sperm per milliliter of semen, compared with 92.8 million per milliliter from men nearly four decades ago, said Dr. Avner Hershlag, chief of Northwell Health Fertility in Manhasset, N.Y.

""It's not all in the numbers,"" Hershlag said. ""It is estimated about 20 percent of men who have achieved a pregnancy with their partners without treatment have abnormal sperm. There is no proof that parallel to the decline in numbers there has been a decline in the true ability of males to impregnate their partners.""

Furthermore, he said, ""every person you know is the product of one egg and one sperm, so why do we need millions of sperm knocking on the wall of a single egg?""

However, if the trend continues, it could have an impact, said Dr. Peter Schlegel, a professor of reproductive medicine and urologist-in-chief for New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York City.

""It's possible we are seeing a progressive decline in sperm numbers over time, and it could get to the point where it is a significant problem driving many more couples to require fertility treatment,"" Schlegel said.

One potential problem could be that decreased sperm counts reflect an overall decline in sperm quality, Hershlag said.

""If you have a low number of sperm, then these sperm when facing the egg may have a lower capacity to fertilize the egg and lead to the creation of an embryo and, subsequently, a human being,"" Hershlag said. ""But that's not been proven scientifically.""

The study appears in the July 25 issue of the journal Human Reproduction Update."

The videos went viral and catapulted ISIS onto the world stage.

For the parents of one of those Americans, Art And Shirley Sotloff, the murder of their 31-year-old son Steven was shattering, because of the brutality of his execution, and because they think he could've been saved if not for what even the White House now admits was its own ineffectiveness in dealing with the crisis. But, as we reported in January, what really sealed their son's fate, the Sotloffs believe, is the government's policy against paying ransom.

Personal photo

[Video: I am Steven Joel Sotloff. I'm sure you know exactly who I am by now and why I am appearing before you.]

Steven Joel Sotloff was beheaded by ISIS. His execution, on September 2, 2014, was seen around the world on a video.

Lesley Stahl: Did you ever watch it?

Art Sotloff: I have viewed Steven's body with his head on his chest.

Shirley Sotloff: I had to see that 'cause I needed to be sure that that was him.

Steven was born and raised in Miami, attended college in Israel, and became a freelance journalist, reporting from war zones where information was scarce, like Yemen, Benghazi, Libya and Syria where he went in the summer of 2013.

Just before he crossed into Aleppo, he called his dad.

Art Sotloff: He contacted me and told me not to worry, and, but if I don't hear from him within four days, that I should get in touch with one of his colleagues.

Lesley Stahl: Oh, that's ominous.

He didn't hear from his son. Not just for four days. It was four excruciating months. Then, finally they got a ransom letter with demands for the government to free all the Muslims in U.S. custody.

AP

Note to readers: In reporting our story on Steven Sotloff, we spoke with, among others, the family of American photojournalist Luke Somers. Just a month after Sotloff was captured by ISIS in Syria in 2013, Somers was seized in Yemen by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Like Sotloff, Somers tragically died in late 2014 while in captivity. Along with a South African teacher, Somers was shot by his captors during a Navy SEAL rescue attempt.

Shirley Sotloff: ""Then there is a last option. €100 million will secure Steven's release.""

Lesley Stahl: --which is something like 100--

Art Sotloff: $137 million.

Lesley Stahl: What was your reaction?

Shirley Sotloff: Reaction was how the hell are we going to get this money together?

They thought the U.S. government would help them, but they were bewildered and then infuriated when they say they met a stone wall, the U.S. policy forbidding the paying of ransom.

Lisa Monaco: It's some of the hardest work that I've done.

Lisa Monaco, was assistant to President Obama for counterterrorism. She oversaw the hostage crisis.

Lisa Monaco: These are horrible choices. On the one hand, if you don't pay a ransom, you are putting an innocent life at risk. On the other hand, if you do, you're fueling the very activity that's put them at risk in the first place.

Lesley Stahl: Did you feel ever that the policy might be wrong?

Lisa Monaco: The policy that's been a decades-old policy of not paying ransom, I think is the right policy.

Lesley Stahl: So you didn't question that.

Lisa Monaco: We didn't. We believed that that was important to maintain.

But with the exception of the UK, most European countries do pay ransom -- without publicly admitting it. Steven was held with 22 other hostages, including the three Americans James Foley, Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller, who were all killed. Once the European governments paid ransom, ISIS released their citizens, one of whom smuggled out this letter from Steven.

CBS News

Art Sotloff: He was speaking how he can't stand seeing all the captives leave from all different countries. How could the United States just stand by and not do anything?

As the European hostages came out and spoke of mock executions and waterboardings, the Sotloffs decided they would try to raise at least some of the money themselves. But then they and the other U.S. families attended a meeting in Washington with officials on the National Security Council.

To learn about where to receive support for hostage victims and their families, visit Hostage US, an independent nonprofit that offers guidance during and after a kidnapping.

Art Sotloff: All of us were saying, ""Well, why can't we try to save our kids? And they said, ""Because it's against the law. We do not negotiate with terrorists.""

Lesley Stahl: Did they say you would be prosecuted?

Art Sotloff: They said, ""You could be prosecuted, and also your donors could be prosecuted.""

Lesley Stahl: So if I gave you money, I could be prosecuted?

Shirley Sotloff: Yes--

Art Sotloff: Correct.

Lesley Stahl: Did anybody say, ""Are you kidding me?""

Art Sotloff: Yes, they did. Yes, they did.

Lesley Stahl: So it was a little bit contentious.

Art Sotloff: Oh yeah. We kind of verbally fought back.

Lesley Stahl: They were threatened that they could be prosecuted. Is that true?

Lisa Monaco: So what's true is that some families felt threatened. And that was unacceptable. And that should never have happened.

Lesley Stahl: Are you suggesting they may not have been threatened?

Lisa Monaco: No. What I'm suggesting is, I wasn't present when any threats were made, but what matters, Lesley, is that these families felt that way as they were going through the most horrific time they will ever encounter.

Lesley Stahl: But was that the policy? Was that true? Could they have actually been prosecuted? Could someone who contributed to pay ransom also be prosecuted?

Lisa Monaco: So what's true is that the Justice Department has never prosecuted a family or friends of a family that has paid a ransom.

Lesley Stahl: But was it the policy?

Lisa Monaco: Well, what's, the, the policy is the United States Government will not pay ransoms or make concessions to terrorist hostage takers.

That policy is based in part on a presumption that paying ransom invites more hostage taking. But that is refuted by a new study that examined the case of every known Western hostage taken since 911. It was co-authored by Peter Bergen, a counterterrorism expert, for the non-partisan New America Foundation.

Peter Bergen: They don't know necessarily you're American when they take you. It's sort of a target of opportunity. So some countries are known to pay ransom – the French, the Germans, the Spanish.

Lesley Stahl: Even though, they don't admit it.

Peter Bergen: They don't admit it, but they do. Their citizens have much better outcomes than Americans. Americans are huge outliers here. You're twice as likely to have a negative outcome compared to every other Western hostage.

Lesley Stahl: You say negative outcome. You mean murdered.

Peter Bergen: Murdered, die in captivity or just remain in captivity.

Fourteen of the European hostages held with Steven made it home. Those from countries that don't pay ransom didn't: four Americans and two Brits died.

Lesley Stahl: I keep playing in my own head this horrible situation where the American hostages watched the other ones be set free. And I wonder if it wouldn't have been better if, if our government did what the European governments did, which was pay ransom but then deny it in order to save their citizens. Why couldn't we have done that?

Lisa Monaco: We'd still be fueling their terror activity. Whether it's hostage taking or whether it's terrorist plots, to kill Americans here in the homeland or elsewhere, is not activity that the United States government should be in the business of funding.

Lesley Stahl: What do you say to critics of the policy of not paying ransom? That the beheadings of the Americans ended up having more value to ISIS than any money would have been. That's really what put them on the international map. These beheading videos were a gold mine for ISIS. Do you, do you see it that way?

Lisa Monaco: I don't. And-- I think it's giving brutal, murderous thugs too much credit.

Lesley Stahl: What about the argument that if you pay ransom you're just encouraging them to kidnap more? But also that the money is going to go toward terrorism. And so what's the come back to that? It's a hard thing.

Art Sotloff: Going back to what President Obama said to us in person that he would do anything in his power to save his children if he was in the same situation. And I say that he should put himself in the same situation. And I think that the government has a responsibility to protect its citizens in whatever way that they can.

Lesley Stahl: What do you say when you hear people argue that Steven knew he was putting his life at risk by going into Syria at that point and, you know, kinda the burden's on him?

Art Sotloff: Steven was driven by truth. That he had to report the truth. He saw that there wasn't information coming out of these areas. And that's really what drove him.

In the summer of 2014, nearly a year after Steven was abducted, President Obama ordered a military operation to rescue the hostages.

Lisa Monaco: This involved a number of, a large number of military service members and special operators who—

Lesley Stahl: Putting their lives on the line.

Lisa Monaco: Putting their lives on the line. Going into the heart of ISIL territory in Syria. And as we were monitoring the operation, word came back, some very devastating words: ""It's a dry hole,"" which meant that they weren't there.

[Jihadi John: This is James Wright Foley.]

About seven weeks later, James Foley became the first of three American hostages beheaded. Steven appears at the end of the video.

[Jihadi John points knife at camera: The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.]

The Sotloffs then received an audio message that sounds like Steven was forced to record, designed to pressure the U.S. government. It was given to them by the FBI.

Art Sotloff: This is always tough for me, because it's actually his voice. And it just makes me feel like he's still in the room with us.

""To Mom, I do not have much time and will probably not get this opportunity again so I would like to get straight to the point. My life depends on Obama's next decision. Mom, please don't let Obama kill me. Mom you can still save my life just like the families of my previous cellmates whom I'm sure you've met. Fight for me, I love you.""

Shirley Sotloff: Powerful.

Art Sotloff: I gotta blow my nose. I'm sorry. If I could excuse myself.

Lesley Stahl: It's OK. It's cruel.

Shirley Sotloff: Very. I don't know what they wanted us to do.

Lesley Stahl: And always saying ""mom"" like that.

Shirley Sotloff: Mom.

Lesley Stahl: Mom, mom.

Shirley Sotloff: Yeah.

They learned of Steven's death a few days after that.

Art Sotloff: And he's in a much better place.

Shirley Sotloff: We know he's in a better place.

Art Sotloff: And, you know, he isn't suffering anymore.

A couple of months later, they met with President Obama.

Art Sotloff: I asked the president, I said, ""How did you feel when my son was being held up by his neck and they were saying that this message is for you, President Obama. Steven's life depends on your next decision. How do you feel about that?"" And he looked down and he really couldn't answer the question. I guess it's a question that shocked him 'cause it shocked me that I even asked him that.

Lesley Stahl: How do you feel now about what happened? Maybe your role with the families whose kids were beheaded.

Lisa Monaco: I feel like in many respects, we did not do right by these families. That we failed them.

Lesley Stahl: You feel you, you failed the families?

Lisa Monaco: We have Americans who were brutally killed.

After the beheadings, she put together a task force to review how the government handles hostage taking, that included a meeting with the families.

Lisa Monaco: It was a lot of raw emotion and a lot of frustration and grief.

Lesley Stahl: Anger at you?

Lisa Monaco: Anger at us. Anger at the loss of their loved ones. Anger at the government

One of the task force's conclusions was that the various government agencies working on hostages were not coordinating with each other, which led to the creation of this new unit.

Led by the FBI, it brings together all the key agencies that work on hostages including the CIA, Defense and State Departments – in one place to work side by side, 24/7. They share intelligence and keep the families informed.

However, the no-ransom policy was not changed, it wasn't even reviewed, though the Justice Department, in this public document, all but promised not to prosecute a family or their friends who do pay ransom to terrorists.

Lesley Stahl: Is it a good policy now? Are you happy with the way it has turned out?

Art Sotloff: It's a better policy than what it was. I mean, now it gives at least people the opportunity to try to save their family members.

Lesley Stahl: Uh-huh (affirm).

Art Sotloff: But I think it's far from really solving the problem because there is still money that has to be raised and paid. And the average family just can't do that.

Lesley Stahl: And you think our government should.

Art Sotloff:: Absolutely.

Shirley Sotloff: It's a human life. How do you let an American go like that, just let them be killed and murdered? Every human is valuable. Everybody has a family, and they want them to come home.

The Sotloffs have started a foundation in Steven's memory called ""2LIVES"" that among other things funds safety training for freelance journalists traveling to war zones.

On the political front, with dozens of Americans still being held hostage, President Trump has maintained the U.S. policy of not paying ransom.

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/soyuz-blasts-off-carrying-3-man-crew-to-station/,cbsnews,Soyuz rocket carries 3-man crew to space station,['William Harwood'],"After a picture-perfect launch from Kazakhstan and a problem-free rendezvous, a Russian Soyuz spacecraft docked at the International Space Station Friday, boosting the lab's crew back to six and, for the first time, giving NASA and the European Space Agency four astronauts devoted to research in the U.S. segment of the complex.

With commander Sergey Ryazanskiy monitoring an automated approach, flanked on his left by NASA flight engineer Randy Bresnik and on the right by Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli, the Soyuz MS-05 spacecraft docked at the Earth-facing Rassvet module at 5:54 p.m. ET.

The linkup came about six hours after the crew blasted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, at 11:41:12 a.m., departing from the same pad that was used to launch Sputnik 60 years ago and Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, in 1961.

Nearly two hours after docking, after verifying an airtight seal between the space station and the Soyuz, hatches were opened and Expedition 52 commander Fyodor Yurchikhin, flight engineer Jack Fischer and Peggy Whitson, NASA's most experienced astronaut, welcomed their new crewmates aboard with hugs and handshakes.

NASA

The six-member crew then floated into the Russian Zvezda module for a traditional post-docking video call to family and friends back at the launch site. NASA's acting administrator, Robert Lightfoot, congratulated the crew on a spectacular launch and then passed the phone to the crew's families.

""Hi, Wyatt. What'd you think of that rocket launch?"" Bresnik asked his young son.

""It was bright and loud. And interesting.""

""Well, maybe someday you'll get a chance to ride on one,"" Bresnik replied.

""That would be nice,"" Wyatt said. ""I just want to tell you I love you, and we'll miss you.""

After speaking with daughter Abigail, who managed a shy ""hi, poppa,"" and his father, Albert, Bresnik thanked his wife Rebecca for ""the amazing love and support you've given me the last two years to get to this point. I hope we can make you proud while I'm up here.""

He then took a moment to thank the Russian engineers who assembled the Soyuz rocket and spacecraft, saying ""that was the most amazing, smooth rocket ride I've ever had. I would really like to say thanks on behalf of the three of us to our Russian colleagues and our Russian partners who made such a beautiful vehicle.""

Bresnik, an F/A-18 TOPGUN pilot with more than 6,000 hours flying time in high-performance aircraft, spent 10 days in space as a shuttle crew member during a 2009 space station assembly mission.

Ryazanskiy, with a doctorate in biomedicine, is the first scientist-cosmonaut to serve as a Soyuz commander. He spent 166 days aboard the station in 2013-14 and commanded one of three international crews during a 500-day simulated Mars mission in 2009. Nespoli, making his third spaceflight, has logged 174 days in orbit.

They now join Yurchikhin, Fischer and Whitson, who have had the station to themselves since June 2 when Soyuz MS-03 commander Oleg Novitskiy and European Space Agency astronaut Thomas Pesquet returned to Earth. With the arrival of the Soyuz MS-05 crew, an additional USOS crew member will be available to carry out research.

The expanded Expedition 52 crew will include four astronauts assigned to the U.S. segment of the station -- Fischer, Whitson, Bresnik and Nespoli -- and two in the Russian segment -- Yurchikhin and Ryazanskiy.

The station crew normally is evenly split between the Russians and the U.S. segment, which includes astronauts representing NASA, ESA, Japan and Canada. But the Russian space agency Roscosmos recently decided to reduce its crew complement to save money and that opened up additional Soyuz seats for U.S. orbital segment (USOS) astronauts.

NASA/Roscosmos

With the arrival of the Soyuz MS-05 crew, an additional USOS crew member will be available to carry out research.

""The big thing is we're going to have four USOS crew members, and with over 330 possible experiments, of which 85 are new to the space station, there's a ton of science for us to do,"" Bresnik said in a pre-launch news conference.

""And with that extra crew member, we're going to have a lot more opportunity to not only do the science, we're also going to have the opportunity to do repairs on the station,"" Bresnik said. ""So we think the productivity of this huge laboratory ... will really go up quite a bit having a fourth crew member.""

Ryazanskiy, who will join Yurchikhin for a spacewalk Aug. 17, said having only two Russian crew members aboard will require some Russian research to be carried out in their spare time, but he does not anticipate any problems.

""We will be really busy because there will only be two of us,"" he said. ""I have a lot of science that is now going on the task list so some experiments will be done in my free time aboard the station. But overall, for life support and technical issues, two Russian crew members will be enough.""

Yurchikhin, Fischer and Whitson are scheduled to return to Earth Sept. 3. They will be replaced Sept. 13 by Soyuz MS-06 commander Alexander Misurkin, NASA flight engineer Mark Vande Hei and astronaut Joe Acaba. It will be the second expedition with four USOS crew members.

Ryazanskiy, Bresnik and Nespoli will return to Earth on Dec. 14. Between now and then, the overlapping station crews will carry out multiple spacewalks, help with the departure of one Soyuz and the arrival of another and unload four cargo ships -- one Russian Progress, two SpaceX Dragons and one Orbital ATK Cygnus.

And throughout it all, the station crew will carry out a full slate of scientific research.

""I am excited about having a full complement of people up here who can really utilize this amazing laboratory,"" Fischer said in a recent interview with CBS News.

""This will be the first time where we have four USOS, we're have three Americans and an Italian, Paolo, working on the U.S. segment on science. Four people. That's crazy talk!"" Fischer added. ""I'm super excited about how much science we're going to be able to get done with all four people. So, overall, it's awesome, I cannot wait ... for the discoveries that we make together."""

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-is-leading-the-way-in-renewable-energy/,cbsnews,The future of renewable energy is in Texas,['Irina Ivanova'],"Renewable energy isn't at a crossroads in the U.S. so much as on a two-lane highway: While the federal government hits the gas on fossil fuels, states are speeding ahead to develop renewable energy -- and reaching new milestones.

For example, enough solar energy is being collected every year to power all the single-family homes in Florida. Three states generate more than one-third of their energy from wind and solar. Some 160,000 electric cars were sold last year -- enough to supply the entire population of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. And earlier this year, wind and solar produced one-tenth of the nation's energy for an entire month.

A recent report highlights the states that are most quickly embracing renewable energy. And the leaders are not what many people might expect. Yes, California has some of the most pro-environment laws on the books. But the state that produces the most renewable energy in terms of sheer quantity? It's Texas. The states that generate the largest portion of their power from renewables: Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas and the Dakotas.

Source: Environment America/Frontier Group

""If you look at the leadership states, they're states that recognize both the environmental and economic benefits of renewables,"" said Rob Sargent, a co-author of the report and director of the energy program at Environment America, which champions the use of ""clean"" energy.

Texas is one such example. The state set renewable energy goals back in 1999, and again in 2005, which it has since far surpassed. It now produces more wind energy than most countries. The U.S. now generates more power from wind turbines than from hydroelectric dams. Earlier this year, the use of wind power reached a record high, with more than half of the power in a number of Great Plains states coming from wind.

""It's now taken off to the point where if you're just doing the math, you would conclude that wind makes sense because it's just a cheaper resource,"" Sargent said.

The city of Georgetown, Texas, with a population of 50,000, powers itself entirely with renewable energy. It made the switch in 2012 because of cost. Wind was less volatile than gas and oil prices.

Iowa, another leader in both wind and solar, had a different route. It's second only to Texas in the amount of renewable energy it produces, but the state itself ""doesn't have that many remarkable energy policies,"" Sargent said. ""But it's got an immense resource, particularly in one part of the state, and it's surrounded by states that have very strong policies, like Wisconsin and illinois.""

Having states that prioritize renewables creates a willing market for energy, and Iowa sells to those states, he added.

Source: U.S. Department of Energy, Berkeley Lab

Scale is the driving factor making energy cheaper. Unlike fossil fuels, which must be continuously extracted from the ground to provide energy, power generated from the sun and wind is essentially free, advocates say.

""With renewable technology, literally 90-plus percent of the cost associated with it is the initial capital investment, because you don't pay for the fuel,"" Sargent said.

As more and more capacity comes online, the cost per unit of energy drops. Those economics have been causing the price of solar and wind power to drop. Solar is set to become the cheapest power source on Earth in a handful of years, below coal, Bloomberg News recently reported.

And the use of solar power is growing across the U.S. The amount of solar power currently being collected is enough to fulfill all the energy needs of 5 million single-family homes. About 29 states have total populations under 5 million.

Source: Environment America/Frontier Group

One criticism of renewable energy is that it can be inconsistent. Relying only on wind or solar in a given place puts people at the mercy of changing weather. But the growth of storage technology over the past decade ameliorates that issue. A number of states -- including Illinois, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania -- have increased their capacity to store energy. That means for the first time, batteries are ""a viable and flexible option for expanding energy storage capacity,"" according to the report.

Besides being useful for renewable energy -- allowing power collected on a sunny day to be used later when it's raining, for example -- better batteries also makes things like electric cars more efficient, potentially allowing for more time between charges.

These technological improvements are happening at the same time as Americans are using less energy overall. Over the past decade, the amount of total energy use in the U.S. dropped 3.6 percent, despite a growing population and an expanding economy. Every American is using 10 percent less energy than they were in 2007, regardless of where it comes from.

It's not immediately obvious why Americans are using less energy. The cost of power, even of fossil fuel, is historically low, and we haven't exactly been denying ourselves. But our technologies are getting more efficient. Gadgets from light bulbs to cars are evolving to get more juice from the same amount of power.

While the impetus for this innovation sometimes comes from government -- such as fuel efficiency standards for cars, which the White House would like to roll back -- the benefit of wasting less energy translates into cost savings for the consumer, a proposition with nearly universal popularity.

This is also playing out in the construction industry, with the growing use of energy-efficient buildings. Heating and cooling can consume half the money spent on a home every year; the prospect of saving funds makes efficiency attractive to many homeowners.

Industry watchers predict the trend will continue with industrial real estate, as well. ""We do NOT see the strong market trend toward 'green' buildings in the U.S. going into reverse, despite the deregulatory tone at the top in Washington,"" research firm Jones Lang LaSalle wrote in March.

Given the market logic in favor of both trimming energy waste and moving to renewable power, industry observers generally don't believe the federal government's policy reversals can completely derail the shift to clean energy. Environmental advocates, however, worry that the waffling not only slows down progress, but also keeps a growing part of the economy from reaching its full potential.

""From an environmental point of view, we want to be going faster, not slower,"" Sargent said. ""We don't want to waste time by having our foot on both the accelerator and the brake."""

It has even surpassed war-torn Syria, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.

At least four journalists have been killed in Mexico this year. CPJ has directly linked all of those to murders to the reporters' work, while the motive behind another death is still being investigated.

""Every journalist in Mexico is a target,"" said freelance journalist Luis Chaparro who works in Juarez, a city the Mexican state of Chihuahua.

He spoke with correspondent Manuel Bojorquez as part of the upcoming CBS News primetime series ""CBSN: On Assignment,"" which premieres on CBS and CBSN on July 31 at 10 p.m. ET.

""I, as many of my colleagues, feel very, very unprotected,"" Chaparro said.

Several factors have brought cartel violence roaring back in Chihuahua and other parts of Mexico -- from fragmented cartels fighting for turf and influence over government officials to rising opioid use in the United States.

""They just killed my colleague Miroslava recently,"" said Chaparro. ""I felt like that f------g bullet was too close for me.""

Miroslava Breach, who reported on drug cartels and corruption, was shot eight times in March as she drove away from her Chihuahua home. Police have identified two suspects in her murder, but no one has been arrested.

It's estimated 90 percent of murders of journalists in Mexico are unsolved or not thoroughly prosecuted.

""Perpetrators are not arrested and not punished,"" said Carlos Lauria, CPJ's Program Director for the Americas, ""and they do it because they feel like there is no consequence.""

The CPJ estimates that more than 40 journalists have been killed for their work in Mexico since 1992. In 50 other murders, a motive has still not been confirmed.

Mexico's federal government has implemented a program to protect journalists who have been threatened, but Lauria said it's clearly not working.

The killings, he said, are a threat to Mexican democracy. ""It's affecting the fundamental human rights of all Mexicans for freedom of expression and access to information,"" Lauria said."
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/angelina-jolie-bells-palsy-diagnosis/,cbsnews,Angelina Jolie's Bell's palsy diagnosis sparks questions about condition,['Ashley Welch'],"Angelina Jolie is opening up about new health struggles, among other personal matters, in an interview in the latest issue of Vanity Fair.

The actress revealed that she was diagnosed last year with Bell's palsy, a form of temporary facial paralysis caused by damage or trauma to the facial nerves. The condition caused one side of her face to droop, she said.

Jolie told Vanity Fair that addition to Bell's palsy, she's also been diagnosed with hypertension.

""Sometimes women in families put themselves last,"" she told the magazine, ""until it manifests itself in their own health.""

Jolie is no stranger to openly discussing her health. In 2013, she chronicled her decision to have a preventive double mastectomy in an op-ed for the New York Times after she learned she had a BRCA1 gene mutation, which raised her risk for breast cancer. Two years later, she had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed as a preventive measure against ovarian cancer.

In the latest interview, Jolie said she was treated with acupuncture and has made a full recovery from Bell's palsy.

What is Bell's palsy?

According to the National Institutes of Health, about 40,000 Americans suffer from the condition each year.

The most visibly affected muscles are those controlling blinking of one eye and one side of the smile.

The exact cause of Bell's palsy is unknown, but doctors have a theory.

""Once other potential causes of facial paralysis are excluded, including tumor, Lyme disease, and shingles, the specific cause of Bell palsy is usually not identified,"" said David Simpson, M.D., director of the Neuromuscular Division in the Department of Neurology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. ""The major prevailing theory concerning the cause of Bell palsy is that it is an immune reaction of the facial nerve in response to a viral infection.""

As CBS News medical contributor Dr. David Agus explained on ""CBS This Morning,"" ""A nerve comes off the brain through a small hole in the skull, and when it gets inflamed, its function is compromised. And it can get inflamed, primarily, we think, through viral infection.""

The condition comes on suddenly, often without warning.

Simpson says treatment can include measures to protect the exposed cornea of the eye if blinking is impaired, including use of artificial tears or lubricating ointment and wearing a patch at night. Physical therapy can also help.

""Fortunately most patients make an excellent recovery,"" he said.

In fact, Agus said, ""Most of the time it resolves on its own [in] three to four weeks, sometimes up to six months. You can give steroids or antivirals, which can sometimes shorten the duration.""

But he was skeptical of Jolie's use of acupuncture to treat the condition.

""Acupuncture's been tried in several trials and unfortunately it didn't work. I think time itself is the great healer for Bell's palsy,"" Agus said.

In rare cases, the symptoms may never completely disappear, and occasionally the disorder may recur, either on the same or the opposite side of the face.

""For the minority of patients that have incomplete recovery of facial strength or have other residual deficits including facial spasm, treatments may include botulinum toxin injections and various surgical procedures to restore facial symmetry,"" Simpson said."

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/solar-eclipse-what-to-wear-to-protect-your-eyes/,cbsnews,Solar eclipse viewing: What to wear to protect your eyes,[],"As anticipation for the August 21 total solar eclipse builds across the U.S., NASA is issuing a warning: don't be reckless with your eyes.

NASA

The total solar eclipse — a much-anticipated celestial event in which the moon completely obscures the sun, transforming day into night — is expected to be visible to anyone within a roughly 70-mile-wide path stretching from Oregon to South Carolina. Those in other areas of North America will still see a solar eclipse, but only a partial one.

It will be the first total solar eclipse visible from coast to coast in the continental U.S. since 1918, and millions of Americans are looking forward to catching a glimpse.

But the safety stakes are high. A solar eclipse, viewed without adequate eye protection, is powerful enough to blind you. Even the smallest sliver of a crescent sun peeking out from behind the moon is enough to potentially permanently scorch your retinas, according to ophthalmologists.

Viewing the total solar eclipse requires specific eclipse glasses or hand-held solar viewers. Regular sunglasses won't do the job. According to NASA, there are only four eclipse glasses and solar viewers on the market certified to meet international safety standards:

Be sure to inspect your solar filter before the eclipse, and don't use it if it's scratched or damaged, the experts advise.

Another option is to view the eclipse through #14 welder's glass. That's much darker than the shades arc welders typically wear, and NASA warns that only #14 or darker is adequate to protect your eyes in an eclipse.

NASA's strict advice: Unless you're in the narrow zone where the eclipse will be total, keep your special glasses on throughout the eclipse. The only time it's safe look without glasses is during the moments of totality, when the sun is completely and totally blocked by the moon — and beware, that phase may only last a minute or two in some locations.

NASA's local listings detail when the total solar eclipse with start and end at different locations across the country.

NASA

As the moon moves across the sun, the lower atmosphere of the sun will slowly begin to peek out in the shape of a crescent, according to NASA. That is the signal to stop looking directly at the eclipse and again grab your glasses before the first flash of sun emerges around the moon's edges.

You could also consider observing the eclipse through a pinhole camera. NASA has more detailed safety information here."

A California teacher posted a video of border patrol agents detaining her after she refused to say if she was a U.S. citizen at a checkpoint in New Mexico, about 35 miles from the border.

The video has many wondering if she was within her rights or had an obligation to comply.

When San Diego resident Shane Parmely was stopped at a New Mexico border patrol station she refused to answer the agent's questions. She was heading home from vacation with her three children and asked one of them to start recording the exchange.

The videos have generated thousands of views on Facebook and sparked a heated debate on immigration rights.

The middle school teacher says she did it after hearing her Latino friends talk about their experiences at checkpoints.



""It made me feel sick to get asked, knowing what my friends have been through. It just made me feel physically ill,"" Parmely said.

CBS News

""They do more than ask that I'm a citizen. They will ask where my kids go to school, they'll ask what grade they're in. They'll ask what type of job I have,"" said Gretel Rodriguez, one of Parmely's friends.



In the video, Parmely asked, ""So what's the grounds? What's the violation for being detained?"" The border patrol agent responded, ""You know what? Just for you. Here you go, U.S. Supreme Court.""



The Supreme Court does allow agents to set up checkpoints within 100 miles of the border and ask questions about citizenship without warrants.



""She had the right to remain silent. She had the right to question why was she being detained,"" said Victor Nieblas, former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

Asked what kind of avenues border patrol agents have to verify citizenship, Nieblas said, ""Well, they need a reasonable suspicion that the individual is either committing a crime or is here unlawfully and that's difficult to ascertain by someone just saying I don't want to answer a question.""



On Facebook, some applauded Parmely's activism while others criticized her actions.

One person wrote, ""I am sorry but you are disrespectful. The boarder [sic] patrol is doing a job that must be done.""

""There are a lot of criticisms that seem to basically be on this logical fallacy that if you question authority, you're disrespectful. And I disagree,"" Parmely said.

Parmely says she was let go after 90 minutes without answering the question.



In a statement, the border patrol says they may detain a driver for a reasonable amount of time until they can make a determination about immigration status.

It says its policy is to treat all individuals with dignity and respect."

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/marlin-gipson-video-viral-confrontation-harris-county-constable-texas/,cbsnews,Police defend cop after video of confrontation with black man goes viral,['Omar Villafranca'],"DALLAS -- A police supervisor in Texas is defending the actions of a constable who was in a confrontation last week with a young man. Millions have seen the cellphone video, and some believe the constable crossed the line.

The cellphone video captures a moment when a Harris County constable stopped 20-year-old Marlin Gipson as he and his brothers were passing out business cards for his lawn service last week.

CBS News

""I'm kind of busy, I'm trying to make money,"" Gipson can be heard saying in the video.

The officer then says, ""Yeah, but when I saw you, you were going from door to door.""

Gipson did not have an ID card on him when asked by the officer.

Then, the situation got tense, after Gipson asked the constable for his information.

""Tell you what,"" the officer says. ""Just turn around and put your hands around your back.""

""For what? Hey! Nope,"" Gipson says.

He instead left the scene.

Gipson spoke with CBS News and showed us the business cards he was handing out.

""I would still be doing this right here,"" Gipson said as he fanned out the cards in his hand. ""Lawn service, making money that's the goal… trying to support our family.""

CBS News

Constable administrator Alen Rosen said Gipson left because of an outstanding misdemeanor assault warrant.

""So when originally stopped and questioned by the officer, that was why he really didn't want to say who we was,"" Rosen said.

Constables came to his house later that day. Gipson recorded that, too. He said constables broke down his door, tased him and sicced a K-9 on him that left bite marks on his arm.

""I can't even lift certain stuff no more,"" Gipson told us. ""My arm is still numb in certain spots. I can barely lift it up.""

CBS News

But Rosen says his officers did nothing wrong.

""We gave Mr. Gipson, before the police dog went upstairs, we told him four different times, we even yelled, 'police dog, police dog come out,'"" Rosen explained.

The Harris County constable says they have body camera video that backs up their side of the story, but they have not released it."

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/kerry-james-marshall-depicting-the-world-as-he-sees-it/,cbsnews,Kerry James Marshall: Depicting the world as he sees it,[],"Currently ""On Display"" in an exhibit that's traveling the nation: the works of an artist who wants us to view the world with new eyes. Alex Wagner is our guide:

Kerry James Marshall is changing the face of American art.

""My introduction to art history was like everybody else's,"" said Marshall. ""You see an art history book that has works by Rembrandt and Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. Yes, these things are great. But I don't see a reflection of myself in any of these things I'm looking at.""

CBS News

So for decades now, Marshall has been working on that reflection.

His figures aren't just black; they are jet black -- bold, proud, undeniably black. And he wants to fill museums with them.

""That body of work has to reach a critical mass so that it's no longer an exception to see things like that in a museum,"" he said. ""You can't have one picture of a black person or two pictures of a black person. You've got to have a lot of them.""

His trademark style has catapulted him into the stratosphere of the art world: 72 of his paintings were displayed earlier this year a New York's Metropolitan Museum.

That exhibit, a retrospective, originated in Chicago, and is now at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles.

MOCA

When asked where she thinks Marshall fits into the canon, curator Helen Molesworth replied, ""Firmly inside of it. The pictures are very much of our moment. They're of our time. And I do think that museums historically are incredibly white places.

""And so to walk into an art exhibition in which the figures are all black, it's really revelatory.""

Born 62 years ago in Birmingham, Ala., Kerry James Marshall was eight years old when the KKK bombed a Baptist church, killing four girls. He would go on to live in Los Angeles during the Watts riots, and later Harlem, and now Chicago's South Side.

""All those things had an impact on shaping the person that I am,"" he told Wagner. ""It's sort of inescapable. But those are a small fraction of the kind of experience you have on a day-to-day basis.""

His works deal with grief, injustice and loss, but also everyday life: swimming pools and beauty salons, daily rituals and quiet moments -- a window into a world often ignored in fine art.

Referencing Marshall's pictures of black domestic life, from a couple getting ready for bed, to a picnic scene, Wagner asked, ""When you paint those images, are you thinking of specific memories or people?""

""Well, I think I'm thinking in more generalized terms,"" he replied. ""But a lot of the things I'm thinking about are a reflection of experiences I had myself.""

Experiences like a visit to a barber shop, depicted in his work ""De Style"" (left).

""I think our stereotypical image of black men has been predominantly one of criminality,"" said Molesworth. ""And I think what we're being shown here is actually tenderness, stylishness, togetherness -- a brotherhood.""

Marshall's work is filled with references to both art and American history. For example, his painting ""Past Times"" calls to mind Manet's ""Luncheon on the Grass.""

""That couldn't be more correct,"" said Molesworth. ""And if you do know contemporary art, then you're going to be realizing, 'Wow, he's doing something really interesting. He's putting these moments of abstract painting in a realist picture.'""

His vision has paid off. Marshall's work has received rave reviews. He even made Time Magazine's list of the most influential people of 2017.

And his latest work seems to be exploring for new ways to depict the world as he sees it.

CBS News

Wagner said, ""We were in his studio and he's painting white figures. How meaningful is that? And what are we to read in that?""

""Well, one of the reasons I know -- in my heart, belly and mind -- that Kerry James Marshall is a great artist is because he continues to surprise me,"" said Molesworth. ""It's the first painting that has white people in it. And I don't know what it means yet. The picture isn't finished. But to me that indicates a challenge that he's set himself.""

This is an artist intent on breaking the mold -- even his own.

When asked how he keeps evolving, Marshall replied, ""Well, it has everything to do with whether you're working, because the process itself is a means of exploring. I'm interested in that.

""I've got a lot of work to do, you know?"" he laughed. ""There's a lot to do!""

Mr. Trump presented the award to Capitol Police Special Agents David Bailey and Crystal Griner as well as Alexandria Police Department Officers Nicole Battaglia, Kevin Jobe and Alexander Jensen for their bravery responding to the attacks on the congressional baseball practice.

""I can only tell you from the campaign, the people love you, they respect you and they admire you,"" Mr. Trump said of law enforcement.

On June 14, a gunman opened fire at a baseball practice in which Republican lawmakers were preparing for the annual Congressional Baseball Game for charity. The rifle shots wounded five individuals, including both Griner and Bailey as well as House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana. The assailant was taken down at the scene.

""They are American heroes and we salute them,"" Mr. Trump said of the five law enforcement officers.

Scalise was released Wednesday from MedStar Washington Hospital Center, which said the congressman has made ""excellent progress in his recovery from a life-threatening gunshot wound six weeks ago,"" according to a statement.

Scalise, who is currently recovering from his injuries, was unable to attend the ceremony, but his wife Jennifer Scalise and members of his medical team were present. The majority whip released a statement thanking and congratulating the first responders.

""Most people instinctively run from danger, but these officers did not hesitate to put their own lives on the line to run towards it that morning of June 14 to protect the lives of others,"" Scalise's statement reads.

Mr. Trump also thanked paramedics who responded to the Alexandria shooting and praised House-passed legislation aimed at assisting Capitol Police officers injured in duty.

""We are forever in your debt. Thank you God bless you, God bless our truly amazing law enforcement and God bless America,"" the president concluded."

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/raw-chicken-should-you-wash-it/,cbsnews,Does washing raw chicken make it safer to eat?,['Bianca Seidman'],"Though it may seem like good hygiene to wash chicken before cooking it, researchers at Drexel University say people have that all wrong. They've developed a campaign to try to change the misperception, called ""Don't Wash Your Chicken.""

""People are attached to the idea of washing raw poultry,"" Jennifer Quinlan, Associate Professor in the Nutrition Science Department at Drexel University, said in program materials. ""Some think they're cleaning off germs. Some just want to get slime off, or feel like it's dirty.""

Much of the chicken purchased at the supermarket, regardless of which parts or whether or not it has skin, comes with campylobacter or salmonella bacteria. Neither cold or warm water, nor fruit acids will kill those bacteria, which can sometimes cause severe cases of food-borne illness.

The way to make chicken safe to eat is to cook it thoroughly. The internal temperature of the chicken should reach 165 °F as measured with a food thermometer, according to FDA guidelines. Whether it's grilled, baked, fried or slow-cooked, it's the exposure to high heat that kills all the bacteria.

The ""Don't Wash Your Chicken"" program website says: ""If germs were visible to the naked eye, you would see that washing poultry just splashes bacteria all over you, your kitchen towels, your countertops, and any other food you have nearby, such as raw foods or salads. This can make people sick, especially young children, pregnant women, older adults and the immunocompromised.""

To illustrate the risk, a mock infrared animation of ""Germ-vision"" shows how these tiny particles of bacteria can spray far and wide when chicken is washed -- a process called aerosolization.

Quinlan said she discovered how prevalent chicken washing is through the course of her research on the quality and safety of food in minority populations, as part of a USDA-funded program. Through surveys and focus groups in the Philadelphia area, the research team found that washing chicken before cooking was common to several groups. Expanded research showed that the practice is almost universal.

The goal of the campaign is to educate people about the dangers of spreading bacteria and cross-contaminating other foods by washing chicken.

For those who want to take an extra cleaning step to remove sliminess before cooking, the FDA recommends wiping chicken with a disposable paper towel. Then be careful to wash any utensils, plates, cutting boards or kitchen counters that came in contact with raw chicken to avoid spreading the bacteria while you finish cooking."
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-mark-zuckerberg-clash-artificial-intelligence-robert-safian-fast-company/,cbsnews,Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg clash over risks of artificial intelligence,[],"Two tech billionaires are clashing over the future of artificial intelligence.

Tesla co-founder Elon Musk warned this month that AI is a ""fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization.""

""I keep sounding the alarm bell but, you know, until people see robots going down the street killing people they don't know how to react, 'cause it seems so ethereal,"" Musk said at the National Governors Association.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg criticized those comments, without referring to Musk by name, during a Facebook Live broadcast from his backyard.

""I think that people who are naysayers and kind of try to drum up these doomsday scenarios are – I don't understand it. It's really negative and in some ways I actually think it's pretty irresponsible,"" Zuckerberg said.

Musk fired back Tuesday in a tweet: ""I've talked to Mark about this. His understanding of the subject is limited.""

The editor of Fast Company magazine, Robert Safian, told ""CBS This Morning"" Wednesday, ""I think they're both right and they're both wrong.""

Safian pointed out that there are a lot of words used when referring to artificial intelligence, or the ability of computers to ""learn"" from a growing body of data to improve their accuracy over time. ""Artificial intelligence, machine learning, cognitive computing. We use different words to describe the same thing, sometimes we use the same word to describe different things. All this gets confusing in this way.""

Safian acknowledged that technological advances can make people ""anxious.""

He called Musk's concerns a ""doomsday-oriented scenario"" but also said that what the SpaceX CEO is really talking about is a need for ""more oversight and some sort of regulatory apparatus to make sure technology and AI develops in a certain way.""

The tech moguls' differing ""philosophical point of view"" also contributes to their disagreement on this issue, Safian said.

""Now, Mark Zuckerberg believes that – one of the things he loves about technology and software is you can constantly improve it. So if there's a problem we'll fix it. That's sort of Mark's approach to things,"" Safian said.

Despite their disagreement, both Musk's and Zuckerberg's businesses rely on the advancement of artificial intelligence.

""Remember Elon Musk is the guy who wants to, you know, have us live on other planets, right? And that may happen but it's a long time until that happens. What do we put in place between here and there to make sure this technology is used in an effective way. And that's really what Elon is trying to encourage us to think about,"" Safian said. ""These things always happen. In the long lens of history technology has always improved the human condition."""

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-u-s-sanctions-wont-help-to-mend-ties-russian-diplomat-says/,cbsnews,"New U.S. sanctions ""closing off the prospect for normalizing ties,"" Russian diplomat says",[],"MOSCOW -- A senior Russian diplomat said Wednesday that a new package of U.S. sanctions against Russia harms chances for improving the ties between the two countries, pushing them into ""uncharted territory,"" and that they ""defied common sense,"" CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports.

Russian officials welcomed U.S. President Donald Trump's presidential win last year, hoping to mend relations with the United States, which reached a post-Cold War low under President Barack Obama. But six months into Mr. Trump's presidency, ties between the two countries remained tense, and the much-anticipated first meeting between Mr. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin early this month did not seem to produce any tangible results.

Eager to punish Russia for meddling in the 2016 election, the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday overwhelmingly backed a new package of sanctions against Moscow that prohibits Mr. Trump from waiving the penalties without first getting permission from Congress.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov criticized the move on Wednesday as ""closing off the prospect for normalizing ties."" He said it ""defied common sense"" and told the Interfax news agency the new sanctions are pushing Russia and the U.S. ""into uncharted territory both in political and diplomatic sense.""

In a press briefing, Kremlin spokeperson Dmitry Peskov called the proposed new sanctions unfriendly, and said ""the attitude to this (law) will be formed on the basis of a thorough analysis, and the decision (on how to respond) will certainly be taken by the head of state, President Putin,"" the Reuters news agency reported.

""Right now we can say that this is rather sad news from the point of view of Russia-U.S. ties and their further development,"" Peskov continued. ""This is no less disheartening from the point of view of international law and international trade relations.... But let's now wait until it becomes a law,"" he said.

The director of the Russian International Affairs Council, Andrei Kortunov, told CBS News that Russians aren't happy about being put in the same category as Iran and North Korea.

""Basically, the signal is: You three bad guys will get the same treatment from the United States congress,"" Kortunov said. ""And with all due respect, but Russia is not North Korea.""

Another lawmaker said the only course ahead was to come up with a ""painful"" response to Washington's move, D'Agata reports.

Meanwhile, the European Union had its own concerns with the new proposed set of sanctions. On Wednesday, EU commissioners released a statement which ""expressed their concerns notably because of the draft bill's possible impact on EU energy independence,"" the AFP news agency reported.

France's foreign ministry said Wednesday that the sanctions could violate international law, Reuters reported, and Germany said it would examine the new package.

Germany and Austria in recent weeks have criticized the planned penalties, saying they could affect European businesses involved in piping Russian natural gas.

German spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer said Wednesday that Germany opposes in principle ""sanctions with extraterritorial effects."" She added it's important for the European Union and the U.S. to continue closely coordinating sanctions against Russia and ""in this light, we will examine in detail the bill that has now been approved.""

German Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Schaefer said the U.S. isn't entitled to tell European companies how to do business with a third country, but the legislation has improved from the original proposal."
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/scaramucci-priebus-a-white-house-at-war-with-itself/,cbsnews,Scaramucci vs. Priebus: A White House at war with itself,['Kathryn Watson'],"If it wasn't already apparent a war is brewing between new White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci and chief of staff Reince Priebus, Scaramucci has now made that clear.

Scaramucci -- who has threatened to fire his entire communications staff in reaction to White House leaks -- all but accused Priebus of being a leaker in a tweet he posted then deleted late Wednesday night, after Politico reported Scaramucci's financial disclosure information.

""In light of the leak of my financial info which is a felony. I will be contacting @FBI and the @TheJusticeDept #swamp @Reince45,"" the now-deleted tweet read.

Scaramucci didn't end the tough talk there. On CNN's ""New Day"" Thursday, he again targeted Priebus in relation to leaks.

""When I put out a tweet and I put Reince's name in a tweet, they're all making the assumption that it's him because journalists know who the leakers are,"" Scaramucci said on CNN Thursday. ""So if Reince wants to explain he's not a leaker, let him do that. But let me tell you about myself. I'm a straight shooter and I'll go right to the heart of the matter.""

Hours later, incoming press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders coaxed the concept of the rivalry between the two in the press briefing room.

""I think the president as always enjoys healthy competition and conversation and he sees that as such,"" Sanders said.

Scaramucci exploded onto the White House scene last week, making it clear in his first press briefing he would not only be taking over the communications reins from outgoing press secretary and Priebus ally Sean Spicer, but that he would also have the access and powers normally designated to the chief of staff. He said he reports directly to the president, instead of to Priebus, and wields the authority to fire people.

At the same time, Priebus' presence has seemed to diminish in the White House. But the distance between the two represents more than just ""healthy competition,"" as Sanders coined it.

Priebus, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, represents the establishment Republican wing brought on in efforts to provide Washington know-how to a president with no experience holding public office. Other RNC allies brought aboard included Spicer and Kate Walsh, former deputy White House chief of staff. They're now gone.

Scaramucci has indicated his allegiance is to the president alone, and he's willing to go to bat for him. Like Mr. Trump, he's a New Yorker. Like Mr. Trump, his past political views don't reflect typical Republican party positions, but Scaramucci said his ideas have since ""evolved."""
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/climate-diaries-drought-threatening-african-mountain-gorillas/,cbsnews,Climate Diaries: Drought threatening African mountain gorillas,['Mark Phillips'],"VOLCANO NATIONAL PARK, Rwanda -- There’s a population on the slopes of these volcanic peaks in central Africa that knows nothing of arguments in Washington about climate change.

But the famous “gorillas in the mist” do know something is going on.

They know the bamboo shoots that make up a major part of their diet, and which used to sprout like clockwork, are now less predictable.

CBS News

The rains that produce them were a month late this year. The gorillas have had to adapt their roaming and foraging patterns because the old seasonal rhythms of food production have altered. Their world is changing.

The gorillas’ problems are made worse by the troubles of their distant cousins and close neighbors: people.

Since the late rains have also made the water supply down in the valleys less reliable, local villagers have been going up into gorilla country, where they’re not supposed to go, to bring that good mountain water home.

And park ranger Abel Musana says water isn’t the only thing the people are after during the drought.

“The harvest will be impacted and the people are coming to invade the habitat, which is for gorillas,” Musana said.

When the people are low on food, they go into the park looking for it.

The human population has ballooned in the areas surrounding the park. According to David Greer of the World Wildlife Fund’s great apes program, when those people are forced up into the mountains they bring disease and other dangers with them.

“They have to enter the park to access this clean water. And in the meantime they might want to set a snare for catching an ungulate for food,” Greer said, referring to a class of mammals that includes antelopes and other local fauna.

But on some occasions, a gorilla can become ensnared in those same traps.

That’s what happened to one gorilla, filmed by a “60 Minutes” team a few months ago. The snare was removed by one of the vets whose work has actually helped the ape population increase lately.

Still, there are only about 880 mountain gorillas left in the world, confined to the mountain tops across Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda. They’re already considered critically endangered. And as their world changes, they have nowhere to go."

Members of Congress are getting positive ratings for the way they responded to the shooting in Alexandria, Virginia, last week. President Trump gets slightly lower -- though still net positive -- evaluations for his response to the attack, partly because Democrats are less likely to approve of his handling than of Congress'. Fifty-three percent of Americans approved of Congress' response, and 29 percent disapproved, while 46 percent approved of President Trump's response, and 36 percent disapproved.

CBS News

And while Congress and many observers called for a more civil tone to political debate in the wake of the events, Americans of all political leanings overwhelmingly say that the tone and level of civility in our political debates has been getting worse in recent years.

CBS News

These views are largely the same across ideologies, too, as about two-thirds of liberals, conservatives and even more moderates feel things have gotten worse.

Three-quarters of Americans feel the current tone of politics and debate is encouraging violence among some people; Democrats are especially likely to say so. About a third of Americans consider the recent shooting of a Congressman and others a terrorist attack.

CBS News

But importantly, Americans draw some distinctions between the political debate they decry, and the people themselves that hold opposing views. Most Republicans do not think of Democrats as threats to their way of life, but merely as people they disagree with on politics. Likewise, most Democrats feel the same about Republicans in this regard. There is a small core in each party, who do see other Americans across the political divide as threats to their way of life -- but they are not the majority.

CBS News

Given this, optimism still prevails, though not by a landslide. More believe that people of different political views are capable of working together than are pessimistic about the prospects.

This poll was conducted by telephone June 15-18, 2017 among a random sample of 1,117 adults nationwide. Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Media, PA. Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones.

The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone.

Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables.

The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus four percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly.

But President Trump's business organization wants to stay on the down low.

CBS News has obtained a new confidentiality agreement rolled out after the election. The Trump Organization is requiring employees at all levels to sign it, or else they will lose their jobs.

Employees must agree to keep secret any information they learn about anyone in the ""Trump family"" and extended family, including their ""present, former and future spouses, children, parents, in-laws.""

""I have reviewed confidentiality agreements in international, family-run hospitality organizations and... I have never seen a loyalty code to a family like this,"" said Debra Soltis, who has specialized in employment law for more than 25 years.

CBS News

""This confidentiality agreement looks more like what you would expect to sign if you were a nanny to Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's children, where you were being brought into the home and exposed to private information,"" she said.

Specifically off limits: ""all political, legal, social, religious, health-related affairs, activities, views and/or opinions of any member of the Trump family... all photographs, movies, sketches, videos, sound or image recordings or likenesses of any member of the Trump family.""

The agreement lasts forever and is retroactive.

Soltis says the agreement could discourage would-be whistleblowers. Because even though the company code of conduct requires employees to be truthful in any government inquiry, the confidentiality agreement has a clause saying if an employee is required by law to disclose confidential information, they have to notify the Trump Organization.

""What if an employee had information that was relevant and the public had every right to know? Under this agreement they could not share it. They couldn't raise their hand and say 'I know something, I've seen something.' And that is deeply troubling,"" she said.

In a statement, the Trump Organization told CBS News it has used confidentiality agreements for many years.

""This is no different than any other company in the hospitality industry and beyond,"" a spokesperson said. ""To suggest otherwise is not only disingenuous but downright absurd."""

In his Oscar-nominated role in ""The Caine Mutiny"" (1954), Humphrey Bogart made us believe he was crazy. His Captain Queeg is the skipper of a World War II minesweeper … and a study in paranoia:

Of course it's only a movie, but you may not know that it's drawn from real life.

The man who wrote ""The Caine Mutiny,"" Herman Wouk, was once a naval officer himself. And he served for two years aboard a minesweeper called the Zane.

Doubleday

Now, at a rather reclusive 102 years old, he agreed to discuss it.

""People who read 'The Caine Mutiny' today might be surprised that it's actually based on truth,"" said Smith. ""And was there a Captain Queeg?""

""Yes, there was a Captain Queeg,"" replied Wouk. ""More than one actually. But he was unique in his way. He wasn't Humphrey Bogart. But he was a work of imagination drawn out of a real experience.""

Talk about real experience: Wouk is a giant of American literature. ""The Caine Mutiny"" was only his first big success.

Wouk grew up in the Bronx, and after graduating Columbia University, found work writing for comedian Fred Allen's radio show.

""Did you at some point say, 'Okay, I need to stop writing comedy, and I need to do something more serious'?"" Smith asked.

""Not in quite that way. But I was very tired of the joke writing. I felt there was more to do, but I really didn't know what to do beside that.""

He wound up joining the Navy at the start of World War II. For gagwriter Wouk, it was a game-changer.

""I found my feet as a writer in the Navy,"" he said. ""I was no longer trying to be funny or anything. I just reported the facts. That's what the Navy gave me. Cheers to the Navy!""

But if Wouk's two years at sea helped make his writing career, it was a night ashore that transformed his life.

He met Sarah at her birthday party, which he crashed.

Herman and Sarah were married in 1945, and in time she became his literary agent.

Smith asked, ""What role did Sarah play in your writing?""

""It's just impossible to exaggerate there,"" Wouk said, pointing to her portrait. ""There she sits looking at me, says, 'Don't mention me.' She says, 'You know, it's not important.'""

""But she was important?""

""Oh, she was the key!""

CBS News

In 1951, with her encouragement, he published ""The Caine Mutiny."" It won him a Pulitzer Prize, and helped make him a celebrity.

But for all of its success, Wouk says ""The Caine Mutiny"" was only a start.

Smith asked, ""Was there a moment when you knew, Wow, this is big?""

""Now without sounding conceited, I never thought of it as my big, big book,"" Wouk replied. ""I knew that there was much more to do. I really did.""

In Wouk's mind, the World War II books and movies up to that time were missing something -- so he started what he called ""the main task.""

Which was? ""To, so far as I could, fix down in literature what happened in World War II and the Holocaust. That was my main task.""

Back Bay Books

The result was a pair of novels for the ages: the first, ""The Winds of War,"" published in 1971, set on the eve of World War II.

""Did it meet your expectations?"" Smith asked.

""Yes. It could have been better, deeper. But it told a story.""

The book was a big bestseller, and, you may recall, it became a very big TV mini-series.

Seven years later, he finished the story with ""War and Remembrance."" The made-for-TV movie that followed broke new ground for prime time TV. The death camp scenes were actually filmed at Auschwitz, with no horrific detail spared.

""I was never interested in writing a history; I wanted to write a book about the war,"" Wouk said.

""But at the same time, you're teaching people history.""

""Doggone right I am! That's the main task.""

The Wouks moved to Palm Springs in the California desert in 1990: The boy from New York City said it was his wife's idea, but added, ""I love it here.""

Sarah passed away in 2011, but she's still an important presence in his life.

""She believed in you,"" said Smith.

Simon & Schuster

""Yes. More than that; she believed in me more than I did in myself at the time!""

""But you didn't want to get married at first? She had to kind of convince you?""

""I'll say no more about Sarah,"" said Wouk.

""No more?""

""No more.""

He says his latest book, ""Sailor and Fiddler"" (Simon & Schuster), a glance back at a remarkable life, will be his last.

Herman Wouk is a genius at telling stories; he just doesn't seem to care much for sharing his own.

Smith said, ""I have a feeling you're not going to answer, but I'll ask you anyway: Have you stopped writing?""

""Have I stopped writing? Well, I always keep my diary.""

""And beyond that?""

""Beyond that, go find yourself another interview!"" Wouk laughed.

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-movie-detroit-director-kathryn-bigelow-actor-anthony-mackie/,cbsnews,"Director Kathryn Bigelow, actor Anthony Mackie on the relevance of new film ""Detroit""",['Jessica Kegu'],"""Detroit"" has been described as ""tense, excruciating and entirely necessary."" The new film by Academy Award-winning director Kathryn Bigelow is set during the civil unrest that erupted 50 years ago following the police raid of an unlicensed bar in a black Detroit neighborhood.

The violence was in response to police brutality and decades of racial inequality. Five days of conflict resulted in more than 40 deaths and more than 2,000 damaged or destroyed buildings.

""Detroit"" centers on a real-life incident at the Algiers Motel where police terrorized guests in a confrontation that ended with the deaths of three unarmed black teens at the hands of white police officers.

Bigelow said on ""CBS This Morning"" Friday that she wanted to tell this story primarily because of its relevance to today.

""When I was first introduced to it, it was right around the time of Ferguson, Missouri, and I'm thinking, this is 50 years ago today and yet it's happening today, it's happening tomorrow. It's recurring far too often and I hope, perhaps, it could invite a dialogue to encourage a bridge between an incredible racial divide in this country,"" Bigelow said.

""Detroit"" is a reunion for Bigelow and actor Anthony Mackie who worked together on the 2006 movie ""The Hurt Locker."" Mackie, who portrays a real-life survivor of the incident, also joined ""CBS This Morning"" to discuss the film.

""Being a parent of little boys, you know, you try to do work that they can watch and relate and learn from. And when I read this script and read Greene, and that character specifically I knew Kathryn would give me that opportunity,"" Mackie said.

Bigelow said a combination of court records, testimonies, Freedom of Information Act requests and research was used to piece together the characters and historical context of the story.

""We also met with real-life people who were involved in this incident,"" Bigelow said. The person who inspired the character, Julie, joined Bigelow on set every day, the director said. ""Hearing their rendition of this situation and the horror that they went through really galvanized my determination to tell the story.""

Asked if they thought the Detroit riots could happen today, the two paused and looked at one another before Bigelow said, ""It seems all far too likely in many respects.""

Rep. John Conyers of Michigan hosted a screening of the film on Capitol Hill and is also portrayed in the film. Conyers is renewing a call to end racial profiling with proposed legislation. ""Hopefully this film could encourage that conversation,"" Bigelow said.

Mackie's character is a military veteran and one of the people trapped in the Algiers Motel. Though the two never met, Mackie said, ""I think it says a lot about his character and dignity that he was the first person to speak out about this tragedy.""

Mackie added: ""We are right now in that decade of turmoil and combustion. I feel like America every 50 years goes through a resurgence – a growth. And from that growth the country transforms dramatically and right now we're in that pressure cooker that all we need to do is add a match and it'll explode.""

But for Mackie the most important message of the movie is simply, ""survival.""

""Detroit"" opens in select cities Friday and nationwide on August 4."
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/financial-game-changers-budgeting-pregnancy-or-a-job-loss/,cbsnews,Financial game-changers: Budgeting for the unexpected,['Jillian Harding'],"Life can upend even the most carefully crafted financial plans. A surprise pregnancy or unexpected job loss, for instance, could mean putting retirement goals on hold to account for changing circumstance and priorities.

When you get thrown a curve ball, here are a few things to keep in mind to keep your retirement plan on track:

Expect the unexpected

Most financial experts recommend keeping an emergency fund that covers three to six months of expenses. Make that a full year's worth of expenses if you are self-employed or your income is prone to fluctuate.

Concerned because you don't have an emergency fund? You aren't alone: 69 percent Americans have less than $1,000 saved for a rainy day, according to a GoBankingRates survey. That's a risky place to be -- one wrong move and you could be backed into a corner with nowhere to go but a high-interest personal loan or credit card. Make a plan: There are many savings accounts with low minimum balance requirements that can help you start socking away some cash. Although the yield on many of these accounts may be low, over time that money adds up as interest is earned.

""We can all get through a major event, and we can thank the credit card industry for that,"" financial adviser Devon Klumb told CBS MoneyWatch. ""But many people do not do a good job of paying the card right away -- and if you tack 17 to 25 percent interest on a credit card [balance], people get into trouble.""

Baby on the way

Having a baby is a huge physical, emotional -- and financial -- event. The first year of a child's life, including daycare, can cost a middle-class family up to $21,000.

What can you do to minimize those costs while making the right long-term decisions for your growing family?

Do as much as you can to prepare ahead of time. Within a general timeframe of nine months, you have time to research changes to health insurance and daycare costs; also do the math on the price of daily essentials, and reach out to your support network.

There are lots of ways to cut costs. Julia Wang, digital content head at the maternity website The Bump, said people tend to overspend on items such as clothing, toys and fancy crib bedding -- much of which will be used for a very short period of time, if at all.

""Clothes have such a low return on investment -- babies grow so quickly, you'll never recoup the cost of the clothing. If you can get a hand-me-down, take advantage of it,"" she said.

Instead, purchase big-ticket items ahead of time and stock up on essentials like diapers or wipes. Start paying attention to costs of diapers and formula -- buy them now, before the baby comes, and have family and friends be on the lookout for bargains.

Another important thing to consider: maternity and paternity leave, and childcare. See if you qualify for the Family Medical Leave Act and make sure you understand your employer's maternity and paternity leave policies. Depending on your state of residence, you may have more generous leave policies, in addition to support like nursing coaches or other assistance once your child is born.

Who will care for your child on a daily basis, and what that will do to your budget? More than a third of U.S. families spend 20 percent or more of their annual income on childcare, according to a Care.com parent survey. Deciding whether outside care is right for you means carefully considering your options.

""Some people decide that mom (or dad) is done working,"" financial adviser Matthew Seppanen said. ""It's shocking how easy it is to prioritize spending when you are bringing someone into the world. Everything goes out the window.""

Especially for the first year, when a new budget is being implemented, it's okay to take a breather from retirement contributions -- as long as you factor in the changes and begin contributing again as soon as possible.

Out of a job

In the event of a sudden job loss, the most important thing to do is prioritize necessary spending. Focus on keeping the lights on, paying rent, paying your health insurance bills and getting your next job. Make sure you account for any severance your ex-employer might owe you and file for unemployment benefits if you are eligible.

It's OK if your retirement contributions are put on hold during this time period. Most experts say you should even wait to decide what to do with any existing retirement funds until you move to your next job.

""It's such a traumatic event,"" financial adviser Sanjay Jain said. ""Once you settle in your next job, then you can take care of it.""

While you may be tempted to immediately roll over any existing retirement funds into an IRA plan, many experts suggest waiting until you know where you will land. If you have a 401(k) at your former employer, your next company may use the same provider, allowing you to easily move that money over to the new plan. Immediately transferring the money to an IRA when you lose a job means you won't be able to consolidate your savings, if it's allowed at your new job.

Keeping your health insurance while unemployed is another essential. If you lose your employer-sponsored coverage, you may qualify to continue benefits with COBRA, including in cases of voluntary or involuntary job loss, a drop in work hours, and other life events. This will generally allow you to keep your current health insurance for up to a year, though you will need to pay the full premium each month. Although the monthly costs of carrying COBRA can be high, the financial risks of being uninsured are arguably higher.

""You don't want to go through a catastrophic event while you are unemployed,"" Jain said.

There is a 60-day period after you lose employer sponsored health care coverage to enroll in COBRA, which you can use to determine whether this is the best coverage option.

You could also buy an individual insurance plan under the Affordable Care Act. A job loss is a qualifying event, allowing you to purchase a policy at any time, and if your income drops you could qualify for a subsidy. (President Trump has made it his goal to repeal the law, but until then it is in effect.) If your income drops significantly, you might even be eligible for Medicaid.

Don't panic

Most important, don't panic. Examine your budget: Where can you cut back on spending? Is there a way to add income, even if it's a short-term ""side hustle""? Although your financial goals may take longer to reach, often there are ways to supplement savings and rebuild your finances.

""Overall, it is best to run several scenarios and see if it is possible to 'give a little' from several corners of your financial life – a little from the monthly budget, a slightly cheaper vacation this year, a little less in education savings, a slightly reduced contribution to retirement account, etc,"" financial adviser David Metzger told CBS MoneyWatch. ""It definitely doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing proposition. Then when the reality of the new life event has settled in, we can begin making adjustment back in the direction from which we came."""

But living in these homes on wheels isn't exactly roughing it. Taking cues from the glamorous camping (or ""glamping"") and micro-housing trends that have also gained popularity over the past few years, these vehicles often feature creature comforts found in stationary houses -- like refrigerators, toilets and gas stovetops. They also sport inviting décor that would make any aspirational Instagrammer jealous.

Some van owners utilize the tiny abodes for temporary trips, but others have used them as full-time starter homes that help reduce living expenses and allow for flexible career paths.

Freedom from traditional housing payments makes it financially possible for many of these travelers to explore, ditch the cubicle and get in touch with the natural world. But there can be significant upfront costs.

The good news for van-life hopefuls is that it's easy to prioritize and select vehicles, custom features and finishes to fit almost every individual budget and lifestyle. Van conversion projects can cost anywhere from $16,000 to $65,000 and can take years to finish, depending on how ""DIY"" owners choose to go.

These homeowners often find large communities on social media platforms like Instagram, where many have thousands of followers and learn from each other's experiences. They share images, stories and advice using hashtags like #homeiswhereyouparkit, #exploremore and, of course, #vanlife.

Some of the most popular van lifers secure sponsorships from food or outdoor lifestyle brands, thanks to their large social media followings, but most simply enjoy sharing their passion with others.

""The crazy thing about all this is that Instagram has been a huge driver for everything,"" said van-home owner Mike Shisler. ""The whole van-life community lives on Instagram. Years ago, that's how we found another couple living in a van that inspired us to do it.""

But these communities don't always stay online. Van lifers can also be found flocking together at campgrounds, and there are even outdoor festivals that incorporate van-life villages.

Jude Sparks said he literally fell on the 1.2-million-year-old skull of a stegomastodon -- a massive prehistoric creature with tusks like an elephant -- while on a hike with his parents on the desert outskirts of his neighborhood in Las Cruces, New Mexico.

""I was running farther up and I tripped on part of the tusk,"" Sparks said in a statement from New Mexico State University, where researchers are studying the find. ""My face landed next to the bottom jaw. I looked farther up and there was another tusk.""

The stegomastodon is one of three species of proboscideans that inhabited the ancient Rio Grande Valley, and is believed to be an ancestor to modern-day elephants.

New Mexico State University

Sparks' parents contacted biologist Peter Houde, a professor at New Mexico State University, after hearing he had discovered a similar fossil in a quarry south of campus, the university said.

The fossil was found on private land, and it took several months to get permission to excavate from the property owner. In New Mexico, the law stipulates that vertebrate fossils found on private land belong to the landowner. Here, the property owner asked that the precise site remain confidential, according to the university.

The Sparks family eventually joined with Houde and his students to excavate the skull, a process that took one week.

The large skull is deceptively delicate, and the only thing holding it together was the sediment around it, Houde said.

NMSU/Andres Leighton

""When the sediments are removed from the sides of [the bones], they start to fall apart immediately and literally fall into tiny, tiny bits. It has to be done carefully by somebody who knows how to go about doing it. It is a very deliberate process that takes a little bit of time,"" he said.

The team applied chemical hardeners to the fossil, mimicking the bone strength provided by protein, to keep it intact. Once dug from the ground, the fossil was coated in plaster and supported by wood braces for transport to New Mexico State University's Vertebrate Museum, where it now lives.

""We have the unique opportunity to really compare what the animal looks like [on] a much larger complete scale and compare it with others,"" Houde told CBS Albuquerque affiliate KRQE, adding that it's extremely rare to find a nearly intact skull of a mammal dating back to the Ice Age.

The process to reconstruct the skull, jaw and tusks is likely to take years to complete, Houde said.

""I have every hope and expectation that this specimen will ultimately end up on exhibit and this little boy will be able to show his friends and even his own children, look what I found right here in Las Cruces,"" he said."

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cell-phone-spam-and-scam-calls-are-spreading/,cbsnews,Spam and scam calls are going mobile,['Kathy Kristof'],"Cell phones used to be immune from the annoying scam and spam telemarketing robocalls that have bedeviled land line users for years. No longer.

More than half of cell phone users report having received a scam call in the past month. And repeated scam and spam calls to mobile phones have quadrupled over the past two years, according to a new survey.

Several factors can explain the increase, said Jonathan Sasse, chief marketing officer of First Orion Network Enterprise Solutions, which commissioned the study. More people are using their cell phones as a primary form of contact, thus sharing the numbers on everything from rent applications and resumes to website forms and contests. Some consumers also include their cell phone numbers in email signature lines.

""Once a mobile number is out there, scammers and telemarketers will find a way to call you,"" Sasse added. ""When it comes to scammers, these aren't legitimate companies following the rules. They're after your mobile number however they can get it, even if it means using auto-dialers to try any possible combination of phone numbers to target people.""

Moreover, the cost of random-dialing equipment has dropped ""to practically nothing,"" said John Oldshue, chief executive of SaveOnPhone, a cell phone shopping website. That's allowing offshore telemarketing ""boiler room"" operations to proliferate.

Roughly 80 million unwanted calls are made to cell phones each day. First Orion's latest survey, which polled 1,000 mobile phone users, found that over three-quarters of respondents received a scam call in the past year, a 15 percent increase from the company's previous survey in 2015.

However, 12 percent of consumers reported getting 20 scam calls or more in just the past six months -- a four-fold increase over the 3 percent who reported repeated scam calls in the previous survey.

Unfortunately, old-school solutions to junk calls, such as signing up for the Do Not Call Registry, are ineffective at handling the preponderance of today's scam and spam calling.

""The Do Not Call Registry is only effective in stopping legitimate telemarketers from calling you,"" said Oldshue. ""These guys set up calling centers in Bangladesh. They're not playing by the rules.""

That said, a wealth of services are available that can block the bulk of these calls. Though many charge annual or monthly fees, some caller-ID and blocking services are free. Hiya, for instance, offers a free phone app that provides caller ID and call blocking. Nomorobo provides the same free service for land lines."

It has been dubbed, appropriately enough, the ""Great American Eclipse.""

""It really is fortunate,"" said Matthew Penn, an astronomer with the National Optical Astronomy Observatory who is leading a nationwide effort to photograph the eclipse from 68 sites along the path of totality.

NASA

""The U.S. only covers 2 percent of the globe, so we get very few eclipses,"" he said. ""And to have one travel across the entire country is an unprecedented sort of opportunity. It'll be a heck of day. The best thing is, it can't be cloudy everywhere!""

The first inklings of what's to come will be visible from the Oregon coast, weather permitting, around 9:05 a.m. local time (12:05 p.m. EDT) when viewers with safety filters, from inexpensive cardboard ""solar glasses"" to more sophisticated aids, will see the moon begin to take a bite out of the sun, the start of a partial solar eclipse.

A partial eclipse will be visible across the entire United States, including Alaska and Hawaii, Canada, Central America and northern South America, with more than half of the sun obscured for residents across the lower 48 states.

But for millions of viewers who make their way into the narrow path of totality, a partial eclipse, a thrilling sight in its own right, will serve as an appetizer for the main course, the all-too-fleeting moments when the moon completely blocks out the sun.

Michael Zeiler, www.GreatAmericanEclipse.com

Moving across the Pacific Ocean at more than 2,400 mph, the dark inner heart of the moon's shadow -- the umbra -- will move ashore near Lincoln Beach, Ore., at 10:16 a.m. local time (1:16 p.m. EDT), and then sweep across 14 states and 20 national parks over the next hour and a half.

More than 200 million people live within a day's drive of the path of totality, potentially turning the Great American Eclipse into one of the most heavily viewed and shared events in recent memory.

""The Great American Eclipse on Aug. 21 is such an exciting event, it is a really singular and unique event in human history, really, where in the 21st century we have this amazing technology with social media,"" said Carrie Black, associate program director of the National Science Foundation's Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences.

""And it's happening across the United States, so the entire country can participate,"" she said. ""There's never been an event like this in human history where so many people could participate and with such unique technology.""

When the eclipse arrives

Two minutes and 145 miles after the leading edge of the moon's shadow crosses the coast of Oregon, a partial eclipse will begin in the small town of Madras at 9:07 a.m. local time (12:07 p.m. EDT). With clear skies the rule this time of year, thousands of tourists and astronomers, both amateur and professional, are expected to join 6,400 area residents to take in the show.

One hour and 12 minutes after the start of the partial eclipse, at 10:19 a.m., the moon will completely block out the sun above Madras, turning a bright morning into deep twilight for the next two minutes and two seconds.

The temperature will drop, bright stars like Regulus will appear and the sun's super-heated corona will shimmer into view like a halo around the unseen moon. The light coming in from around the horizon, from beyond the edge of the moon's shadow, will appear in pinkish-orange hues like a 360-degree sunset.

""It's not as dark as night, for the most part,"" said Rick Fienberg a spokesman for the American Astronomical Society who holds a doctorate in astronomy. ""This one, the shadow's only about 70 miles wide. So 35 miles away from you, in every direction, it's light. The sky during a total solar eclipse is not black, it's blue.""

But the star of the show, so to speak, is the sun's corona, a magnetically energized region above the sun's visible surface -- the photosphere -- where the temperature suddenly -- and inexplicably -- climbs from about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit to nearly 4 million degrees.

Rick Fienberg / TravelQuest International / Wilderness Travel

The solar wind, a torrent of electrically charged particles, is accelerated to enormous velocities in the corona, spewing into space in all directions and reaching the farthest corners of the solar system. What drives the corona's extreme temperatures and accelerates the solar wind is a mystery, in part because the region is so difficult to study.

The inner regions of the corona can only be studied during a total solar eclipse when the moon completely blocks the sun's glare. Satellite instruments and ground-based telescopes create their own artificial eclipses, inserting a circular sun shade into a camera's light path that acts like a miniature moon.

But to keep from blinding sensitive detectors, such coronagraphs must block the sun's light out to more than a solar diameter. During a total solar eclipse, the actual moon does a much better job, revealing the corona's mysterious innermost regions.

""What's particularly special about a natural eclipse is that the moon is a perfect occulter, it blocks the surface of the sun just perfectly so you can see very low into the solar atmosphere,"" Black said. ""Scientists are particularly interested in the low corona, because that's where lots of activity is, that's where the origins of space weather are.""

With the Aug. 21 eclipse's coast-to-coast track across America, astronomers and citizen scientists will have a golden opportunity to learn more about the processes at work in the corona as millions along the path of totality get a chance to witness the sun's fiery halo.

NASA

""What you see is the jet black silhouette of the moon framed by the beautiful white of the corona, streaming out in all directions, usually several diameters of the sun away,"" Fienberg said. ""What makes it especially wonderful is the quality of the light, and the fact that the corona behaves like iron filings around a bar magnet, it traces the sun's magnetic field. So you see loops and streamers ... and it's just spectacular.

""And the light, the quality of the light is very unusual, too,"" he added. ""You're looking at glowing ionized gas, which is like what's in a fluorescent bulb or something, it's a mix of that and a mix of sunlight reflected off electrons and sunlight reflected off dust in the solar system, so it's a very different kind of light than ordinary daylight.""

Unlike the partial phases of a solar eclipse, when even a sliver of sunlight can cause eye damage if viewed for extended periods or any sort of optical aid, the fully eclipsed sun is safe to look at during the few minutes the moon completely covers the sun's disk.

Jay M. Pasachoff

""The total amount of light coming from the eclipsed sun, that's about as much light as comes from a full moon,"" Fienberg said. ""That's why we keep telling people, it's perfectly safe to look at the totally eclipsed sun. Once every last part of the sun's bright everyday face is covered, what's left, the corona, is about as bright as the full moon. So it's no more dangerous to look at.""

Fienberg will be in Madras with a tour group, his 13th trip to witness a total solar eclipse. His advice to first-time eclipse watchers: don't worry about telescopes or sophisticated optics. Just take in one of nature's grandest shows with the unaided eye.

""If you just look at it with a telescope, you're going to see the solar corona and you're going to see all kinds of interesting loops and streamers and things, but you're going to miss the broader effect. You might not see the sunset colors around the horizon, you might not realize how blue the sky is because in the telescope it'll just look black,"" he said.

""You won't see bright stars and planets that come out around the sun because they're going to be outside the field of view of the telescope. I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to alternate between using low-power binoculars and my naked eye.""

The view in binoculars is ""really breathtaking,"" he said, ""because you see a lot more detail in the corona, but you also see it in context, you see the whole sun and the whole corona and you get the bluish sky in the background.""

While it might seem contrary to countless warnings, using binoculars during totality, when the sun's light is completely blocked, is not dangerous in and of itself. And the observer will see clear signs totality is ending in plenty of time to look away and switch back to a filtered view.

But aside from the few minutes of totality, one should never look at the sun directly, experts warn, with or without optical aid, even during a nearly full partial eclipse, without using an internationally certified filter designed to reduce the sun's glare to a safe level.

""There's probably going to be an uptick in eye injuries no matter how much you tell people and how easy it is to get your hands on solar filters,"" Fienberg said. ""There are always people who will either ignore the messaging or just take unnecessary risks. But ... it's really hard to hurt yourself by looking at the sun too long. It's very uncomfortable.""

Cross-country path of eclipse

From Madras, the moon's shadow will race across Oregon and into Idaho, passing just north of Boise before moving on across Idaho Falls at 11:33 a.m. local time (1:33 p.m. EDT), Casper, Wyoming, at 11:42 a.m. (1:42 p.m. EDT), Grand Island, Nebraska, at 12:58 p.m. (1:58 p.m. EDT), St. Joseph, Missouri, at 1:06 p.m. (2:06 p.m. EDT) and nearby Columbia six minutes later. By this point, the shadow will have slowed to about 1,500 mph.

Residents of the northeast corner of Kansas City, just inside the path of totality, will enjoy about a minute of darkness around 1:08 p.m. (2:08 p.m. EDT) as will residents in southwestern St. Louis a few minutes after that.

Crossing the Mississippi River, the center of the moon's shadow will pass just south of Carbondale, Illinois, at 1:20 p.m. (2:20 p.m. EDT) before moving over Paducah and Hopkinsville, Kentucky, at 1:24 p.m. (2:24 p.m. EDT).

Along this stretch, eclipse watchers will enjoy the maximum duration of the eclipse, about two minutes and 40 seconds of totality.

From Kentucky, the shadow will move across Clarksville and then Nashville, Tennessee, the largest city in the path of totality, at 1:27 p.m. (2:27 p.m. EDT) crossing over the Smokey Mountains, the southwest corner of North Carolina and then racing over the heart of South Carolina where viewers in Greenville, Columbia, Charleston will enjoy totality between 2:38 p.m. and 2:47 p.m. EDT

The moon's shadow then will move off shore and out over the Atlantic Ocean, one hour and 33 minutes after the umbra crossed the coast of Oregon some 2,500 miles away.

Given its coast-to-coast track through the heartland of the United States, many observers believe the 2017 eclipse will be one of the most viewed in history and certainly the most scientifically studied.

""The other reason this is going to be so well observed is because we now live in a social media era,"" Fienberg said. ""Before, there were no smartphones, there was no Facebook, there was no Twitter. You have to literally be locked in an underground bunker to not be able to find out what's going on outside.

""So, everybody's going to hear about this, one way or another, and with any luck, they're going to get excited. ... Even if they don't make it into the path of totality, a deep partial eclipse, observed safely, can be fun.""

Williams College astronomer Jay Pasachoff, author of an article outlining planned eclipse research in the August issue of Scientific American magazine, plans to observe his 66th solar eclipse from the campus of Willamette University in Salem, Ore., along with an international team of researchers and a battery of telescopes, cameras and spectrographs.

""We've done preliminary versions of this before, but things get refined, the theoretical models get refined and the instruments get better,"" he said in an interview. ""We only have about two minutes, so you do the measurements you can. Each time we have an eclipse, the loops of gas, the shape of the corona, the magnetic field is different. So you want to take those couple of minutes whenever you can and find out what's going on there.""

Pasachoff team is one of scores that will be stationed along -- and above -- the path of totality. At least 11 NASA spacecraft will train their instruments on the sun, more than 50 high-altitude balloons will take photographs and study the effects of the eclipse on Earth's atmosphere, along with aircraft carrying a variety of instruments.

Hundreds of ground-based observatories will swing into action with numerous focused teams of researchers spread out along the path of totality. Veteran eclipse astronomer Shadia Habbal of the University of Hawaii will lead five such teams that, like Pasachoff's, will be studying the inner corona.

Penn is leading a team made up of more than 200 volunteers using identical telescopes, cameras and computers at 68 locations along the path of totality.

The goal of Penn's Citizen CATE (Continental-America Telescopic Eclipse) project is to assemble a carefully calibrated movie of the eclipse to learn more about how the sun's magnetic field accelerates particles in the corona. Data will be collected using identical telescopes, cameras and computers operated by volunteers, including students and astronomy club members.

""The thing that excites me the most about this eclipse is that millions of people across the country, in the path of totality, can walk out on their porch in their slippers and collect world-class data,"" Penn said. ""They won't have to travel to a large telescope on top of a mountain, you can go into your backyard using fairly modest-size instruments and collect really important research data.""

A more public project, the Eclipse Megamovie, is led by Hugh Hudson, a solar physicist at the University of California at Berkeley. His team is soliciting imagery from volunteers ""as an outreach thing,"" he said, ""and make a big movie that incorporates all the images.""

""It will be complicated, but in principle you can ... create an actual movie,"" he said. ""That's never been done before as far as I can tell, and this is a wonderful opportunity for us.""

In an interview, Pasachoff advised the public to take in the partial phases of the eclipse with low-cost solar filters. For viewers in the path of totality, ""just keep looking through them and when that presence diminishes and becomes invisible through the glasses you put the glasses down and watch for a couple of minutes.""

""If you want to look up in those two minutes, which is between two minutes on the Oregon coast on the central line and two minutes 40 seconds in Illinois, then you can glance with binoculars for a few seconds to see some of the detail in the corona. But it's also nice to look around the sky and see what stars and planets you can see and look at that sunset effect on the horizon all around you.""

The shape of the corona changes during the sun's 11-year sunspot cycle as the number of spots wax and wane. The sun currently is moving into the minimum phase of the cycle ""and that means that the corona will be very extended at the sun's equator and it won't hide the plumes of hot gas, the million-degree-gas, that's coming out of the poles,"" Pasachoff said.

""So we'll have an opportunity to study this gas at the poles for the first time in about eight or 10 years.""

For eclipse novices taking in their first total solar eclipse, Pasachoff said astronomers will ""be glad to give you our pictures.""

""Don't cut into your enjoyment by being too busy with your camera, just watch,"" he said, echoing Fienberg's advice.

Does the view ever get old?

""No, it gets better and better,"" he said.

Will weather conditions cooperate?

But all that assumes the weather cooperates. Canadian meteorologist and eclipse enthusiast Jay Anderson has produced a chart based on more than 15 years of data to give a sense of how much cloud cover might be expected in late August along the path of totality.

In Madras, for example, eclipse chasers can expect average cloud cover between around 15 and 20 percent. Moving east, cloud cover generally increases depending on topography and other factors. In Nashville, up to 70 percent of the afternoon sky can be cloud covered.

But as Fienberg noted, climate is what one expects, weather is what one actually gets, ""the idea being that you can predict the statistical likelihood of clear skies based on past history, but weather is a very local phenomenon.""

That said, ""the northwest is going to have a much better chance of clear skies than the southeast.""

""And so, many of the people who are going to be making a sincere effort to see totality are going to be heading to the northwest,"" he said. ""Oregon is very popular, Wyoming, Idaho and Nebraska, all through those states the path of totality is predicted to be 80 percent or 70 percent chance of clear skies. The only exception being the Oregon coast itself.""

The weather might be better in the northwest, but because of the moon's orbital track and changing distance from the Earth, totality will last longer in the southeast.

""Two minutes and 40 seconds in southern Illinois and western Kentucky, whereas it's only going to be a couple of seconds over two minutes in Oregon,"" Fienberg said. ""You want to go where the eclipse will be long, so you tend to go to the point where it's maximum and as close to the center of the path as you can. But you also want to go where the weather prospects are good.

""In this case, a lot of people are going to the northwest,"" he said. ""Even though the eclipse won't be as long, the chance of clear skies is better.""

And if the weather doesn't cooperate, your car breaks down or your flight is canceled before you can reach the path of totality, you'll get a second chance in 2024 due to the nature of the moon's orbit and Earth's path around the sun.

During the 2024 eclipse, the moon's shadow will cross the U.S. border in southern Texas and move up into the eastern half of the United States, passing over Dallas-Fort Worth, Cleveland, Ohio, Buffalo, New York, and Montreal.

The moon will be closer during the 2024 eclipse, its shadow will be wider and totality will last more than four minutes along most of its track across the United States. The paths of the 2017 and 2024 eclipses will cross near Carbondale, Illinois, where residents will witness their second bout of totality in just six and a half years.

""So if you can't get to totality this time, you're going to see all the pictures and movies on the internet, you're going to hear from people who went, you're going to be really motivated for the next one,"" Fienberg said. ""And you've got six and a half years to plan for it."""

In a statement, the foreign ministry said it would require the number of U.S. diplomats in Russia to be reduced by September 1. The statement also said that if the United States further reduced the number of Russian diplomatic staff currently allowed in the U.S., Russia would mirror that action.

The U.S. Embassy in Moscow issued a response, saying, ""we have received the Russian government notification. Ambassador Tefft expressed his strong disappointment and protest. We have passed the notification back to Washington for review.""

Russia's retaliatory move came one day after the U.S. senate voted to approve a new package of sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea and sent it to U.S. President Donald Trump to sign. The legislation bars Mr. Trump from easing or waiving the penalties on Russia unless Congress agrees. The White House has not said definitively whether Mr. Trump will sign the bill.

Russia had been threatening a response to any new U.S. sanctions, with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova telling reporters earlier this month that Moscow would ""have to take reciprocal measures"" if issues between the two countries were not resolved.

Victor Littlefield of Sitka said the killer whale repeatedly rammed the boat, yanked its anchor line and slapped the boat's bow with its tail.

The 33-foot aluminum boat lurched to one side during the attack, Littlefield said in an interview. The event happened while it was anchored Sunday near Little Biorka Island in southeastern Alaska.

Littlefield had seen the movie, ""Jaws"" the previous day and initially thought his boat was being attacked by a great white shark, the Daily Sitka Sentinel reported.

But the culprit was an aggressive orca. Littlefield's black Labrador Retriever, Roscoe was lying on a commercial ice box on the boat and Littlefield said he wondered if the whale was going after the dog.

""It was just extremely bizarre behavior that I'd never heard of,"" he said Tuesday.

Littlefield said he screamed and cursed at the whale during the attack, terrified that the orca would pull the boat under water when it kept twisting the anchorage line around itself.

Littlefield's son videotaped part of the encounter, which lasted a few minutes before the whale swam away. No one was hurt.

""I was pretty much in shock,"" Littlefield told the Daily Sitka Sentinel. ""I couldn't believe it was actually happening.""

Albert Duncan of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Littlefield notified the agency and provided video of the encounter.

Duncan said such attacks are rare and said Littlefield did the right thing by trying to remove himself and his boat from the situation, the newspaper writes.

""It's very rare,"" Duncan said. ""With killer whales there has never been a recorded incident with a fatality in the wild."""

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/to-the-bone-eating-disorders-anorexia-netflix-film/,cbsnews,"""To The Bone"" shines light on eating disorders, but real life can look a lot different",['Ashley Welch'],"This weekend, Netflix premiered ""To the Bone,"" a semi-autobiographical story from writer and director Marti Noxon about a young woman struggling with an eating disorder.

The movie stars Lily Collins, who battled anorexia as a teenager in real life and was required to drop weight for the role.

Before it was even released, the film sparked controversy. Based on scenes from its trailer, critics raised alarm, claiming the movie could glamorize eating disorders, trigger anyone who's struggled with the illness or body image issues, or spur vulnerable viewers to try these behaviors themselves.

Netflix and its creators stuck by the film and its message, saying its purpose is to start important conversations surrounding eating disorders. The film also includes a warning at the start that it shows graphic depictions.

""My goal with the film was not to glamorize EDs [eating disorders], but to serve as a conversation starter about an issue that is too often clouded by secrecy and misconceptions,"" Noxon said in a statement. ""I hope that by casting a little light into the darkness of this disease we can achieve greater understanding and guide people to help if they need it.""

The film succeeds in doing so in certain respects, experts tell CBS News. It sheds light on the complex relationships of family members and the role they play in eating disorder recovery. And there are scenes that dramatize things that should -- and perhaps more often, should not – be said to someone with an eating disorder.

However, when it comes to the movie's portrayal of who suffers from eating disorders and what those struggles actually look like, experts say it doesn't quite mirror the diversity and complexity of real life.

Like the overwhelming majority of mainstream stories about eating disorders, the ""To The Bone"" centers around a young white woman with anorexia.

""When we talk about eating disorders and eating disorders as a serious public health issue, we need to also talk about how they affect people of all sizes, races, ethnicities, socioeconomic status, men and women, boys and girls,"" Claire Mysko, CEO of the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), told CBS News.

According to NEDA, an estimated 20 million women and 10 million men will have an eating disorder in their lifetime.

Though more research is needed in the area, the organization says that the prevalence of most eating disorders is similar among different racial groups -- non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanics, African-Americans and Asians in the United States -- with the exception of anorexia, which is more common among whites.

Studies also suggests that gay, lesbian and bisexual teens may be at higher risk of binge-eating and purging than their heterosexual peers.

Additionally, other research shows that transgender students are almost five times as likely to report an eating disorder.

""To the Bone"" does include a woman of color battling binge-eating disorder and a male character struggling with anorexia.

""But their story lines didn't get a whole lot of play,"" Mysko said. ""Especially the characters of color weren't very well developed in that we didn't get to see much in their experience with eating disorders.""

Stephanie Zerwas, PhD, associate professor and clinical director of the Center of Excellence for Eating Disorders at the UNC School of Medicine, said it is encouraging that the film did include some diversity in its depictions but agrees that it certainly could have gone further.

""It's not fully representative but it's a first step and hopefully it will lead to other fictional representations of eating disorders,"" she told CBS News.

The movie also focuses on an eating disorder in one of the most extreme forms -- a woman with anorexia near death.

While most movies and TV shows about eating disorders portray anorexia, it is actually less common than other eating disorders. An estimated 0.9 percent of women and 0.3 percent of men develop anorexia during their lifetime, compared to 1.5 percent of women and 0.5 percent of men who have bulimia, and 3.5 percent of women and 2 percent of men experience binge eating disorder.

""It's that gap between what works in a movie and what works in real life,"" Zerwas said. ""We see really dramatic situations all the time in movies and we go to that to have an extreme experience sometimes, but that doesn't mean that that's how real life goes.""

Mysko notes that these depictions in the media can have harmful consequences in real life.

""We hear this a lot through our help lines,"" she said. ""People contacting us reaching out for help after struggling for a long time and not recognizing themselves in the depictions they see in film and television. It's this idea that 'I'm not that sick' or 'not sick enough' to reach out for help is really problematic. We really want to advocate as an organization for more diverse representation.""

Still, both experts agree that the film is starting important conversations around eating disorders.

""I am encouraged at the level of discussion that this film has sparked and I hope that we can push for more diverse representations and really challenge the stereotypes about eating disorders,"" Mysko said.

If you or someone you know is suffering from an eating disorder, seek professional help or call the National Eating Disorders Helpline at (800) 931-2237. NEDA's website also offers a number of resources for people living with eating disorders and their families."

Each of the major carriers has reintroduced unlimited data plans as a lure to steal customers from competitors. In January, T-Mobile went all-in on its unlimited option, removing all other options. AT&T and Sprint also touted their own all-you-can-eat options. Then in February, Verizon quietly brought back its own unlimited plan for the first time in seven years.

""The fact that all carriers improved their median download speeds in 20 markets or more suggests that regardless of what is happening with data plans, the carriers are taking steps to mitigate any negatives from increased demand,"" said Annette Hamilton, director at Root Metrics.

For the eighth time in a row, Verizon Wireless ranked No. 1 nationally in overall performance, reliability, speed, data and calls. AT&T took second place, while Sprint was third and T-Mobile ranked fourth.

But T-Mobile argues that the move to unlimited data has taken a toll on AT&T's and Verizon's networks, resulting in slower download speeds for consumers. In a blog post last week, T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray said his company has the fastest wireless network in the U.S.

""The real news is how dramatically both AT&T and Verizon's networks have caved since making unlimited available to their customers -- all while T-Mobile's network has continued to soar,"" he said.

Ray downplayed the results from RootMetrics and insinuated that Verizon is paying RootMetrics to come up with these results.

""Unbiased scientific studies tell us loud and clear that Verizon's network is struggling with unlimited and T-Mobile has caught up,"" Ray said in a statement provided to CNET. ""That's based on millions of actual customer experiences, not consultants funded by Verizon. Color me surprised that a Verizon-sponsored report claims they're on top.""

RootMetrics' Hamilton wouldn't say whether Verizon is a current customer, but she did say that at one time or another all four major carriers have been RootMetrics customers. She also explained that data T-Mobile uses to base its claims is flawed.

T-Mobile's data on network performance comes from crowdsourced apps such as Ookla's SpeedTest. Ray argues that these apps give a more accurate picture of how a network is performing in the real world, because it aggregates testing information from customers who use the app to test their mobile connections. But Hamilton said crowdsourced testing apps don't offer a fair comparison because the testing parameters aren't uniform. There's no way to control for the location or time of day the tests were conducted.

RootMetrics conducts its own testing and it doesn't use crowdsourced data. Instead of taking data from a testing app that consumers use to check their network speed, RootMetrics tests the network itself and has complete control over the testing environment. Hamilton said it gets a more accurate view of network performance because it tries to control the conditions of the test as much as possible.

""You can make statistics say whatever you want,"" she said. ""In this case, T-Mobile is not choosing the most scientifically rigorous data.""

Still, Hamilton doesn't deny that T-Mobile has made major improvements in its performance. In fact, RootMetrics recorded the fastest download speeds in the country from T-Mobile. According to RootMetrics' data, T-Mobile clocked download speeds of 48.9 Mbps in Lansing, Michigan. Its slowest market was in Stockton, California, where it recorded speeds of only 5.8 Mbps.

Sprint also ""showed strong improvements to the number of markets in which it delivered median download speeds of 20 Mbps or faster,"" according to the report. Its fastest median download speed of 33.9 Mbps was recorded by RootMetrics in Atlanta.

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ibm-supercomputer-watson-puppies-guide-dogs-blind/,cbsnews,Artificial intelligence helps determine which puppies can serve the blind,['Don Dahler'],"YORKTOWN HEIGHTS, N.Y. -- If there are two things that seem to be polar opposites, it's the warm exuberance of puppies and the cold intelligence of a supercomputer like IBM's Watson.

At Guiding Eyes for the Blind in Yorktown Heights, New York, need has brought the two together -- to help determine which puppies are good candidates to serve the blind.

""The incidence of blindness is increasing at an incredibly and somewhat alarming rate,"" said Thomas Panek, CEO of the guide dog organization. Panek lost his sight in his 20s.

""Only about 36 percent of the dogs make it"" as a guide dog, he said.

CBS News

To be a successful guide dog, puppies need to be healthy, confident enough to take charge and make decisions on the fly, and most of all, they have to enjoy the work.

For decades, Guiding Eyes for the Blind has been accumulating data, some of it provided by puppy raisers like Lorraine Trapani, who is also an IBM employee.

""TJ is 4 months old and I've already started to collect data on his behavior, things we're working on, things he might be interested in, a bee that's flying by. Things we need to work on so when he's a guide dog, he can ignore those distractions,"" Trapani said.

CBS News

That's where IBM's Watson comes in. So far, Watson has analyzed half a million kilobytes of behavioral data, and that's just the beginning.

CBS News

""It's enabled Guiding Eyes to uncover insights that they couldn't previously do with the resource that they had"" Trapani said.

The system was able to predict with 100 percent accuracy which dogs would make it to graduation.

It costs $50,000 to produce a guide dog, whether they graduate or not. Improving the odds for picking puppies will not only stretch the charity's precious dollars, it will give dogs like TJ a better chance at a rewarding life."

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/amy-joyner-francis-delaware-high-school-bathroom-right-judge-weighs-trying-girl-as-adult/,cbsnews,Judge weighs adult charges in fatal high school bathroom fight,['Crimesider Staff'],"WILMINGTON, Del. -- A cellphone video of a high school restroom fight that left a 16-year-old Delaware girl dead shows the victim on the ground, struggling to fight back and escape as she is repeatedly hit and kicked in the head while her assailant holds on to her hair.

CBS News

The video was shown Monday during a Family Court hearing to decide whether a 16-year-old girl charged in the death of Amy Joyner-Francis should be tried as an adult on charges of criminally negligent homicide and conspiracy.

The judge said he would rule by the end of next week after receiving final written submissions from attorneys.

The defendant is accused of repeatedly hitting Joyner-Francis in a premeditated attack April 21 at Wilmington's Howard High School of Technology. Two other girls are charged with conspiracy.

The Associated Press is not naming the defendants because they are juveniles.

The Division of Youth Rehabilitative Services and a clinical psychologist who testified Monday for the defense have recommended that the alleged assailant be tried in Family Court, meaning she could be sentenced to community supervision if found to be delinquent.

Psychologist Robin Belcher-Timme testified that the girl has responded well to counseling, has no prior criminal history or evidence of personality disorders and presents a low risk of future violence.

""We have an opportunity to intervene,"" he said. He acknowledged that the girl's school performance and attendance had declined in the past year and that some of her friends were delinquent, but he asserted that her issues amount to ""correctible behavior.""

Prosecutors are seeking to try the girl in Superior Court, where she faces up to eight years in prison if convicted. They note that she showed no remorse immediately after the fight or later, after learning that Joyner-Francis, whose fingernails were ripped out during the fight, had died.

""Somebody else must have kicked her. ... Well they're not going to put this on me,"" the girl said after learning of Joyner-Francis' death, according to deputy attorney general Theresa Sedivec.

A medical examiner said Joyner-Francis, 16, had a pre-existing heart condition, but that she was a victim of homicide. Authorities say she suffered sudden cardiac death, with a contributing factor of physical and emotional stress due to physical assault.

In a police affidavit, investigators said the defendants planned the attack over a 20-hour period.

Wilmington police detective Thomas Curley testified that in an online group chat the day before the attack, Joyner-Francis offered advice to one of her friends about a problem involving a boy, telling her friend to ""just be careful."" Curley said the defendants were later brought into the chat, and that the alleged attacker thought Joyner-Francis was talking about her.

Prosecutors played a recording made by a friend of Joyner-Francis of a Snapchat posting by one of the defendants the day before the fight. The post shows Joyner-Francis trying to talk to her alleged assailant in what Curley was told was an attempt to defuse the situation. The posting also includes a message noting that the girl charged with homicide was ""bouta fight her,"" followed by several emojis indicating that a person was laughing so hard she was crying.

In the posting, the defendants can also be heard reportedly saying, ""She's scared. She's scared. We gonna get her.""

Curley also testified that one of the defendants said in an online post the next day that she was told to wear her sneakers, indicating that there was going to be a fight. Joyner-Francis was wearing sandals on the day of the attack, he said.

Curley said a math teacher who responded to the disturbance in the bathroom saw the defendants laughing and giggling as they left. He said the teacher found Joyner-Francis sitting on the floor, trying to prop herself up with her hands before she uttered her last words.

""They jumped me. They snuck me,"" she told the teacher, according to Curley."

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-slaps-iran-with-more-sanctions-after-rocket-launch-into-space/,cbsnews,U.S. slaps Iran with more sanctions after rocket launch into space,[],"WASHINGTON -- The United States punished Iran on Friday for it launch this week of a satellite-carrying rocket into space by hitting six Iranian entities with sanctions targeting the country's ballistic missiles program.

The sanctions hit six Iranian subsidiaries of the Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group, described by the Treasury Department as ""central"" to Iran's ballistic missiles program. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin cast the sanctions as part of an ongoing U.S. effort to aggressively oppose Iran's ballistic missile activity, including what he called a ""provocative space launch"" carried out by the Islamic Republic on Thursday.

""These sanctions target key entities involved in Iran's ballistic missile program, and underscore the United States' deep concerns with Iran's continued development and testing of ballistic missiles and other provocative behavior,"" Mnuchin said in a statement.

In another allegation against the U.S. adversary, Mnuchin said that missile attacks on U.S. partner Saudi Arabia over the weekend by Houthi rebels in Yemen had likely come with the support of Iran. The U.S. has long accused Tehran of shipping weapons to the Houthis, a Shiite group that controls part of Yemen and is being fought by a Saudi-led coalition.

The sanctions come a day after Iran successfully launched its most advanced satellite-carrying rocket into space, in what was likely a major advancement for the country's safe program. The ""Simorgh"" rocket is capable of carrying a satellite weighing 550 pounds, Iran state television said.

Despite the fact it carried a satellite into space, the U.S. has argued the launch was tantamount to a ballistic missile launch because that type of long-range missile technology is inherently designed to be able to carry a nuclear payload. To that end, the State Department has said the launch violated the spirit of the nuclear deal and also flouted a U.N. Security Council resolution that calls on Iran not to conduct such tests.

Yet Iran's foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Friday his country is complying with the nuclear deal that Iran struck with the U.S. and other world powers in 2015. Zarif contrasted that with the U.S., which he suggested was not complying with ""the letter and spirit"" of the deal.

""Rhetoric and actions from the U.S. show bad faith,"" Zarif said.

He also rejected the notion that Iran was working to develop missiles that could carry a nuclear warhead.

""Iran is not & will not be developing nuclear weapons; so by definition cannot develop anything DESIGNED to be capable of delivering them,"" Zarif wrote on Twitter.

Iran is not & will not be developing nuclear weapons; so by definition cannot develop anything DESIGNED to be capable of delivering them.3/3 — Javad Zarif (@JZarif) July 28, 2017

The penalties reflect an attempt by President Trump's administration to show it's staying tough on Iran even though Mr. Trump has yet to scrap the 2015 nuclear deal, despite threatening to do so as a candidate and arguing it's a bad deal.

Under Mr. Trump, like under President Barack Obama, the U.S. has continued to sanction Iran for nonnuclear behavior such as ballistic missile activity that isn't explicitly covered under the nuclear deal. Mr. Trump's administration has also been pushing for inspections of sensitive Iranian military sites where U.S intelligence agencies believe Iran may be conducting illicit activity prohibited by the nuclear pact.

The six entities being sanctioned contribute to Iran's liquid propellant ballistic missiles, the Treasury Department said, including development and manufacturing of engines, launchers, guide-and-control systems and ground support as well as the liquid propellant itself. The sanctions freeze any assets the entities may have in the U.S. and prohibit Americans from doing business with them."
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/pork-falls-from-sky-lands-on-home-travis-adair-florida-mystery/,cbsnews,15-pound bag of frozen pork lands on family's Florida home,[],"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- Meat falling from the sky is weird, even by Florida standards.

But that's what happened at 4 a.m. Saturday when a 15-pound bag of frozen pork landed on the Deerfield Beach home of Travis Adair and his family.

Adair said Thursday that the package hit his roof with a ""big bang."" He thought it was thunder, but his wife Jennie later went outside and found two bundles next to the house. His son Austin found three on the roof.

""It had to fall from the sky,"" Adair said. ""It was too heavy to throw on the roof."" The home is near three airports, so Adair thinks it fell from a plane.

The Federal Aviation Administration had no immediate comment Thursday.

Labeling on the package shows it originally belonged to Jim Williams, who lives 170 miles away in Myakka City, a rural town of 6,300 residents. Williams, who owns a company that prepares fields for planting, said Thursday he bought some pigs from some children at a county fair in January. He kept much of the meat and gave some away but he has no idea how any of it ended up on the Adairs' roof. He is not a pilot and doesn't own a plane.

""I would have thought 15 pounds of frozen meat falling from an airplane would have put a hole in the roof,"" Williams said.

His friend, Jimmy Fussell, who owns the butcher shop that processed the pigs for Williams, said the mystery, which was featured on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!,"" certainly ""beats hearing about all the politics going on."" And it has given everyone in Myakka City a laugh.

As for the meat, the Adairs threw it away -- though Williams has offered to throw the family a barbecue."
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fact-checking-trumps-claims-about-an-improved-department-of-veterans-affairs/,cbsnews,Fact-checking Trump's claims about an improved Department of Veterans Affairs,[],"WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump paints a rosy picture of an improved Department of Veterans Affairs under his watch where accessing electronic medical records is ""so easy and so good"" and health care is freely available without any delays. The problem: It's not true.

At a campaign-style event in Ohio this week, Trump's claims of progress were so overstated that even his own VA secretary, David Shulkin - who stood right next to him - would have to disagree.

""Since my first day in office, we've taken one action after another to make sure that our veterans get the care they so richly deserve,"" Trump said.

But the multibillion-dollar IT initiative Trump cites has yet to be even budgeted, and an alternative program of private-sector care he describes is running out of money and needs reauthorization by Congress. Government auditors and whistleblowers say problems of long wait times and shoddy care persist. Some VA improvements happened before Trump took office.

A look at some of the claims in his Youngstown speech Tuesday:

TRUMP: ""We've begun to process seamlessly transferring veterans' medical records. Horrible situation. You couldn't get your medical records. And now it's so easy and so good. And the system is fixed, finally, after all of these years.""

THE FACTS: While Shulkin announced plans last month to overhaul electronic records by replacing VA's aging information technology system, the multiyear effort has barely even begun. Shulkin has yet to negotiate pricing for the no-bid contract with the company that designed the Pentagon's system. The costs of a new IT system are not accounted for in Trump's proposed 2018 budget.

Shulkin says the new system, when it's complete, also will be used to schedule VA medical appointments. In a May 30 ""State of the VA"" address, Shulkin pointed to the VA's outmoded scheduling systems that would remain in place for several more years for excessive wait times for veterans.

Under questioning by Congress, Shulkin acknowledged the added costs of the IT upgrade could be substantial, running between $4 billion and $16 billion. He says the change will be ""high risk"" with no guarantees of a smooth roll out.

TRUMP: ""We have Choice. ... We have nearly doubled the number of veterans given approvals to see the doctor of their choice.""

THE FACTS: He's exaggerating the progress on this front. Trump is referring to the VA's Choice program, which offers federally paid medical care outside the VA. Put in place after a 2014 wait-time scandal at the Phoenix VA, the program allows veterans to see outside doctors if they must wait more than 30 days for an appointment or drive more than 40 miles to a VA facility.

VA's approvals to veterans to use Choice have grown under Trump, but they haven't nearly doubled. Shulkin wrote in a USA Today editorial this week that outside care programs for the first half of the year increased 26 percent over the same period last year.

Trump also glossed over Choice's financial woes.

The VA had assured Congress that the program's money would last until early next year. But Shulkin last month admitted that Choice suddenly faced a shortfall and would run out of money by mid-August. He cited excessive authorizations and poor budget planning.

Congress is now scrambling to provide billions in emergency money to fill the gap, or risk disruptions in veterans' care.

TRUMP: ""We've published wait times at every VA facility. I used to go around and talk about the veterans and they'd stand on line for nine days, seven days, four days ... 15 days. People that could have been given a prescription and been better right away end up dying waiting on line. That's not happening anymore.""

THE FACTS: Problems of delay or substandard care at some of the VA facilities have not disappeared.

The VA did begin publishing data in April on wait times at VA medical centers. Planning for it started 18 months earlier, under the Obama administration.

According to Shulkin's ""State of the VA"" report, the VA is ""still in critical condition,"" with veterans waiting more than 60 days for new appointments at about 30 VA facilities nationwide. He also says about 1 in 6 primary care clinics is over capacity, ""meaning veterans are not being seen soon enough.""

On quality of care, the VA's inspector general issued urgent action reports in April and May, warning that patients at the Washington, D.C., VA medical center were being put at unnecessary risk of harm due to bad inventory practices, like potentially dirty syringes and medical supply shortages.

The Boston Globe also reported this month that 11 physicians and medical employees alleged the Manchester VA Medical Center in New Hampshire was needlessly endangering patients. The report described a fly-infested operating room and surgical instruments that weren't always sterilized.

Shulkin has since ordered top-down reviews and removed the medical directors in Manchester and Washington.

TRUMP: ""We've delivered same-day mental health services at every VA medical center.""

THE FACTS: This may be the case, but it happened before Trump took office. Shulkin, an Obama administration holdover, publicized the effort as VA's undersecretary of health in April 2016, before Trump was elected. By late 2016, the department's blog announced that the goal of providing same-day primary and mental-health care when medically necessary would be achieved at every VA medical center by year's end.

A Dec. 23, 2016, article in the Harvard Business Review cites new same-day services at all VA hospitals as evidence of notable progress under former VA Secretary Bob McDonald ""and his team."" Shulkin told Congress in late January the services already were fully in place."

Most recently, Zac made a DIY “Beauty and the Beast” enchanted rose for Emily.

He also set the table for dinner with a silver candelabra and antique dishes to recreate her favorite movie, making her feel like a real-life Belle.

Zac and Emily Rendell

“I had no idea. Zac kicked me out of the house,” Emily, 23, recalled. “I was thinking, ‘Oh my goodness, what am I going to come back to?’ He had the fireplace in the background on the TV crackling and he had music on. I was blown away.”

Zac and Emily Rendell

Not be outdone, Emily then returned the kind gesture with an elaborate “Star Wars”-themed date night for her husband, she said.

“I went to the dollar store and got fairly inexpensive things. Making all the signs took the longest because creativity takes a long time,” said Emily.

Zac and Emily Rendell

When Zac returned home for his surprise, Emily met him at the door with a miniature lightsaber.

“I’m standing there just awestruck reading this story she creatively wrote for me on the stairs,” he recalled. “She called us the Rendells instead of the rebels. I made my way up the stairs and saw the big setup there with the Millennium Falcon and the lights.”

Zac and Emily Rendell

Their movie snacks included “princess” Lays potato chips, Obi-Wan cannoli and Yoda soda.

Zac and Emily Rendell

The couple said their favorite wedding advice was to “never stop dating.”

“We got married pretty young because when you know it’s the right person, you know,” said Zac. “Something we always got told was, ‘Never stop dating. Never stop going out and dressing up for the other person. Never lose that.’ It was important for us to make a habit of that and continue to do that once we began our lives together.”

So far, they’re nailing it.

Abbas underwent routine checks, including blood tests and X-rays at the private Al Istishari Hospital near the West Bank town of Ramallah, and left after 90 minutes, said the hospital director, Dr. Fathi Abu Mughli.

""The results are good,"" Abu Mughli told The Associated Press, but did not elaborate.

Abbas was flanked by aides and smiling when he left the hospital.

Abbas has suffered heart problems in the past, but his doctors have said he is fine. A year ago, Abbas underwent an emergency heart procedure after suffering exhaustion and chest pains. He went through a number of tests, including a cardiac catheterization, a procedure that can detect and treat heart problems, but was given a clean bill of health.

Last month, Abbas dispelled rumors he had suffered a stroke.

Any health scare for Abbas heightens concerns over the uncertain leadership situation in the Palestinian territories — which are divided between two rival governments and where there is no succession plan for the aging leader.

Abbas, who has no plans to step down, has ignored calls to appoint a successor, setting the stage for a bitter power struggle if he is incapacitated.

Abbas was elected president in 2005 for what was supposed to be a four-year term.

But in 2007 the rival Hamas militant group forcefully seized control of the Gaza Strip after their victory in parliamentary elections a year earlier. Abbas remained in power, left in charge of autonomous enclaves in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

Abbas, who is a heavy smoker and overweight, was treated years ago with prostate cancer and has had a stent inserted to treat artery blockage."
http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/experts-warn-parents-snapchat-hook-teens-streaks/story?id=48778296,go,Experts warn parents how Snapchat can hook in teens with streaks,['Abc News'],"Teens are on their phones more than six-and-a-half hours a day, according to the nonprofit Common Sense Media. More than half of teens text and nearly all use social media apps, and this daily behavior may not be entirely their fault.

Many games and social media apps are designed to get people “hooked” and keep coming back, Dr. Jodi Gold, the author of “Screen Smart Parenting,” explained to ABC News.

Take Snapchat, the super popular app among teens for sharing photos and video, which has mechanisms in place to incentivize teens to become daily users with a phenomenon called the Snapstreak.

Snapchat friends exchange a photo daily for three consecutive days to start a ""streak."" If one day is missed, the streak will expire. The app tracks the streak, upping the number next to the friend's name as the Snapstreak continues.

Experts like Dr. Jodi Gold say streaks can create a concerning hierarchy of friendship that can leave some teens afraid to disappoint others if they drop a streak -- or petrified about any change in status.

""This has become extremely important -- especially to teenagers,"" Gold explained.

It's become so important that 18-year-old friends Sherlana and Ray have a 405-day Snapstreak. That means they’ve been sending each other a photo of something every day for more than a year.

The two are so invested in their streaks that if they can’t get onto the app, they turn to their mothers to send snaps for them.

“When she sees that [hourglass] come on and she can't get onto the WiFi, you know, then she starts to panic,” Sherlana’s mom, Cindy Alphonse, told ABC News.

Snapchat told ABC News that Snapstreaks are ""designed to be light-hearted and fun.""

It's not just apps that suck teens in. Smartphone games like the popular strategy game Clash Royale, which has rocketed to the top of the charts, can be habit-forming.

Gold’s 11-year-old son, Carter Gold, says the game was so addicting for him that he had to delete the app from his phone in order to fully remove himself.

""They always try and pull you in more and then they kind of never let you leave until you finally quit it,"" Carter said.

Supercell, the maker of Clash Royale, told ABC News: ""We want people to enjoy our games when they play them but we make it easy to leave if they don't.""

Gold says the concern is not necessarily how many hours kids log on the apps, but how important they are to the teen’s self-worth.

“The more you cannot leave one day without being on social media, the more your identity gets wrapped up in it [and] the more likely it's going to have negative effects,” she said."
http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/tree-tents-campers-off-ground-air-48915107,go,Tree tents get campers off the ground and into the air,['Abc News'],"Campers and outdoor enthusiasts are embracing a unique way to sleep under the stars while in the mountains or at the beach — dangling between trees on hybrid hammock-tents that get them off the ground and into portable treehouses that soothe their inner child.

Some of the gravity-defying devices were on display this week in Salt Lake City at the Outdoor Retailer show, which brings thousands of people for a business-to-business expo that allows retail store owners to meet with companies and manufacturers that display products.

The so-called tree tents are still too small of an industry segment to track sales separately. But retailers report they are generating growing demand from customers, said Matt Powell, sports industry analyst with market research firm NPD Group.

""The millennial camper is looking for products that are going to keep them dry and comfortable, which is one thing these do,"" Powell said. ""Millennials are also attracted to versatile items that have more than one purpose, as these do.""

The hammock-tents, which can be broken down stored in bags like normal tents, are designed to be used anywhere a person can find trees, boulders or rock crevices sturdy enough to anchor them.

Tentsile's colorful polyester hammocks and tents that stretch between three trees are the creation of an English treehouse architect who started the company four years ago with another designer based on his childhood dream of creating something resembling the Ewoks' tree villages from the ""Star Wars"" movies.

The company's flagship model is the ""Stingray"" tent that holds at least three adults up to 880 pounds, selling for $650. It has a front entrance as well as hole in the middle you can climb through. The company sells five other models that range in size and design and sell from $150 to $550. They are tied around trees using straps and ratchets.

""You're in the trees so you're shaded, and it's nice and cool. It also keeps you off the ground from snakes and spiders and all that creepy stuff,"" said Melissa Benjamin, a company representative.

Sales have skyrocketed from 10 in 2013 to about 10,000 last year, Tentsile spokeswoman Kirstie Grego said.

Treepod makes teardrop-shaped hanging treehouses with a large open entrance that allow people to lounge or sleep in them while they swing from side to side. The Boulder, Colorado-based company formed in 2015 after company President Ricardo Bottome's brother challenged him to make the fun idea come to life.

They sell three types ranging from 4 to 6 feet and selling for $200 to $300. The canvas treehouses hook onto trees by throwing a rope over a branch and through a steel quick link hooked to the top of the tent. They can be used at the beach, the mountains or your own backyard or porch.

They hit retail stores for the first time in 2016, with the company doing about $1 million in sales, Bottome said. They are on pace to double that this year, he said.

""Picture yourself in this one, you're at a beach, you're getting the breeze, you can see out and you have a shade,"" Bottome said. ""It's like paradise.""

Michelle Ennis, owner of paddle board rental company in southern Utah, stopped at the Treepod display because she and her husband are considering buying some to rent to customers by the hour. She and her husband and her two sons lounged in the largest of the swinging treehouses as her sons begged their mother to get them one for the backyard.

""I love how easy they are to set up. I love their comfort,"" Ennis said.

While Treepod and Tentsile are new, Canadian industrial engineer Tom Hennessy has been selling his hammocks since 1999. His company, Hennessy Hammocks, has developed 24 different models that range from $79 to $350, he said. They allow a camper to get inside and zip up inside a mesh cover that is covered by a rain tarp.

Their slogan is, ""It's a tent... It's a hammock... It's a chair...It's a lounger... It's a supershelter!""

Hennessy, who said he grew up sleeping in hammocks, said what sets his apart are an asymmetrical diamond design with a ridgeline that doesn't change shape to give people a comfortable sleep. He said his customers are diverse, including backpackers, soldiers, Boy Scouts, motorcyclists and long-distance hikers.

Powell of the NPD Group said he expects to see other companies come out with their own tree tents in the coming years. ""When a good idea comes along, the industry responds by trying to make it better or less expensive,"" he said."

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/analysis-front-center-mccain-shows-power-allies-dc/story?id=48912107,go,"ANALYSIS: Front and center, McCain shows the power of allies in DC","['Abc News', 'More Maryalice']","By putting himself front and center of the growing divide between the Republican White House and Republican Congress, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., sent a powerful message to the president early Friday morning: It takes allies to get anything done in this town.

On Tuesday, Republicans cheered their Arizona senator when he swooped in and kept their hopes of passing an Obamacare repeal alive. But by the wee hours of Friday, it was Democrats who wanted to hug the war hero for voting with them to keep the Affordable Care Act on the books and defeat the last Republican plan standing, known as the ""skinny"" repeal. In a blink, President Donald Trump's tweets about McCain moved from appreciation to anger.

Governing is hard. It is always easier to unite a party in opposition than it is to get everyone to agree on what should be the law of the land. The president this morning argued that Senate leadership should change the rules, but lowering the threshold to 51 votes on non-budget bills would not have helped them when they could not get 50 Republican senators to stand together. Instead, looking in the mirror and acknowledging the vast differences in opinions in their ranks might be necessary if Republicans hope to pass any legislation down the road. That, and maybe working across the aisle.

McCain has not been a health care champion, but his move means he will likely get his bigger wish: a return to more regular order. Boring or sheepish as it sounds, committee work, incremental legislation and even bipartisanship might be more of what’s in store.

There will be questions about whether Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., should go, as there were after House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., struggled to unify his colleagues voting too. But a big move like that still seems far off. Leadership from both chambers agree that they should tackle tax reform next. It is a topic less politically explosive than health care, but still plenty controversial. The defeat over health care is more likely to make tax reform harder, not easier.

Yes, Republicans may feel desperate for a win, but many must also feel burned. Senators like Dean Heller, R-Nev., Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., and Rob Portman, R-Ohio, were not jazzed about the options presented to them on health care, but they went out on a limb for McConnell. Heller is considered the party's most vulnerable Republican, but he and others toed the party line and made politically risky votes because leadership said it would work out. They could be much harder to convince next go-around. Democrats will inevitably start trying to hang Heller on that vote. The fact that some top Republicans said on camera Thursday night, just hours before the vote, that the plan was a ""disaster"" gave fodder for dozens of Democratic ads.

Plus, Republicans had hoped to scrap a number of taxes in an Obamacare repeal. They may have to do some rewrites on tax reform now.

Earlier this year, it seemed the White House was much more read-in and focused on the nuances of tax reform, but the ongoing sagas in Washington, D.C., have left Congress less interested in working with the folks down Pennsylvania Avenue.

The president’s threat to let the health care marketplaces implode and pull subsidies for people buying insurance does not have support among mainstream Republicans. And, in what may have been a sign to Trump, that sanctions bill that passed this week with overwhelming margins in both chambers was designed to limit presidential power."
http://abcnews.go.com/International/stake-venezuelas-election/story?id=48905914,go,What's at stake in Venezuela's election?,['Abc News'],"On Sunday, Venezuelans will head to the polls to choose delegates that would help rewrite the country's constitution in one of the country’s most divisive elections. The vote comes after months of economic crisis, political instability, mass protests, sanctions from the U.S. and violence.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has said the vote is a chance to bring unity and peace to the country.

""July 30 brings a total renovation, a rebirth of the original Bolivarian spirit, a rebirth of peace and a homeland of equality,"" Maduro said Thursday, referring to the movement started by Hugo Chavez, according to VTV.

For the opposition, who have vowed to boycott it, Sunday's vote represents an illegal move to try to strip the country’s legislative body of its power.

""What's at stake is nothing less than the loss of freedom of Venezuela and the initiation of the Cuban model in a false, illegal, constitutional way,"" Diego Arria, a former governor of Caracas and an opposition leader living in the U.S., told ABC News.

But both sides agree on one thing –- that the July 30 vote marks a crucial turning point after months of turbulence. So what is at stake, and how could this vote impact the country's future?

What kind of crisis is Venezuela experiencing?

Venezuela's economic woes have roots in a currency crisis that was deepened by falling oil prices in the petroleum-dependent country, according to George Ciccariello-Maher, an associate professor at Drexel University and the author of “Building the Commune: Radical Democracy in Venezuela.”

""Since 2012, we saw the beginning of a crisis originating many ways in the exchange rate system, which is a fixed exchange rate system,” Ciccariello-Maher told ABC News. “That, along with a number of other factors, really spiraled into a much deeper crisis today. The collapse in oil prices exacerbated this situation, the government did not respond quickly enough to adjust the exchange rate system and it created a whole system of black market currency and smuggling, which created these shortages of goods.”

Venezuela, like many oil-rich countries, imports much of its food and consumer goods. The problem isn’t necessarily that Venezuelans don’t have the money to buy certain products, but rather that the products themselves are scarce or completely unavailable. This has had a huge impact on people’s everyday lives and on the country’s political system.

“The dire economic crisis that Venezuela is facing -- with rampant shortages of food, medicine and other basic goods -- is a major factor contributing to the country's current political instability,” Alexander Main, a senior associate for international policy at the Center for Economic Policy and Research, told ABC News via email. “Urban centers, particularly Caracas, have been rocked by months of constant protests, in which demonstrators from the middle classes protest shortages and call for the departure of President Maduro.”

According to the country's chief prosecutor, more than 100 people have been killed since early April, The Associated Press reported. The government announced security measures that include banning protests through Tuesday, a move the United Nations and other freedom of speech groups have criticized, the AP reported.

What is Sunday's vote trying to accomplish?

Venezuela’s constitution was written during a previous national constituent assembly in 1999 under then-President Chavez. Now, Chavez’s protégé and the country's current president, Maduro, is giving Venezuelans the opportunity to elect delegates to rewrite or modify that constitution.

“It’s the legislature positioned against the executive and the judiciary, which is creating chaos in the state apparatus itself and a lasting deadlock that has been going on for well over a year now,"" Ciccariello-Maher said. ""This is the backdrop and this is why the constituent assembly is being posed as one of the ways to break this deadlock and move forward.""

Maduro and his party said they have the right to call for the assembly, but opposition politicians said he should have first asked the public to approve it in a referendum, as Chavez had previously done.

""First of all, this is a constituent assembly that was convened illegally for one simple reason: the president doesn't have a reason to convene it, the people do. The people can express themselves through voting. But the president didn't do that. The president convened a constituent assembly and then set the rules of the game,"" Orlando Molina, president of the Latin American Institute for Strategic Studies and a member of the opposition, told ABC News from Caracas.

It’s not clear whether Venezuelans would have chosen to have the vote had Maduro asked them; earlier this month, more than 7 million people voted in a symbolic referendum against the July 30 vote, according to the AP.

""The problems of Venezuela can't be resolved with a constituent assembly,"" Molina added.

And with opposition groups vowing to boycott Sunday's vote, it's unlikely that it will bring unity.

""The vote is yet another polarizing factor that will make it more difficult to achieve some form of reconciliation,"" Main said. ""However, what happens after Sunday's vote is critical. There is an opportunity to embark on a larger discussion about the country's political future in which the government would be wise to offer to recognize the powers of the opposition-controlled legislature and the opposition would be wise to discuss recognizing the constitutional legitimacy of Maduro's presidential mandate.""

Opposition parties are also concerned that Maduro will dissolve the National Assembly, which they control, while the constituent assembly does its work, although Maduro has not indicated he would, Main said.

What will happen after Sunday’s vote?

Leaders both for and against the national constituent assembly acknowledge that it will not have an immediate impact on the country's political and economic instability. But once chosen, the 545 members elected by region and by economic sector will convene within 72 hours and get to work, according to Telesur.

“The question isn’t: ‘Is this the perfect solution?’ but ‘Is this a solution?’” Ciccariello-Maher said. “Because there really are no solutions on the table to this deepening crisis.”

Presidential elections are set to be held in 2018, but some opposition groups want Maduro to step down before then.

""The bigger problem is governance. There is too much hunger and too much misery, and this is just going to deepen the crisis in Venezuela. The same government with all the power it has is not going to be able to control things,"" Molina said. ""This could provoke a civil war or a military coup.""

""There are sectors of Chavismo that aren't radical who, along with the opposition, are looking for ways out, such as a transitional government. And that's what we're working on,"" Molina said.

Arria, who said he faces arrest if he returns to Venezuela and has had his passport annulled, agreed.

""I believe that we should have a transitional government for at least two years that would attempt to decipher and dismantle the network of corruption that has been created,"" Arria said.

But others stress that dialogue, and the support of the international community for it, are the keys to peace.

""For the country to avoid civil war, dialogue is the only way forward,"" Main said. ""If the U.S. wishes to help Venezuela resolve its political and economic crises, it needs to put aside talk of further sanctions and, instead, push both sides to reinitiate dialogue and support the ongoing efforts of former Spanish President Zapatero and Pope Francis to bring the two sides to the negotiating table."""

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/us-hits-iran-sanctions-response-space-launch-48911108,go,Western nations decry Iran space launch; US levies sanctions,['Abc News'],"The United States punished Iran on Friday for launching a satellite-carrying rocket into space by hitting six Iranian entities with sanctions targeting the country's ballistic missiles program.

Three European nations that helped broker the landmark Iran nuclear deal in 2015 joined the U.S. in condemning the launch, and said it was too close for comfort to the type of intercontinental ballistic missiles used to deliver a nuclear payload. At the United Nations, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said Iran was ""breaking its obligation"" and added, ""We can't trust them.""

""Under this administration, the United States will not let Iran off the hook for behavior that threatens our interests and our allies,"" Haley said. ""We will continue to impose consequences until Iran stops its provocations and complies fully with Security Council resolutions.""

The U.S. sanctions hit six Iranian subsidiaries of the Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group, described by the Treasury Department as ""central"" to Iran's ballistic missiles program. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin cast the sanctions as part of an ongoing U.S. effort to aggressively oppose Iran's ballistic missile activity, including what he called a ""provocative space launch"" carried out by the Islamic Republic on Thursday.

In another allegation against the U.S. adversary, Mnuchin said that missile attacks on U.S. partner Saudi Arabia over the weekend by Houthi rebels in Yemen had likely come with the support of Iran. The U.S. has long accused Tehran of shipping weapons to the Houthis, a Shiite group that controls part of Yemen and is being fought by a Saudi-led coalition.

The sanctions came a day after Iran successfully launched its most advanced satellite-carrying rocket into space, in what was likely a major advancement for the country's space program. The ""Simorgh"" rocket is capable of carrying a satellite weighing 550 pounds (250 kilograms), Iran state television said.

The U.S. National Air and Space Intelligence Center said in a report released last month that the Simorgh could act as a test bed for developing the technologies needed to produce an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM.

In a joint statement, the U.S., Britain, Germany and France called the launch ""inconsistent"" with the U.N. Security Council resolution enshrining the nuclear deal, adding that such activities destabilize the region. The grouping represented all of the Western nations that are part of the nuclear deal, which also includes Russia, China and the European Union.

""We condemn this action,"" the countries said. ""We call on Iran not to conduct any further ballistic missile launches and related activities.""

Yet beyond the U.S. sanctions, it was unclear what, if anything, the group could do to increase pressure quickly on Tehran. Notably, the nations stopped short of saying the launch had ""violated"" the U.N. resolution, saying only that it was ""inconsistent"" with the text. That's because the resolution calls upon, but doesn't oblige, Iran to refrain from ballistic missile development.

Yet Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif pushed back on any suggestion his country had done anything wrong by launching the satellite into space. He said Friday that Iran is complying with the nuclear deal and drew a contrast with the U.S., accusing Washington of not complying with ""the letter and spirit"" of the deal.

""Rhetoric and actions from the U.S. show bad faith,"" Zarif said.

He also rejected the notion that Iran was working to develop missiles that could carry a nuclear warhead.

""Iran is not and will not be developing nuclear weapons; so by definition cannot develop anything designed to be capable of delivering them,"" Zarif wrote on Twitter.

Britain, Germany and France also said they were raising their concerns directly to the Islamic Republic. Despite brokering the nuclear deal, the U.S. doesn't maintain regular diplomatic relations with Iran.

The U.S. penalties reflect an attempt by President Donald Trump's administration to show it's staying tough on Iran even though Trump has yet to scrap the 2015 nuclear agreement, despite threatening to do so as a candidate and labelling it a bad deal.

Under Trump, like under President Barack Obama, the U.S. has continued to sanction Iran for nonnuclear behavior such as ballistic missile activity that isn't explicitly covered under the nuclear deal. Trump's administration has also been pushing for inspections of sensitive Iranian military sites where U.S intelligence agencies believe Iran may be conducting illicit activity prohibited by the nuclear pact.

The six entities being sanctioned contribute to Iran's liquid propellant ballistic missiles, the Treasury Department said, including development and manufacturing of engines, launchers, guide-and-control systems and ground support as well as the liquid propellant itself. The sanctions freeze any assets the entities may have in the U.S. and prohibit Americans from doing business with them.

You’re looking for a baby name that’s cool and usable, but you’d prefer if your child wasn’t one of many Jessicas/Michaels/Sophias in school — destined to be identified with a last initial. You moan and groan when your favorite formerly unique names (Henry, Penelope, Oliver) creep up into the “popular” zone, and you take your naming seriously.

And so I give you some of the coolest baby names that haven’t hit the Top 1,000…yet:



GIRLS First up, the ladies…

Amalia Meaning: Work A less-popular alternative to Amelia.

Mabel Meaning: Lovable First of all, how about that meaning? Mabel is one of those old-fashioned granny names coming back into fashion — but not fast enough to make it into the Top 1,000. Use it before it starts climbing.

Wren Meaning: A bird A sweet songbird of a name.

Etta Meaning: Estate ruler In a world where Emmas and Ellas abound, Etta is a similar yet jazzier cousin.

Aurelia Meaning: The golden one A more glittering, star-struck cousin to the Disney-inspired Aurora.

Emmeline Meaning: Work There’s something about “Em-“ names that are especially attractive (Emma/Emily/Emilia/Amelia), and Emmeline has the classic femininity without the modern trendiness.

Margot Meaning: Pearl Beyond the attractive meaning, Margot feels both classic and exotic, with a trendy o-ending.

Faye Meaning: Fairy This is an especially cool middle name option, similar to Mae and Rae. It’s also a vintage choice deserving a comeback.

Louisa Meaning: Renowned warrior Another vintage name that’s starting to register on our radar.

Gwen Meaning: White circle It’s not so much “in” anymore, but it’s not so far out that it’s unfashionable. I think Gwen has a classic appeal.

Magnolia Meaning: Flower name Similar to Lily, Daisy, and Iris, Magnolia is an ultra-feminine flower name with a unique spin.

Cordelia Meaning: Heart; Daughter of the sea A sophisticated yet stylish name that’s hanging out just below the Top 1,000 list.

Rosie Meaning: A diminutive of Rose A perkier version of Rose.

Poppy Meaning: Flower name The spunkiest of feminine flower names, which is popular overseas (Poppy is in the UK’s Top 20).

Maisie Meaning: Pearl It sounds like friendly Daisy, but with the attractive nickname option of Mae. And it’s all wrapped up with a vintage vibe.

Delia Meaning: “Born on the island of Delos” A popular nickname for Cordelia (another Outside-the-Top-1,000 pick), Delia has a poetic feel.

Remi Meaning: Oarsman Despite the slightly off-putting meaning, Remi has a modern quirkiness that’s very much in style right now.

Clementine Meaning: Mild, merciful This is a buzzed-about name in the online naming community, but still completely off the nation’s radar. Read: Your friends will think it’s cool, but your parents will give the stink eye.

Florence Meaning: Flourishing, prosperous Florence has all the qualities of a chart-climbing name — vintage, exotic, feminine, and it’s even a place name. Will Florence and the Machine give it a boost up? Maybe, but it currently ranks way down in “unique” territory. So have at it.

Sally Meaning: Princess Well, it means princess; we can start with that. And it’s also a super happy and friendly name — with a trendy mid-century flair.

Elodie Meaning: Marsh flower This one feels like it should be popular, but it’s totally not. So that’s probably exactly what you want in a name.

Maren Meaning: Sea Maren is a unique variation of Mary — so you could easily use it as a more modern namesake.

Astrid Meaning: Divinely beautiful Well she’ll always love the meaning of her name — that’s for certain. The name “Astrid” is pretty popular over in Sweden and Denmark, and it’s heard more frequently in the name-enthusiast community, but your little girl probably won’t have multiple Astrids in her class.

Ellison Meaning: Son of Ellis She might have to go through her life saying “N-no ELLison, not Allison,” but it’s a unique “Elle”/”Ellie” name.

Flora Meaning: Flower Flower names are extremely popular right now, but there are a few attractive options that haven’t fully caught on yet, like Poppy and Iris. Add “Flora” to that list. (Also: the Disney connection, obviously)

BOYS And now the boys…

Grey Meaning: Color name The more formal version of Grayson/Greyson is quickly scooting up the ranks, Grey is an attractive color name that’s hanging just below the Top 1,000 list. It could be an especially awesome middle name choice.

Garrison Meaning: Son of Garret A more modern twist to the outdated Gary, and Garrison also has the trendy feel of a place name and/or surname name.

Taj Meaning: Crown Taj made two brief appearances in the Top 1,000 (1976 and 1998), and it has a cool vibe that consistently leaves it lingering in “unique but usable” territory.

Magnus Meaning: Greatest Magnus exudes power (and maybe a little ego), so it might require a strong personality. But with the right personality — man, it could soar.

Miller Meaning: Grinder of grain It’s still pretty unique, but it has the trendy “surname name” and “occupational name” qualities.

Ford Meaning: Dweller at the ford He might have to live with an association to cars, but it’s becoming a rising surname name.

Thatcher Meaning: Roof thatcher Another occupational-meets-surname name that’s trendy yet unique. It’s also a modern twist on Tyler and Taylor.

Bishop Meaning: Occupation name Perhaps following in Deacon’s path?

Enoch Meaning: Dedicated We all know the extreme popularity of Biblical names (like Noah, Caleb, etc.). And Enoch is a strong Old Testament name deserving of a revival.

Duke Meaning: English rank of nobility Again, it takes the right personality — but it might be right for you.

Judson Meaning: Son of Jordan A hybrid of popular Hudson-Jackson, Judson could provide the right kind of alternative. It also kind of sounds like 80s-favorite “Justin”.

Otis Meaning: Wealthy It’s short and punchy, with a vintage flair and trendy hard “O” sound. This is certainly a cool choice.

Baylor Meaning: “Horse trainer” A modern upgrade to Taylor.

Cortez Meaning: Courteous English and Irish surnames are sprinkled throughout the Top 1,000, but this unique Spanish surname could have the unique flair you’re looking for.

Cormac Meaning: Tree trunk Cormac has never made it onto the US Top 1,000 list, but it’s a traditionally Irish name steeped in Celtic culture.

Keller Meaning: Cellar master A German surname that has the trendy “two-syllable name ending in ‘-er” thing going for it — i.e. Cooper, Asher, Ryder, etc.

Louie Meaning: Renowned warrior A friendlier version of Louis — and it makes the French pronunciation easier to recognize (rather than having to say “It’s Lou-ee, not Lou-iss” ).

Clifford Meaning: “Lives near the ford by the cliff” You’ll have to take the Big Red Dog association into consideration — you know, for kids — but Clifford is starting to come back into fashion.

http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/time-move-health-care-senate-gop-leader-48923702,go,"'Time to move on' from health care, Senate GOP leader says",['Abc News'],"The resounding Senate crash of the seven-year Republican drive to scrap the Obama health care law has led to finger-pointing but also has left the party with wounded leaders and no evident way ahead on an issue that won't go away.

In an astonishing cliff-hanger, the GOP-run Senate voted 51-49 on Friday to reject Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's last ditch attempt to sustain their drive to dismantle President Barack Obama's health care overhaul with a starkly trimmed-down bill.

The vote, which concluded shortly before 2 a.m. EDT, was a blistering defeat for President Donald Trump and McConnell, R-Ky.

""They should have approved health care last night,"" Trump said Friday during a speech in Brentwood, New York. ""But you can't have everything,"" he added, seemingly shrugging off one of his biggest legislative setbacks.

Trump reiterated his threat to ""let Obamacare implode,"" an outcome he could hasten by steps such as halting federal payments to help insurers reduce out-of-pocket costs for lower-earning consumers.

Senate Democrats were joined in opposition by three Republicans — Maine's Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Arizona's John McCain. The 80-year-old McCain, just diagnosed with brain cancer, had returned to the Capitol three days earlier to provide a vote that temporarily kept the measure alive, only to deliver the coup de grace Friday.

""Republicans in the Senate will NEVER win if they don't go to a 51 vote majority NOW. They look like fools and are just wasting time,"" Trump tweeted Saturday. He said the ""Republican Senate must get rid of 60 vote NOW! It is killing the R Party."" But on the crucial vote, a simple majority of 51 votes, including a tie-breaker by Vice President Mike Pence, was all that was needed.

""Hello, he only needed 51 in the health care bill and couldn't do it,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., helpfully reminded reporters.

Earlier in the week, Republican defections sank GOP efforts to scrap the 2010 law. One would have erased Obama's statute and replaced it with a more constricted government health care role, and the other would have annulled the law and given Congress two years to replace it.

The measure that fell Friday was narrower and included a repeal of Obama's unpopular tax penalties on people who don't buy policies and on employers who don't offer coverage to workers. McConnell designed it as a legislative vehicle the Senate could approve and begin talks with the House on a compromise, final bill.

But the week's setbacks highlighted how, despite years of trying, GOP leaders haven't resolved internal battles between conservatives seeking to erase Obama's law and moderates leery of tossing millions of voters off of coverage.

""It's time to move on,"" McConnell said after the defeat.

Friday morning, House leaders turned to singer Gordon Lightfoot to point fingers. They opened a House GOP meeting by playing ""The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,"" a ballad about the 1975 sinking of a freighter in Lake Superior. Lawmakers said leaders assured them it was meant as a reference to the Senate's flop.

The House approved its health care measure in May, after its own tribulations.

In a statement, Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., pointedly said ""the House delivered a bill.""

He added, ""I encourage the Senate to continue working toward a real solution that keeps our promise.""

Conservative Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., running for a Senate seat, faulted McConnell for not crafting a plan that could pass. He said if McConnell abandons the health care drive, ""he should resign from leadership.""

One moderate Republican said Trump shared responsibility.

""One of the failures was the president never laid out a plan or his core principles and never sold them to the American people,"" said Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa. ""Outsourced the whole issue to Congress.""

In statements Friday, McCain said the Senate bill didn't lower costs or improve care and called the chamber's inability to craft wide-ranging legislation ""inexcusable."" He said Democrats and Republicans should write a bill together and ""stop the political gamesmanship.""

Lawmakers spoke of two possible but difficult routes forward.

In one, balking GOP senators could be won over by new proposals from leaders or cave under pressure from angry constituents demanding they fulfill the party's pledge to tear down Obama's law. But both of those dynamics have been in play all year without producing results.

In the other, there would be a limited bipartisan effort to address the insurance market's short-term concerns. That would provide money to insurers to help them subsidize some customers and prevent companies from driving up premiums or abandoning regions.

Schumer said he hoped the two parties could ""work together to make the system better"" by stabilizing marketplaces.

But many conservatives oppose such payments and consider them insurance industry bailouts, raising questions about whether Congress could approve such a package.

McConnell said it was time for Democrats ""to tell us what they have in mind."" But saying he was backed by most Republicans, he added, ""Bailing out insurance companies, with no thought of any kind of reform, is not something I want to be part of.""

But given the announcement Friday of the resignation of White House chief of staff Reince Preibus, it's not surprising that Ayer's swearing-in was eclipsed by the Oval Office staff shake-up.

""Congrats to @Nick_Ayers for being sworn-in as my Chief of Staff,"" Pence tweeted, along with photos of Ayers being sworn in, next to his wife and children. ""Excited to welcome you & great having your family at @WhiteHouse today.""

Congrats to @Nick_Ayers for being sworn-in as my Chief of Staff. Excited to welcome you & great having your family at @WhiteHouse today. pic.twitter.com/oQPymdSQqa — Vice President Pence (@VP) July 28, 2017

Ayers retweeted Pence, adding a shout-out to his new colleague, ""Honored and humbled beyond words. Excited to partner with General Kelly to serve and support @POTUS and @VP #MAGA.""

Honored and humbled beyond words. Excited to partner with General Kelly to serve and support @POTUS and @VP #MAGA https://t.co/5TRRDDm43W — Nick Ayers (@nick_ayers) July 28, 2017

Unlike the Preibus-Kelly shakeup, which took some by surprise, the vice president's change in staff lacks similar drama and intrigue.

Pence's office announced in late June that Ayers, a longtime political operative from Georgia who advised Pence during the 2016 campaign and while he served as Indiana governor, would in August replace Josh Pitcock.

""I am pleased to welcome Nick Ayers to the Office of the Vice President,"" Pence said in a statement at the time. ""During my years as Governor, then as a candidate and serving as Vice President, I have come to appreciate Nick's friendship, keen intellect and integrity and I couldn’t be more excited to have him come to the White House as my Chief of Staff. I am sincerely grateful to him, and his wife Jamie, for their willingness to serve our office and this administration.""

And Ayers, who has been a leader of the pro-Trump outside group America First Policies, said, ""I have such deep respect and admiration for the Pence’s and believe so deeply in the policies the Vice President and the President are fighting for. Leaving Georgia –- albeit temporarily -– was only possible because of how important my wife and I believe this mission is. I am honored with the trust the Vice President has in me and excited to serve in this capacity.""

As for Pitcock, who served as a top aide to Pence while he served in Congress and as governor, Pence said, ""Josh Pitcock's more than twelve years of service have played an invaluable role throughout my public career. His professionalism and integrity are unmatched and he will be missed. I will always be grateful for the foundation Josh laid in the Office of the Vice President and wish him every success in his future endeavors. Whatever the future holds for Josh and his family, he will remain one of my most trusted advisors and cherished friends.""

Pitcock cited a desire to transition to the private sector for his departure. ""Deciding to leave was not easy, but I believe the time is right for me to transition to the private sector,"" he said. ""Nick and I have worked seamlessly together for years and will continue to do so through the transition and thereafter."""
http://abcnews.go.com/International/us-detects-north-korean-missile-launch/story?id=48908129,go,North Korea fired intercontinental ballistic missile,"['Abc News', 'Emily Shapiro', 'Julia Jacobo', 'More Luis', 'More Emily', 'More Julia']","An initial assessment shows that North Korea fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) today that flew for more than 40 minutes, traveling 620 miles horizontally into the Sea of Japan, a U.S. official said.

""The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) determined the missile launch from North Korea did not pose a threat to North America,"" Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said in a statement.

The launch was detected at about 10:41 a.m. ET (11:41 p.m. local time).

On Saturday morning local time, the U.S. and South Korea fired short-range missiles into the Sea of Japan ""as a show of force"" in response to North Korea's launch, the U.S. military said in a statement.

The missile was launched near an arms plant from Mupyong-ni, in the far north of North Korea, and traveled about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) before splashing down in the Sea of Japan. The landing was inside of Japan’s Economic Exclusion Zone, about 88 nautical miles west of Hokkaido. Davis said the missile was in the air for at least 40 minutes.

""Our commitment to the defense of our allies, including the Republic of Korea and Japan, in the face of these threats, remains ironclad. We remain prepared to defend ourselves and our allies from any attack or provocation,"" Davis said.

In a statement, President Donald Trump condemned the launch, saying that North Korea's ""second such test in less than a month"" is the ""latest reckless and dangerous action"" by Kim Jong Un's regime.

KRT via AP Video

""The United States condemns this test and rejects the regime’s claim that these tests — and these weapons — ensure North Korea’s security,"" Trump said. ""In reality, they have the opposite effect. By threatening the world, these weapons and tests further isolate North Korea, weaken its economy, and deprive its people.""

Trump also said the U.S. will take ""all necessary steps to ensure the security of the American homeland and protect our allies in the region.""

Following today’s missile launch, Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Adm. Harry Harris of the U.S. Pacific Command called South Korea’s top military officer to express their iron-clad commitments to the U.S.-South Korean security alliance and to discuss military response options, David said.

Today's ballistic missile launch is North Korea’s 11th ballistic missile test this year and the first since North Korea launched an historic ICBM on July 4, an action U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said represented ""a new escalation of the threat to the United States, our allies and partners, the region and the world.""

That ICBM flew at a trajectory of 1,730 miles above Earth for 37 minutes before crashing into the Sea of Japan.

A U.S. official told ABC News earlier this week that North Korea could test another ICBM as early as Wednesday night.

U.S. officials had suspected a test could occur on July 27 to mark the North Korean holiday known as ""Day of Victory,"" which celebrates the end of hostilities in the Korean War in 1953.

But rainy weather at the launch location and technical difficulties appeared to have prevented a launch until late Friday night."
http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/excessive-cellphone-anxiety-experts-warn/story?id=48842476,go,"Excessive cellphone use may cause anxiety, experts warn",['Abc News'],"Spending too much time on your phone may be causing you to feel stress and anxiety, experts are warning.

""The more people use their phone,"" Dr. Nancy Cheever, who spearheaded research on the relationship between cellphone use and anxiety at California State University, Dominguez Hills, told ABC News, ""the more anxious they are about using their phone.""

Cheever's research suggests that phone-induced anxiety operates on a positive feedback loop, saying that phones keep us in a persistent state of anxiety and the only relief from this anxiety is to look at our phones.

She warns that there is little known about the long-term effects that phone-induced anxiety can have on your overall health.

""If you're constantly connected, you're going to feel anxiety,"" Cheever said. ""And the more people feel anxiety, that can lead to other things like mental health and physical ailments."" Her research comes at a time when teens may be on their phones for more than six-and-a-half hours a day, according to the nonprofit Common Sense Media.

Cheever demonstrated her experiment on ABC News' T.J. Holmes, as well as two teenage girls, measuring the amount of stress that being away from their phones caused them.

She initially told Holmes, as well as the two teens, that they were going to take part in an experiment on test anxiety, and then strapped measuring equipment to them to track changes in heart rate and even record perspiration levels.

ABC News

""I'm just going to put your phones back here because they might interfere with the equipment a little bit,"" Cheever told her subjects, moving their cellphones out of reach but still within hearing distance if the phones started to ring.

Cheever then sent text messages and called their phone numbers, and as their cellphones started to go off, Cheever used her equipment to measure their stress levels. Most people experience an emotional response that floods their body with stress hormones when they hear their phone go off, according to Cheever.

""His physiological arousal spikes quite a bit right after he hears the text come in,"" Cheever told ABC News of Holmes' reaction to hearing his phone go off.

""You could see immediately he ... started sweating quite a bit. He's anxious about his phone ringing,"" Cheever added.

The two teenage girls, Keke and Gabby, also responded with symptoms of stress and anxiety when their phones were taken away from them during the experiment and they could hear them ring. Keke's stress levels on Cheever's equipment measured four times higher than Holmes' levels. Meanwhile, Gabby had the highest stress response out of all three of them.

Nancy Colier, a psychotherapist and author of the book, ""The Power of Off,"" emphasized to ABC News that the long-term dangers of this anxiety remain largely unknown.

""Let's meet in 30 years,"" Colier said when asked how much damage is being done to a child who goes through these levels of anxiety every day, ""and we'll know the answer to that.""

""My experience in talking to teenagers is if it's 'My heart rate is higher' versus 'I have a social life,' they're going to choose social life,"" Colier added. ""But the way we're living doesn't actually serve our deeper well-being.""

""All of this attention to technology, and the mind, and thoughts is coming at a great expense to the other aspects of what ... human beings need to feel well,"" she said."

http://abcnews.go.com/Health/angelina-jolies-diagnosis-bells-palsy/story?id=48870459,go,Angelina Jolie's new diagnosis: What to know about Bell's palsy,"['Abc News', 'Dr. Nicole Van Groningen']","In a newly released interview with Vanity Fair, actress Angelina Jolie opens up about her struggle with Bell’s palsy, a rare and often mysterious neurologic condition.

The Oscar-winning actress, who split from longtime husband Brad Pitt in late 2016, expressed concern that in caring for her six children post-divorce, she let her own health decline. Jolie reported turning to acupuncture for relief from Bell’s palsy and noted that she has since made a full recovery.

Here's what you need to know about the rare neurologic disease.

What is Bell’s palsy?

Bell’s palsy is a condition that leads to paralysis of the facial nerve, the peripheral nerve responsible for facial movement. Sufferers develop one-sided facial weakness -- generally over a matter of hours or days -- that can result in eyebrow sagging, inability to close the eye and drooping at the corner of the mouth. Other symptoms may include sensitivity to loud noise, ear pain on the side of paralysis and an impaired sense of taste. Because of the physical abnormalities the condition causes, many affected people experience significant psychological distress and restrict their social activities. The condition is relatively rare, affecting only about 40,000 Americans each year.

Are certain people at higher risk?

Pregnancy is the most well-established risk factor. Bell’s palsy occurs three times more frequently in pregnant women than in the general population, particularly in the third trimester and the first week after delivery. People with diabetes also appear to be disproportionately affected by the condition. But when it comes to race and gender, there are no apparent differences in risk.

What causes Bell’s palsy?

The exact cause of Bell’s palsy is unknown. Most scientists believe there is a strong link between Bell’s palsy and viral infections such as influenza, herpes simplex or respiratory tract infections. Conditions that have been associated with Bell’s palsy include high blood pressure, immunodeficiency, sarcoidosis, tumors, Lyme disease and trauma, such as skull fracture or facial injury.

What’s the most common treatment?

The treatment of Bell's palsy may vary based on the severity of symptoms. Bell's palsy generally has an excellent prognosis, and recovery -- even without treatment -- is fairly common. However, sometimes medications and other therapeutic options are necessary. The goals of treatment are to improve facial nerve function, reduce nerve damage and protect the eye. Most common treatment includes prednisone, antiviral agents such as acyclovir -- normally used to treat herpetic infections -- and eye care to prevent corneal drying, abrasion and ulcers.

Other therapies such as facial massage or acupuncture may provide improvement with facial nerve function and pain, albeit to a small degree.

On rare occasions, surgery may be needed to help relieve symptoms.

http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/lifetime-movie-flint-dramatizes-citys-water-crisis-48920547,go,Lifetime movie 'Flint' dramatizes city's water crisis,['Abc News'],"Melissa Mays, a resident of Flint, Michigan, came armed to discuss the city's tainted water crisis and a new Lifetime TV movie dramatizing it.

Mays, speaking to a TV critics' meeting Friday, pointed to several bottles she had filled with her tap water and challenged the room to taste or even smell it. There were no immediate takers.

The activist, who said the battle over water safety continues, is among the residents portrayed in Lifetime's movie titled ""Flint,"" debuting Oct. 28. Mays is played by Marin Ireland, who co-stars with Betsy Brandt, Jill Scott and Queen Latifah.

Executive producer Neil Meron said the film is intended to spotlight what happened in Flint, including how a united community and ""the voice of the people"" can force officials to act.

Mays said there have been successes, including the outcome of a lawsuit to get half of the service lines replaced, although not the main lines or interior plumbing.

""So one of the things we hope come out of this is to let people know it's still not over. It's not even close to over,"" she said. The movie is intended to honor Flint victims by telling the story ""that even in a poor, broken, poisoned town, we banded together, and we fought. We fought, and we win.""

In 2014, a switch of Flint's water source and failure to add corrosion-reducing phosphates allowed lead from old pipes to leach into the water. Elevated levels of lead, a neurotoxin, were detected in children, and 12 people died in a Legionnaires' disease outbreak that experts suspect was linked to the improperly treated water.

An ongoing investigation has led to charges against 13 current or former government officials, including two managers who Republican Gov. Rick Snyder appointed to run the city.

Last January, state officials said Flint's water system no longer has lead levels exceeding the federal limit. The announcement was promptly met by skepticism from some residents, Mays among them, maintaining the system still contains lead and continues to cause illness.

Brandt, the former ""Breaking Bad"" star who's a native of Bay City, Michigan, not far from Flint, said the person she portrays, LeeAnne Walters, was among those driven to act when authorities failed to heed complaints about their children becoming ill.

""As a mom, it just shakes you, because there's some things that we just should be able to count on,"" Brandt said."

It has been reprinted here with permission. The Walt Disney Co. is the parent company of both ABC News and Babble.)

I once saw a kid at my daughter’s school eating cucumber slices. CUCUMBER SLICES. Kids don’t eat cucumbers. That’s not a thing. Pickles, maybe. But not cucumber slices.

Every mom has that one chore they hate doing. Me? I detest packing lunches. (I hate putting away laundry too, but you can always procrastinate until your couch appears to be made out of laundry piles.) Lunches require immediate action. Every. Single. Day.

There’s never a good time to pack lunch, is there? If you’re on your parenting game, you’re packing it the night before when you’re exhausted from dinner and dishes and you just want 10 minutes to yourself already. I mean, is 10 minutes so much to ask?!

Hi, My Name Is Serge and I’m a Lunchbox Notes Junkie

There May Be Chemicals in Mac & Cheese, So We’re Officially Out of Things to Feed Our Kids

Goldfish Crackers — and 8 Other Foods I Hate Now That I’m a Parent

Yes. Yes, it is too much to ask. You just finished dinner dishes, but you’ve got tomorrow’s lunch to make, MOM. Also, can you do some laundry? Because someone can’t find their favorite Pokemon T-shirt.

If you’re anything like me, you’re frantically slamming lunches together in the midst of the brutal morning routine when you’re trying to get yourself ready, wake up kids, make breakfast, and shuffle everyone out the door in a timely fashion without tears. Too late, you’ve already cried. Twice.

I suppose it’s glaringly apparent I’m not artfully carving adorable vegetable people with raisins for eyes that I delicately place in carefully curated Bento boxes. I am not that mom. Hell, I’m not even friends with that mom. But it’s not just because I don’t have the time to craft artisanal lunches. It’s because I actually want my kids to eat the food I put in their lunch bags — and a “creative” carrot stick is still a carrot stick my kid ain’t eating.

Before you shake your shamer-finger in my direction, you should know I gave healthy lunches my best shot. I started with a tiny Tupperware container brimming with ranch dressing in the hopes that, much like the gratuitous salads I sometimes serve with their dinners at home, the kids would use the accompanying carrot sticks as a ranch-to-mouth delivery mechanism. Alas, the sad sticks returned, withered and untouched. Celery and peanut butter didn’t fare much better. Upon unpacking lunch bags at the end of the day, I’d note that, while the peanut butter container was licked clean, I was throwing away four wilted celery sticks.

In an effort to curb the veritable vegetable massacre happening in my home, there was a brief foray into granola bar territory — but with similar results. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? I’d ask my notoriously picky daughter when the melty, smooshed granola bar would return in her lunch bag at end of the day. THERE ARE CHOCOLATE CHIPS IN HERE! A careless shrug met my lunch lamentations and I was left to peruse grocery store aisles, desperately holding aloft items for my kids’ inspection like a crazed “The Price Is Right” model: Raisins? You like raisins, right? I’d stroke the box temptingly. What about chocolate covered raisins? Oooh, these ones are covered in yogurt. What about yogurt? Applesauce? APPLESAUCE WITH CINNAMON? Why won’t you eat string cheese? WHAT IS WRONG WITH STRING CHEESE? C’MON, CHILD! WORK WITH YOUR MOTHER HERE.

Eventually, feeling as defeated as the brown bananas that returned in my son’s lunch bag, I gave up.

Here is what my kids eat: PB&J, chips/crackers/pretzels and a juice pouch. And maybe a package of fruit snacks. That counts as fruit, right? On a good day, I go all Donna Reed up in here and slice up some apples. But those aren’t for my kids. The apple slices are just an offering for their teachers and any other judgmental adults monitoring my kids’ lunches.

Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said in a statement the Trump administration will pursue its health care goals through regulation. ""This effort will continue,"" he said.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was among the Republicans who voted 'no.' There were gasps and applause from the Senate floor when McCain voted. The other Republicans who voted 'no' were Rep. Susan Collins of Maine and Rep. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.

In a statement released following the vote, McCain said, ""From the beginning, I have believed that Obamacare should be repealed and replaced with a solution that increases competition, lowers costs, and improves care for the American people. The so-called ‘skinny repeal’ amendment the Senate voted on today would not accomplish those goals.""

McCain added, ""While the amendment would have repealed some of Obamacare’s most burdensome regulations, it offered no replacement to actually reform our health care system and deliver affordable, quality health care to our citizens.""

McCain offered a plan going forward, saying, ""We must now return to the correct way of legislating and send the bill back to committee, hold hearings, receive input from both sides of aisle, heed the recommendations of nation’s governors, and produce a bill that finally delivers affordable health care for the American people. We must do the hard work our citizens expect of us and deserve.”

""We tried really hard,” Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on the Senate floor following the vote. ""A disappointment indeed ... I regret that our efforts were simply not enough this time.”

He said he imagines Democrats are celebrating, but ""American people are hurting and need relief."" He then blamed Democrats for not engaging with Republicans to help people “suffering under Obamacare.” He added, ""Now I think it’s appropriate to ask what are their ideas. It’ll be interesting to see what they suggest as the way forward.""

“Bailing out insurance companies with no thought of any kind of reform is not something I want to be part of and I suspect that not many folks over here that are interested in that,” McConnell said, drawing the line on the potential bipartisan road ahead. “But it’ll be interesting to see what they have in mind.”

“I regret that we’re here, but I’m proud of the vote I cast tonight,” McConnell said. ""It’s consistent with what we told the American people we’d try to accomplish in four straight elections if they gave us a chance."" He then ended his speech admitting it’s ""time to move on.""

He asked for unanimous consent for the Senate to meet at 10 a.m. on Friday and to proceed to HR 2810, the National Defense Authorization Bill. There was an objection.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer then took the mic and expressed his relief.

""I would suggest we turn the page,"" Schumer said. “We are not celebrating. We are relieved that millions and millions of people who would have been so drastically hurt…will at least retain their health care.”

He added, “We are relieved, not for ourselves, but for the American people.""

The vote came amidst the Senate's days-long debate in which it struggled to pass any option for repealing or replacing the Affordable Care Act. Two earlier attempts - one to pass a repeal-and-replace option, and another on a repeal-only measure - both failed Wednesday.

The bill that did not pass during the early hours of Friday morning is dubbed ""skinny"" repeal because of its limited scope. The text of the pared down bill, released just hours before the vote, revealed that it would scrap the individual mandate for insurance coverage, repeal the employer mandate for at least eight years and allow individuals to put more money in tax-exempt health savings accounts.

The bill also suspends a tax on medical devices and allows states to seek waivers from consumer protections in the Affordable Care Act.

An estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office showed that skinny repeal alone would leave 16 million more people uninsured than the current law over the next decade, and would raise premiums for some consumers by 20 percent.

At least four Republican senators had threatened to block the so-called skinny repeal proposal unless they have assurances from House Speaker Paul Ryan that it is only a placeholder and would not be passed in the House and sent to the president’s desk. They, and others, want this to serve a vehicle for the next step of negotiations between the House and the Senate.

""The skinny bill as policy is a disaster. The skinny bill as a replacement for Obamacare is a fraud,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said. He said he could support the bill, but warned of the dire consequences if it was allowed to become law.

Graham said he has had conversations with Freedom Caucus chair Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., in which Meadows has warned him that House Majority Whip Steve Scalise has apparently been telling ""some"" people that the House will just take up the skinny repeal and pass it and put it on the president's desk.

""I need assurances that it will not be the final product,"" Sen. Graham went on during a press conference Thursday. Graham said he worried about rumors that House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, who has been recovering from a gunshot wound but was released from the hospital this week, was considering bringing the narrow repeal bill up for a vote as is.

Amid the negotiations Thursday evening, House Speaker Paul Ryan opened the door for the Senate proposal to be considered in a conference committee with House lawmakers, giving the Senate efforts a much-needed boost.

""It is now obvious that the only path ahead is for the Senate to pass the narrow legislation that it is currently considering,” Ryan’s statement read. “Senators have made clear that this is an effort to keep the process alive, not to make law. If moving forward requires a conference committee, that is something the House is willing to do.""

As the possibility of the Senate passing a partial repeal bill loomed Thursday, several patient, hospital and insurance groups put out statements arguing that scrapping even just the mandate that individuals buy insurance could have real consequences for health care marketplaces.

Blue Cross wrote in statement: “A system that allows people to purchase coverage only when they need it drives up costs for everyone.”

America's Health Insurance Plans CEO Marilyn B. Tavenner echoed their concern, writing in a statement: “We would oppose an approach that eliminates the individual coverage requirement, does not offer alternative continuous coverage solutions, and does not include measures to immediately stabilize the individual market.”

The AARP called it a “wolf in sheep’s clothing.” Citing a recent report from the Congressional Budget Office that predicted repealing even just the individual mandate could lead to 15 million more Americans uninsured in the next decade a 20 percent premium increase for folks buying their own insurance.

This increase in premium costs could lead to some people's being priced out of plans, or the federal government may aid those people through subsidies and tax credits.

The individual mandate provides social cost savers as well. If people don't have insurance and get sick, hospitals, taxpayers and local governments end up covering the costs. ""In the absence of a mandate, those social costs would probably increase relative to the case under current law,"" the CBO said in a report last December.

Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., indicated he would vote for a bare-bones package as long as it kept the process moving forward. ""We'll keep the process going. If we've got to do something less than obviously I'd want to keep the process going, we'll do it,"" he said.

Kevin Lewis, a spokesman for Obama, said in a statement Friday, “[The Affordable Care Act] is about the dreams protected, and the untold misery and ruin prevented. Today, it remains that way because of everyone who mobilized, organized and made their voices heard. The Affordable Care Act has made America stronger and healthier, but there will always be more work to do.”

The ACA helped to insure 20 million Americans and gave “tens of millions more” preventive care, such as mammograms and vaccines, the statement said.

But it also acknowledged the work ahead to guarantee the law's existence.

“President Obama has always said we should build on this law, just as members of both parties worked together to improve Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid over the years,” the statement said. “President Obama still believes that it is possible for Congress to demonstrate the necessary bipartisanship and political courage to keep delivering on the promise of quality, affordable health insurance for every American.”

Obama spoke out on Facebook after Senate Republicans released their health care bill in late June.

“Simply put, if there’s a chance you might get sick, get old, or start a family – this bill will do you harm,” he wrote.

Obama has repeatedly warned against taking away health care for millions of Americans now covered under the ACA and urged Republicans and Democrats to work together.

It might “take some time and compromise between Democrats and Republicans,” Obama said in June. “But I believe that’s what people want to see. I believe it would demonstrate the kind of leadership that appeals to Americans across party lines.”

The ACA, also known as Obamacare, was signed into law on March 30, 2017. The bill passed without any Republican support and thus was largely criticized by Republicans. High premiums and deductibles along with arguments of government overreach stoked opposition to the law.

But protests erupted when plans to repeal and replace were first announced in March as the House of Representatives unveiled the American Health Care Act, and millions of Americans began to fear losing their health care coverage.

For now, Obamacare remains."

Cena the 10-year-old black lab received a hero's farewell Wednesday before being euthanized at the USS LST 393, a museum ship in Muskegon, and carried off in a flag-draped coffin.

Cena, who was recently diagnosed with terminal bone cancer, was a bomb-sniffer for the Marines until his retirement in 2014. The celebration for Cena was organized by his owner, Lance Cpl. Jeff Young, who was paired with the dog in 2009 and 2010 while on a combat tour in Afghanistan and who adopted him in 2014. Cena then became DeYoung's service dog to help him with his post-traumatic stress disorder.

""My whole adult life I've had Cena,"" DeYoung said. ""When I was 19 overseas learning how to be responsible, I had Cena. And now I'm 27 and I'm having to say goodbye to one of the biggest pieces of my life.""

DeYoung said he has carried Cena across rivers and thrown his body over him while under heavy fire from the Taliban. He said Cena kept DeYoung's body warm during cold desert nights, and comforted him when he lost seven friends in three weeks.

As part of the celebration, DeYoung took his dog on one last ride in a topless Jeep that was decorated and named ""Cancer Response Team.""

""It started off with my basically wanting to go to a dealership and wanting to borrow a Jeep for a day and really small to a community tribute or a community parade for him and he's truly deserved it all,"" DeYoung said. ""The support, all the love people are giving him, he can see it and he can feel it.""

The ceremony was attended by the U.S. Marine Corps League, Michigan State Police, Muskegon County Sheriff's Office, Muskegon City Police, Muskegon Fire Department and officers from several other departments, including a canine officer named Rex. Attendees gave one final three-volley salute with ""Taps"" playing in the background for Cena, who was wearing a decorated blue Marine vest.

""Lord, it is with heavy hearts that we are sending another Marine to you today,"" said chaplain Wesley Spyke as he addressed the crowd in prayer.

A GoFundMe page was set up for donations to help build a headstone for Cena.

""Any dog that served overseas deserves exactly what I've done for Cena, if not more,"" DeYoung said.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/north-carolina-town-forgotten-residents-jobs-fall-48924346,go,"North Carolina town 'forgotten' as residents, jobs fall away",['Abc News'],"Tucked away in northeastern North Carolina is Bertie County —a rural, primarily black community in one of the state's poorest areas with many of its fastest-shrinking towns.

There are plenty of pothole-marked roads, mobile homes, and overgrown lots of weeds and shrubs scattered among fields of tobacco, cotton and sage. But there aren't many stores, banks or other businesses.

""This part of the state is forgotten,"" said Larry Drew, mayor of Aulander, a town that has seen its population drop by over 9 percent, from 895 people in 2010 to 813 in 2016. And last year, it lost its largest employer — a peanut factory.

Aulander isn't alone. Bertie County is home to seven of North Carolina's top 10 towns with the biggest percentage decline in residents from 2015 to 2016, according to data from the UNC Carolina Population Center.

And further population decrease is expected as more people are dying there than are being born, and more people are moving away, the center said.

The South's large cities, those with at least 50,000 people, grew by 1.3 percent from 2015 to 2016, figures from the U.S. Census Bureau showed. Towns with populations under 5,000 grew only 0.2 percent, and a lot of that growth came in neighborhoods on the edges of bigger metropolitan areas, experts said.

For small, rural towns it's a story repeated throughout the nation: Young adults tend to leave and relocate to areas that offer better employment and educational opportunities.

They tend to raise their families where they move, so there are fewer children in these places. In Bertie County, 19 percent of its population is 65 years or older, compared with 16 percent statewide.

In Bertie County, industries that once thrived — several lumber mills and a herring packing plant in Colerain, for example — are now shuttered. With an economy that relies heavily on agriculture, there are limited good-paying jobs for residents, about a third of who officials estimate live below the poverty line. The county's largest employers include a Perdue chicken processing plant, which has about 2,000 workers, and a nearby state prison.

And as more people leave, tax revenue drops, making it difficult for small towns to provide services, said Rebecca Tippett of the Carolina Population Center.

Lewiston-Woodville, population 494, has seen a 10 percent drop of 55 people in six years, the steepest in North Carolina. The western town has had trouble staffing emergency services positions, officials said. One of its commissioners, James Pugh, serves as a volunteer firefighter, and just recently, the town swore in its only police officer after going without one for some time.

A lack of decent cellphone reception and internet service can deter businesses from moving to these areas, said Ken Johnson, a demographer at the Carsey School of Public Policy and professor at the University of New Hampshire.

""Twenty years ago, the question might have been 'are roads good enough?' Now, the first questions potential employers are asking are 'what's the internet service like?'"" Johnson said.

Not all small towns are struggling. Those on the outskirts of metro areas have done reasonably well thanks to their proximity to larger cities that allows people to be closer to their jobs, shopping, hospitals and recreation, Johnson said.

Despite its challenges, Bertie County officials said they're committed to revitalization and have purchased a waterfront property, which it plans to use as a beach and recreational area. Its community center, The Hive House — with school programming, a technology and education center with Wi-Fi, and a food pantry — is being renovated. There's a fairly new high school equipped with the latest technology, and plans for a new interstate between Norfolk and Raleigh have officials predicting an economic boost.

Regardless of data projections, experts say there will always be a place for small towns because they offer something most larger areas don't: a sense of community.

""Everyone knows everyone and will come to someone's help if needed,"" Johnson said.

Leslie Briley, 24, who grew up in Roxobel, a town of 220 people in northwestern Bertie County, returned after graduating college in Wilson to help care for her aging grandfather and now works at a growing family-owned peanut business.

""I've known people in the past who have worked here. And it's just a small, little place, but I saw the potential and the growth — and I was happy to be a part of it,"" said Briley who is helping her grandfather with the company.

While she's hopeful about the town's future, Briley — who plans to stick around and is considering buying a house nearby — said young people need more things to do if they're going to stay.

""Right now you kind of just pass through Roxobel,"" Briley said. There's not much, but if we can have events, new stores ... make it an interesting place to be.

""I love small towns,"" she said of why she'll stay. ""I like the small community and helping be part of things."""

SMART PERSPECTIVE

Elizabeth Smart said it required years for her to participate in a movie about her kidnapping ordeal.

Smart said Friday that she couldn't have done so immediately after her abduction from her Salt Lake City home in 2002 at age 14. She was rescued nine months later, and said Friday she was eager to ""run away"" from the experience.

Even as an adult, Smart said it took time and serious discussion with producers for her to agree to work on Lifetime's ""I Am Elizabeth Smart.""

Smart said she began to realize that such a project could make a difference. She narrates the drama, which stars newcomer Alana Boden as Smart and Skeet Ulrich as her abductor.

""I will say that it is the best worst movie I've ever seen. I mean, I think it's so well done. I think it was accurate,"" she said. ""I'm very proud of it, but at the same time, part of me thinks I'll be happy if I never have to watch it again.

Smart took advantage of her appearance at a TV critics' meeting to promote AMBER Alert, designed to help locate missing children with alerts distributed through media, email and other means. Smart asked that promote the system and activate it on their smart phones.

""I Am Elizabeth Smart"" debuts Nov. 18 on Lifetime, preceded by a two-part documentary on Nov. 12 and 13 that Lifetime said will include new information on the case and detail Smart's life today.

A ripped-from-the-headlines TV movie about the crime, ""The Elizabeth Smart Story,"" aired in 2003.

Brian David Mitchell, a Utah street preacher, was convicted of kidnapping and raping Smart and sentenced to life in prison.

FLINT'S FURY

Melissa Mays, a resident of Flint, Michigan, came armed to discuss the city's tainted water crisis and a new Lifetime TV movie dramatizing it.

Mays, speaking to a TV critics' meeting Friday, pointed to several bottles she had filled with her tap water and challenged the room to taste or even smell it. There were no immediate takers.

The activist, who said the battle over water safety continues, is among the residents portrayed in Lifetime's movie titled ""Flint,"" debuting Oct. 28. Mays is played by Marin Ireland, who co-stars with Betsy Brandt, Jill Scott and Queen Latifah.

Executive producer Neil Meron said the film is intended to spotlight what happened in Flint, including how a united community and ""the voice of the people"" can force officials to act.

Mays said there have been successes, including the outcome of a lawsuit to get half of the service lines replaced, although not the main lines or interior plumbing.

""So one of the things we hope come out of this is to let people know it's still not over. It's not even close to over,"" she said. The movie is intended to honor Flint victims by telling the story ""that even in a poor, broken, poisoned town, we banded together, and we fought. We fought, and we win.""

In 2014, a switch of Flint's water source and failure to add corrosion-reducing phosphates allowed lead from old pipes to leach into the water. Elevated levels of lead, a neurotoxin, were detected in children, and 12 people died in a Legionnaires' disease outbreak that experts suspect was linked to the improperly treated water.

An ongoing investigation has led to charges against 13 current or former government officials, including two managers who Republican Gov. Rick Snyder appointed to run the city.

Last January, state officials said Flint's water system no longer has lead levels exceeding the federal limit. The announcement was promptly met by skepticism from some residents, Mays among them, maintaining the system still contains lead and continues to cause illness.

Brandt, the former ""Breaking Bad"" star who's a native of Bay City, Michigan, not far from Flint, said the person she portrays, LeeAnne Walters, was among those driven to act when authorities failed to heed complaints about their children becoming ill.

""As a mom, it just shakes you, because there's some things that we just should be able to count on,"" Brandt said.

TIME FOR 'OUTLANDER'

The producers of ""Outlander"" don't expect the drama to outstrip the extensive series of novels it's based on.

Diana Gabaldon has published eight books about time-traveling British nurse Claire Randall, who finds love and adventure with Jamie Fraser in 18th-century Scotland.

Starz's ""Outlander,"" starring Caitriona Balfe, returns for its third season in September. Drawing on events in novel No. 3, ""Voyager,"" the series opens immediately after Claire lands back in her 1948 life. She's left behind Jamie, played by Sam Heughan.

At a TV critics' meeting Friday with Balfe and other cast members, producer Ronald Moore said he can't imagine a scenario where the series catches up with Gabaldon's work.

Fellow producer Maril Davis said they ""absolutely"" will keep making the show if Starz and studio Sony let them.

In a 3-0 decision, the court overturned decisions by a judge who said federal water law eclipsed claims of civil rights violations. The court said it wasn't judging the merits of the two lawsuits, but it's allowing residents to at least get inside the courthouse door.

The cases now return to U.S. District Judge John Corbett O'Meara in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

They are among many lawsuits in state and federal courts over the disastrous decision to use water from the Flint River without treating it for corrosion in 2014-15. The water caused lead to leach from pipes, contaminating Flint's water supply. Residents are seeking compensation for ""state-created danger.""

The Flint River was tapped while Flint was being run by state-appointed emergency managers because of chronic financial problems. The city has returned to a regional water system, and experts say the water is safe to drink if first run through a filter.

Separately, Michigan has agreed to spend as much as $97 million in state and federal money to replace water lines at 18,000 homes by 2020."

But when he showed up on his 80th birthday with his granddaughter on the way home from her swim practice, he got a special surprise.

The employees had gotten him balloons and a large vanilla cake celebrating their “#1 customer.”

“He was crying. He was so happy,” Johnson’s granddaughter, Emma Carr, told ABC News. “They all sang to him and told him, ‘Happy birthday.’ It was a really sweet moment.”

Carr said her grandpa has been lonely since his wife died in April of 2016, so he has befriended the staff.

“After she passed away, he moved into an apartment literally around the corner from this Whataburger,” Carr, 18, explained. “He was really lonely and did his best to get out of the house to make friends, so he’d come to Whataburger. He’s a natural extrovert and instantly made friends. There’s a group of regulars that come here all the time and they always meet. He made friends with all the workers as well. He considers every single member of the staff a part of his family. He loves them and they love him.”

Johnson said his late wife, Lola, wasn’t a big fan of fast food because “she liked to do her own cooking.""

But after her death, he said his regular breakfast order helped him connect with other people.

“I drive up at the Whataburger and my food is ready before I even get up to the register to pay for it,” he said. “The lady that does most of the cooking, if I don’t show up by a certain time, she starts asking the other staff where I am.”

Carr's photos of the touching surprise for her grandpa quickly went viral on social media, and the burger chain even weighed in on Twitter.

Carr said there wasn’t a dry eye in the restaurant on her grandpa's birthday.

“I cried, he cried, everyone cried,” she said. “It was a really special moment because he’s super humble and puts everyone above himself.

ALLEGATION: Claims by dozens of employees that former Yosemite Superintendent Don Neubacher had created a toxic work environment were revealed last September during congressional hearings examining widespread reports of misconduct in the park system. An investigation by the Interior Department's inspector general released in April said dozens of employees reported witnessing Neubacher undermine the competence or performance of employees, ridiculing ideas as ""dopey"" or ""stupid"" or saying they would make park managers ""look like bozos."" The report also said Neubacher had showed bias against women.

FALLOUT: Neubacher retired in September. He denied harassing employees or creating a hostile work environment.

GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK

ALLEGATION: A January 2016 report by the inspector general said male employees at the Grand Canyon preyed on female colleagues during what could be weeks-long trips on the Colorado River. Investigators said the men demanded sex and retaliated against women who refused and that former Superintendent Dave Uberuaga and his deputy failed to properly investigate or report allegations of misconduct.

FALLOUT: Uberuaga retired in June 2016 after declining an offer to transfer to another position with the park service in Washington, D.C. The park unit that ran river trips was dismantled and some of its duties contracted out. Employees presented a plan to reinstate the unit earlier this month that includes a proposal for a new operations manager to oversee the unit and report directly to the superintendent.

CANAVERAL NATIONAL SEASHORE

ALLEGATION: Investigators found Canaveral's chief ranger, Edwin Correa, sexually harassed three employees over five years.

FALLOUT: Correa was no longer an employee of the park service as of May 12, the agency said Friday.

INTERIOR DEPARTMENT LAW ENFORCEMENT CHIEF

ALLEGATION: An inspector general's investigation released in February said Interior Department Director of Law Enforcement and Security Tim Lynn acted inappropriately toward at least six female employees by touching and hugging them and making flirtatious remarks. At least one employee said Lynn retaliated against her. Lynn acknowledged some of the allegations but said he had not meant to make the women uncomfortable.

FALLOUT: Lynn retired in April after the results of investigation were made public."

ABC's INES DE LA CUETARA: Speaking to reporters after his rally in Andover, Minnesota, Marco Rubio said this might not be such a great night for Donald Trump.





""We’re gonna have a lot of delegates after tonight and you’re gonna see very clearly after tonight that Donald Trump has no chance of ever getting the delegates he needs to be the nominee,"" he said.









He also said it might also be a rough night for Cruz.





""This was supposed to be Ted Cruz’s day. This was the day where he said he was going to bring an end to the campaign, Super Tuesday, he was going to sweep the South. I don’t think that’s going to happen -- it’s pretty clear now, and so I think he has big problems as he faces that,"" he said.











""If you can’t sweep up Super Tuesday where else in this country are you going to get a big showing? Because it only gets worse from here for him. It only gets better for us and I feel good about it,"" he went on.





But said that Cruz ""has a right to stay in this as long as he wants to,"" even if he loses Texas.





Finally gave some specifics about what states he hoped to do well in.





""We feel great about Minnesota we feel great about Virginia we feel great about a bunch of them,"" he said, adding he was confident they would get a lot of delegates.





Asked if he thought he could finish ahead of Ted Cruz in a majority of the states tonight, he said ""we'll see.""

""I certainly think we’re going to do a lot better than we’re expected to do tonight,"" he said.

Although Florida doesn't hold its primary until March 15, Rubio feels confident he'll win his homestate.

http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/jury-michael-jackson-estate-owes-quincy-jones-94-48873589,go,Jury: Michael Jackson estate owes Quincy Jones $9.4 million,['Abc News'],"A jury on Wednesday found that Michael Jackson's estate owes Quincy Jones $9.4 million in royalties and production fees from ""Billie Jean,"" ''Thriller"" and more of the superstar's biggest hits.

The award from a Los Angeles Superior Court jury fell short of the $30 million the legendary producer sought in the lawsuit filed nearly four years ago, but well above the approximately $392,000 the Jackson estate contended Jones was owed.

The jury of 10 women and two men had been deliberating since Monday.

""This lawsuit was never about Michael, it was about protecting the integrity of the work we all did in the recording studio and the legacy of what we created,"" Jones wrote in a statement. ""Although this (judgment) is not the full amount that I was seeking, I am very grateful that the jury decided in our favor in this matter. I view it not only as a victory for myself personally, but for artists' rights overall.""

Estate attorney Howard Weitzman said he and his team were surprised by the verdict and would appeal it.

Weitzman and co-counsel Zia Modabber wrote in a statement that Jones was seeking money that wasn't owed to him.

""Any amount above and beyond what is called for in his contracts is too much and unfair to Michael's heirs,"" the lawyers said. ""Although Mr. Jones is portraying this is a victory for artists' rights, the real artist is Michael Jackson and it is his money Mr. Jones is seeking.""

Jones claimed in the lawsuit that Jackson's estate and Sony Music Entertainment owed him for music he had produced that was used in the concert film ""This Is It"" and two Cirque du Soleil shows that used Jackson's songs.

The lawsuit said the entities had improperly re-edited the songs to deprive Jones of royalties and production fees, and that he had a contractual right to take first crack at any re-edit or remix.

The Jackson camp held that Jones should only be paid licensing fees for songs used in those three productions. Jones claimed he was entitled to a share of the overall receipts from them.

The trial centered on the definitions of terms in the two contracts Jackson and Jones signed in 1978 and 1985.

Under the deals, for example, Jones is entitled to a share of net receipts from a ""videoshow"" of the songs. The Jackson attorneys argued that the term was meant to apply to music videos and not feature films.

Jury foreman Duy Nguyen, 28, said the contracts were the strongest pieces of evidence the jury considered, and said hearing Jones' testimony was also helpful.

He said he and many members of the jury are Jackson fans, but that didn't factor into the deliberations. He said the verdict amount was a compromise figure based on an expert's testimony.

Jones took the stand during the trial, and was asked by Jackson estate attorney Howard Weitzman whether he realized he was essentially suing Jackson himself.

Jones angrily disagreed.

""I'm not suing Michael,"" he said. ""I'm suing you all.""

The defense attorneys pointed out that Jackson's death in 2009 has already been lucrative for Jones, who made $8 million from his share of their works in the two years after the singer's death, versus $3 million in the two years previous.

""You don't deserve a raise,"" Weitzman said during closing arguments. ""You can't have any more of Michael Jackson's money.""

Jones insisted he was seeking his due for the work he has done rather than merely seeking money.

His attorney Scott Cole accused the defense of using ""word games and loopholes"" to deny Jones, the Hollywood Reporter said.

The producer worked with Jackson on the three-album run widely considered the performer's prime: ""Off the Wall,"" ''Thriller"" and ""Bad.""

Jackson's hits from those albums including ""Billie Jean,"" ''Thriller"" and ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"" are among the songs Jones claims were re-edited.

The lawsuit initially set the amount Jones sought at least $10 million, but his attorneys later arrived at $30 million after an accounting of the estate's profits from the works.

Jones and Jackson proved to be a perfect partnership starting with 1979's ""Off the Wall."" Jackson gave a youthful pop vitality to Jones, who was known primarily as a producer and arranger of jazz and film soundtracks. And Jones lent experience and gravitas to Jackson, who was still best known to most as the child prodigy who fronted the Jackson 5.

http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/priest-boston-sex-abuse-scandal-released-prison-48913248,go,Ex-priest in Boston sex abuse scandal released from prison,['Abc News'],"A defrocked priest at the center of Boston's Roman Catholic clergy sex abuse scandal was released from prison on Friday and settled into an apartment across the street from a children's dance studio.

Paul Shanley, who had been convicted of raping a boy in the 1980s, moved to the town of Ware, about 65 miles (105 kilometers) west of Boston, after being released from the Old Colony Correctional Center in Bridgewater, where he completed a 12-year sentence. Shanley, 86, used a cane and was helped by a man as he arrived in Ware, followed by a group of reporters and photographers.

His new home in a multiunit building is across from a recently opened dance studio that teaches children as young as 2. The studio's owner, Arielle Lask, said she plans to install ""state-of-the-art"" security systems and to make sure every child leaves the studio accompanied by an adult.

""It's awful that he's even on the streets of Ware,"" Lask told The Boston Globe. ""Whether it's across the street or down the road, there are children everywhere.""

As a condition of Shanley's 10-year probation, he has been ordered to have no contact with children under age 16.

Ware police Chief Shawn Crevier said Shanley has registered as a sex offender and posters will be displayed around town notifying the public that Shanley is living in the area, which is typical procedure for the police department.

""We're going to do what we need to do to make sure the citizens are protected and his rights are also protected,"" Crevier said.

Shanley will be at least the third sex offender living on his street, he said.

Prosecutors sought to hold Shanley beyond his criminal sentence under a law that allows civil commitment of people deemed sexually dangerous. But two psychologists hired by the state found he did not meet the legal criteria to hold him.

A lawyer who represented Shanley in his criminal appeal said he's confident Shanley will not harm anyone. But attorney Robert Shaw Jr. said he understands the reaction from those who opposed Shanley's release from prison.

""I'm sure that law enforcement will ensure that the community feels safe, and I have every expectation that they are going to fulfill their obligation and be certain that Paul Shanley also remains safe,"" Shaw said.

The state's sex offender registry designates Shanley as a Level 3 offender, considered the most likely to reoffend. But the two psychologists cited Shanley's advanced age and his health issues and concluded his likelihood to reoffend is low.

Attorney Mitchell Garabedian, who represented dozens of men who say they were abused by Shanley, said the evaluations were incomplete because the psychologists didn't interview Shanley. Instead, they reviewed police reports, prosecutors' files and Shanley's church personnel file containing numerous sexual abuse complaints against him.

""Paul Shanley should be in a hospital being treated and not in the outside world where he can easily gain access to innocent children,"" Garabedian said.

Both psychologists found Shanley meets the psychiatric criteria for pedophilic disorder. But they said research suggests recidivism rates for people of his age are extremely low. They also cited Shanley's health issues, which were blacked out from the reports, and the fact his last reported offense was in 1990.

Shanley was a street priest who ministered to alienated youths in the 1960s and '70s. Dozens of men came forward decades later and said Shanley had molested or raped them. He was defrocked by the Vatican in 2004 and was convicted of raping a boy at a Newton parish in 2005.

The archdiocese said this week it will not provide Shanley with financial support or benefits. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker said he will review the standards for civilly committing convicted sex offenders who have served their prison sentences.

Reporting by the Globe's Spotlight team helped break open the priest sex abuse scandal in the Archdiocese of Boston in 2002. The reporting uncovered how dozens of priests in the archdiocese had molested and raped children for decades while church higher-ups covered it up and shuffled abusive priests from parish to parish.

A movie about the Globe's reporting, called ""Spotlight,"" won the 2016 Academy Award for best picture.

There’s plenty beyond the beach here, from the arts to the outdoors, and there’s a year-round affordability factor that gives Myrtle Beach wide appeal.

If you’re planning a visit to this South Carolina hot spot, here’s what you should do.

Skip the Sand, Cruise the Boardwalk Myrtle Beach’s famous boardwalk is the area’s entertainment epicenter. It’s well renowned: built in 2010, the 1.2-mile wooden promenade was named one of America’s best by National Geographic. Its towering SkyWheel juts 200 feet above the beach, featuring 42 glass-enclosed observation gondolas and lighting up the sky in multicolored neon. And this is where you bring the family for a meal, a little shopping and a lot of fun, from Ripley’s 5D Moving Theater to the Nightmare Haunted House. Summer visits will offer extra experiences, from live music concerts throughout the week to a Kids’ Carnival on Monday nights.

Come hangout on The Avenue brand new to Broadway at the Beach! pic.twitter.com/zUiFubLW6H — VacationMyrtleBeach (@VacationMB) July 12, 2017

Don’t Walk, Fly For a spectacular view of the Grand Strand, take off with Helicopter Adventures, which offers several tours by chopper starting at $20 per person. The Boardwalk Adventure ($40) covers eight miles and offers a unique view of the Boardwalk below; splurge on the Grand Adventure ($180) and cover more than 40 miles of white sandy beach and attractions, including the sweeping shores of North Myrtle Beach. For more adventures up high, go parasailing 500 feet above the ocean with Downwind Sails or take on a three-level rope course more than 60 feet above the ground with Myrtle Beach Zipline Adventures.

Skip Vegas, Take a Cruise Myrtle Beach is home to the only casino cruises in South Carolina. The Big “M” Casino operates two luxury yachts that offer classic table games like Blackjack and Texas Hold ‘Em Poker and a slew of slot machines. There’s an optional all-you-can-eat buffet and live music on select sailings. Cruises last five hours and launch from Little River, a short drive north of Myrtle Beach; between hands, check out the scenic views of Little River Inlet.

Skip the Movies, Catch a Show “Spanning 350 acres, Broadway at the Beach is a massive entertainment complex that includes restaurants, shops and family entertainment,” says Annemarie Kropf, a Travelzoo deal expert. “One option is Legends in Concert, which features rotating tribute acts.” Tribute acts for 2017 feature doppelgangers for Dolly Parton, Tina Turner, Michael Jackson, Elvis, the Blues Brothers, Lady Gaga, Prince and Steven Tyler.

Skip the 18 Holes, Swing Smaller Steve Bertogli, a travel expert based in Travelzoo’s New York office, visits Myrtle Beach with his kids often. “Families have their choice of several miniature golf courses – there are so many to choose from along the Grand Strand,” he says. In fact, the town known as the seaside golf capital of the world for its 100-plus championship courses also boasts more than 50 putt-putt courses, perfect for kids or the young at heart. They’re all meticulously manicured and colorfully festooned, but each has its own theme. Find swashbuckling mini-golf action at Shipwreck Island Miniature Golf or put a little aloha in your swing at one of the area’s newest courses, Aloha Mini Golf.

Skip the Buzz, Head North “I'm a big fan of North Myrtle Beach,” adds Bertogli. “A little less congested, better restaurants, more upscale.” This laidback destination is where the shag was born, that roaring 1930s dance that still draws two-steppers to clubs along Ocean Drive. Hikers have lots of nature trail options here. And visit the Inlet Point Plantation, where you can take a galloping tour through this wild, historic property by day and a romantic moonlit horseback ride on the beach by night. Accommodation options in North Myrtle Beach range from fine hotels to beach home vacation rentals.

Skip the Milkshake, Sip the Wine A budding wine region exists just outside North Myrtle Beach, where muscadine reigns supreme. This decadent dessert wine has been produced in this area for centuries and you’ll find it on the menu at Duplin Winery and Carolina Vineyards, where guests can watch all the hustle and bustle of a working winery firsthand. La Belle Amie Vineyard in nearby Little River hosts music festivals year-round, and guests get half-off tastings every Wednesday.

After You Go North, Head South Ryan Haase, a New York-based Travelzoo travel deals expert, suggests heading south, where many Americans have summer homes. “Pawley’s Island and Murrells Inlet are small towns directly south of Myrtle Beach and they’re really lovely and away from the hubbub of the main strip,” he says. “There is a nice boardwalk in Murrells along the water that’s really small-scale and low-key, not the razzle dazzle you expect from Myrtle Beach main strip. A lot of the summer houses are up on stilts on the waterfront marshland, and in the middle will be a small pond with a gazebo. Really pretty backdrop for wedding photos.”

Skip the Water, Visit the Gardens Located in Murrells Inlet, Brookgreen Gardens is considered one of the top wildlife preserves in the country. The 9,100-acre property is a nature lover’s haven, with gardens that feature 300-year-old live oak trees, Sabal palmettos and seasonal blooms. There are beautiful original sculptures throughout. The new labyrinth overlooking an offshoot creek of the Waccamaw River houses interpretive panels highlighting local history. You can even sign up for horticulture classes. And the onsite zoo features a bevy of native animals – alligators, bald eagles, red foxes and white-tailed deer – and an aviary. Can’t see it all in one visit? No problem: admission is good for seven consecutive days, and each ticket you buy online saves you $1.

Want More Wild? TIGERS – The Institute of Greatly Endangered and Rare Species – draws tourists to its live tiger exhibit at Barefoot Landing; this visit is free, though the group also cares for dozens of big cats on a nearby 50-acre preserve, which you can tour for a fee. Nearby, Alligator Adventure's natural swamps house the rare albino alligator and exotic creatures like lizards and giant frogs. And to witness dolphins in their natural habitat, take a jet ski trip with Thomas Outdoor Watersports or a chartered expedition with Lowcountry and Plantation Tours.

Skip Summer, Go in Winter Thanks to vacation schedules, Myrtle Beach is most popular with families in summer. Haase, though, suggests visiting in the off-season. Recently “we went in February, when the town is quiet and the mild 60s weather were a nice change from Northeast frigidity,” he says. “Our resort was empty and prices were cheap, and it was still nice to wake up to a beach view, even in winter.”

Speaking on the second day of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, Huckabee declared that in the second term of the Obama presidency there is “not one country anywhere with whom we have a better relationship than we did before.”



“No one trusts us, no one listens to us, no one respects us and no one fears us,” he complained.



And when it comes to the Russian leader whose provocative actions in Ukraine have flummoxed the White House foreign policy team, Huckabee quipped, “The only time Vladimir Putin shivers is when he has his shirt off in a cold Russian winter.”



Huckabee added that Israel, a country he called America’s “one true ally,” has been “incredibly mistreated” by the Obama administration.



“It is the duty and responsibility of the American government to make us safer and more secure not less,” he said.



Huckabee, who said in December that he was not closing the door on a 2016 presidential run, fit in a mild jab at former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who under intense questioning from members of Congress about the terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya once told lawmakers: “What difference at this point does it make?”



“With all due respect to Hillary Clinton,” Huckabee said in his speech to the conservative gathering, “it does make a difference.”



The former pastor, who competed for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, threaded his speech with biblical references -- even though, he noted, talking about God in America is not always “politically correct.”



“A nation that can remember him will be a nation that will be remembered by him,” he said."

""Thank God. That's all I've gotta say,"" Morgan told a TV critics' meeting Thursday, where he was promoting his new TBS comedy ""The Last O.G.""

In 2014, the former ""30 Rock"" and ""Saturday Night Live"" star suffered severe head trauma when a truck slammed into the back of the limo van he was riding in. Comedian James McNair, his friend and collaborator, was killed.

Morgan said his brush with death had a profound effect on him. That includes the kind of sitcom he's doing. In ""The Last O.G.,"" Morgan plays an ex-con, Tray, who finds the life and the Brooklyn, New York, neighborhood he left behind is gone.

Morgan has surrounded himself with a strong cast, including ""Girls Trip"" breakout star Tiffany Haddish and Cedric the Entertainer. Why didn't he just go with a ""Tracy Morgan Show"" that gave him all the laughs?

""Maybe I'm just a better man since the accident. Maybe I'm just a better man,"" he said. ""It ain't about me. It's bigger than me.""

He indicated the physical effects of the crash may not be entirely in the past, saying people around him on set makes sure he takes regular breaks during the workday.

""The Last O.G."" co-stars Haddish as Tray's ex-girlfriend, Shay, the mother of twins he didn't know he had. In the 15 years he was imprisoned, Shay moved on, marrying a successful man (Ryan Gaul) who is helping raise the children.

Gaul's character is white, and Morgan said the sitcom is deliberately inclusive.

New York is home to more than black people, and all lives matter, he said."

ABC's ARLETTE SAENZ : In a stunning blow to Democrats, ABC News can project Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. , will win the Arkansas Senate race Tuesday night, based on preliminary exit poll results. Cotton is projected to unseat two-term Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor, the first Senate Democrat to lose their seat this election cycle. This is the second seat Republicans have picked-up Tuesday night.





Pryor’s loss is a major upset to Democrats who were hoping to hold onto the seat and keep Republicans from taking control of the Senate. Pryor comes from a popular political family in the state. His father, David Pryor, represented Arkansas in the U. S. Senate and served as the state’s governor. The family maintains close ties with the Clintons, a connection that prompted former President Bill Clinton to campaign on Pryor’s behalf on multiple occasions.





But Cotton, a one term congressman and former Army Ranger who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, was able to break through Pryor’s deep political connections in the state. Throughout the campaign, Cotton, 37, repeatedly tied Pryor to President Obama, whose favorability has reached an all-time low, and stressed issues related to national security, including how the administration’s is dealing with ISIS, on the campaign trail.

In many respects, he was a typical teenager. He studied, rising to the 10th grade at the local high school. He worked, helping his grandmother run the small business that supported his family. And he looked after his younger sister, Reyna, who relied on him after their parents separated.



“He was kind of my dad,” Reyna said, “because since I was little he always helped me with homework, teach me sports, and everything he could.”



Tijuana, however, where Velazquez lived, is not a typical place. For decades, the city has been an important staging ground for the multi-billion-dollar business of moving illegal drugs from South and Central America into the United States. It is home to warring cartels who conduct business in bloodshed: there were 910 homicides in Tijuana in 2016, and with 785 homicides documented so far this year, 2017 is on pace to be one of the most violent years in recent memory.



“[Tijuana is] very important,” said Steve Gomez, a former FBI agent and ABC News consultant, who spent years working against the cartels. “[It’s] probably the most important city … for all of the cartels in Mexico.”



At the start of his presidential campaign, Donald Trump accused Mexico of exporting drugs and the crime that follows in their wake. He has since pledged to “build a wall” between the United States and Mexico and announced plans to deputize thousands of new U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers to police it.



“We have some bad hombres here,” said Trump of those who have been allowed to pass through the country’s southern border, “and we’re going to get them out.”



On the night of Nov. 18, 2013, Velazquez arrived the San Ysidro Port of Entry, the Western Hemisphere’s busiest land-border crossing. Government surveillance video obtained by ABC News of his encounter with border officers shows in gripping detail just how far officers would go as they questioned a young man caught between the powerful forces on opposite sides of the cross-border drug trade.



That footage -- which aired for the first time Friday on Good Morning America, World News Tonight with David Muir, 20/20 and Nightline -- sparked a year-long ABC News investigation of U.S. Customs and Border Protection with



“There is a clear history of agents and officers engaging in what I believe was serious misconduct, documented by my office, in many instances who received little or no discipline whatsoever as a result,” said James Tomsheck, the former head of internal affairs for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, who has become a sharp critic of the agency after being ousted amid controversy.



In response to the investigation,



But for Velazquez, and for other young people, the consequences of that alleged misconduct were extreme, suggesting that at least some of the “bad hombres” are not the people crossing the border, but the people patrolling it. Cruz Velazquez was only 16 when a stranger handed down his death sentence.In many respects, he was a typical teenager. He studied, rising to the 10th grade at the local high school.

Velazquez was playing with Reyna at his grandmother’s house when he abruptly announced that he was going to the gym.



“Why?” Reyna protested. “It’s too late.”



There was a movie on television that she was eager to watch with him.



“No te preocupes,” he said. “Don’t worry. I’m gonna be back.”



He shouldered his bag and left -- not for the gym, but for the border.



Velazquez was carrying two plastic bottles filled with liquid methamphetamine destined for the United States, where the highly-concentrated mixture could be boiled down to solid form and sold.



A dedicated student with dreams of higher education, Velazquez might have seemed an unlikely smuggler. Reyna said the signs were subtle, starting perhaps with a new group of friends.



According to former FBI agent Gomez, the cartels frequently enlist young drug mules from the city who are willing to embrace risky work for “a quick buck.” Its members can also manufacture motivation where it is lacking. The cartels gather information about the families of promising recruits, Gomez said, so that reluctant couriers might be reminded that their families’ safety depends on their success.



“That is part of the noose that they put around their neck,” Gomez said.



Velazquez was one of about 75,000 people to attempt to enter the United States through San Ysidro that day, and he would have expected an easier trip than most. He had a border crossing card allowing him to skip the long lines and enter the country through the so-called “Ready Lane.”



When he presented his credentials to the officer at the primary inspection area, however, he immediately ran into trouble. The officer was suspicious of Velazquez, so he sent him to a secondary checkpoint, a post manned by a pair of relatively new officers named Valerie Baird and Adrian Perallon, for further scrutiny.



They asked Velazquez to place his bag on the counter, and they removed the two bottles inside. Baird examined the bottles first, turning them over in her hands, and then passed them to Perallon. The officers would later say Velazquez claimed to be carrying only “juice,” but one bottle was labelled black tea, the other apple juice, and both of them appeared to contain the same viscous, yellow liquid.



At this point, Velazquez, and perhaps his family, were in danger. According to Gomez, the cartel would have had someone waiting on the other side of the border to confirm that he had crossed safely. If he was detained, his absence would have been reported immediately, potentially triggering a visit to his family back in Mexico.



“In his mind, the cartel is worse that the U.S. agents,” said Gomez. “A lot of times, they don’t even wanna hear the excuse. They’ll just kill everybody and make an example.”



There are conflicting accounts of exactly what happened next, but video of the encounter shows that Baird and Perallon did not use a nearby kit to test the contents of the bottles.



Instead, they appear to suggest, or at least permit, Velasquez to prove that the liquid was indeed juice. Baird pushed a bottle toward Velazquez and raised her right hand, suggesting he was led down a dangerous path with a familiar gesture.



Drink it.

Velazquez barely hesitated. He took a drink. Perallon, who maintains he always thought it was just juice, appears to tell him to take another sip. Velazquez complied.



While it is unclear whether Velazquez knew exactly what he was carrying, the officers had reason to be suspicious. In March, the agency issued a press release after a Juarez woman was caught attempting to smuggle 26 pounds of liquid methamphetamine through the border in bottles in El Paso.



Two minutes later, the officers appear to encourage Velazquez to drink more. He took two more swigs.



Baird and Perallon exchanged smiles.



In total, Velazquez swallowed four sips of a solution tests would later reveal to be more than a hundred times stronger than the typical dose of methamphetamine. According to Dr. Ben Nordstrom, chief clinical officer of the drug addiction treatment center Phoenix House, those drinks constituted a “truly massive overdose,” the biggest he had ever seen, but the effects would have been delayed as the drug was absorbed into his bloodstream.



“He’s not gonna be able to feel it,” Nordstrom said. “But his blood pressure is going to be creeping up all along. He’s gonna start to feel restless.”



The inspection continued as Velazquez’s temperature began to rise. It was a cool day, so Velazquez had pulled a white “Hollister” hoodie over his t-shirt and blue jeans, but suddenly he began to sweat. He wiped his brow. He pulled off his sweatshirt.



But the officers did not call for medical attention. Instead, they took him into custody. After an alert from a drug-sniffing dog, they put Velazquez in handcuffs and led him into a security office, where the effects of his overdose would become obvious. Not only was he sweating profusely, but he was shaking and struggling to breathe.



“I remember putting my hand on him and just told him to, like, relax, calm down,” Baird said later. “I thought he was nervous that he was going to get caught.”



Velazquez grew increasingly frantic and fearful as his temperature spiked and his heart raced.



“When I was standing with him, he was telling me to hit him. He wanted me to hit him,” Perallon added. “And then he just said that he didn't want to die.”



He began to scream, prompting Nina Signorello, another officer who was stationed nearby, to come to his aid. Perallon was a fluent Spanish speaker, and Signorello knew enough of the language to pick up a few final fragments: “son quimicos” and “mi corazon” and “mi hermana.”



They were chemicals. My heart. My sister.



By the time paramedics arrived, Velazquez could no longer stand on his own. Officers loaded him onto a gurney. He was delirious, they said later. His eyes were rolling. He was thrashing so violently that they handcuffed him to the guardrails.



At one point, his temperature reached 105 degrees and his heart was beating 220 times per minute.



Velazquez lost consciousness in the ambulance on the way to the Sharp Medical Center in nearby Chula Vista, where doctors tried and failed to resuscitate him. Velazquez was pronounced dead, at age 16, less than a half hour after his arrival.



The autopsy report would rule his cause of death to be acute methamphetamine intoxication. The medical examiner determined “the manner of death is accident.”





Through the Freedom of Information Act, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) obtained the files of 149 cases from 2011 to 2015 in which unaccompanied minors reported threats of or actual physical abuse, including sexual abuse, by border officers.



“It's really very shocking,” said Mitra Ebadolahi, a lawyer with the ACLU’s border project in San Diego. “It's a story of egregious abuse of children who are vulnerable.”



In 2010, a San Diego high school student named Jahveel Ocampo, then 15, was detained by border officers because of an expired visa. She claims that a male officer threatened to rape her unless she agreed to voluntarily deport herself.



“I was scared,” Ocampo said. “He said that they could take me into the backroom and they can rape me and no one was going to do anything about it. Nobody could hear me. Nobody was going to come and save me.”



According to internal documents, this complaint, and almost every complaint the ACLU reviewed, was closed after the officers “provided accounts that she was not mistreated, verbally abused, or intimidated,” even though the young woman was never interviewed during the investigation.



In one of the most serious alleged cases, two sisters who asked that their names be withheld fled violence in Guatemala in the summer of 2016 only to be violated, they say, by a U.S. border officer.



“He told me to take off my bra and he started touching me,” one said. “Then he told me to take off my pants and he touched my privates.”



“The agent came back with my sister and then said to me, ‘It‘s your turn,’” said the other, “Pull down your underwear. He reached his hand out and put his hand in between my legs. And the worst was when he told me, ‘Turn around.’ ‘Bend over.’ And I bent over.”



Their complaint, like many others, the ACLU says, was closed, when the officer denied he did anything wrong. The agency initially told the ACLU the case was closed but



According to the ACLU, none of the case files they reviewed indicate that an officer was reprimanded, suspended or terminated as a result of any complaint.



“As far as I can tell,” Ebadolahi said, “there hasn’t been a single complete investigation on any of the allegations I have seen.”



Efforts to reform the agency appear to have met with resistance. Tomsheck, a longtime U.S. Secret Service officer who served as the head of internal affairs for U.S. Customs and Border Protection for eight years, says the lack of robust internal investigations has allowed rogue border officers to operate with impunity – sometimes with deadly consequences.



“Within that large organization are many who believe they’re held to a different standard and won’t be held accountable for engaging in misconduct,” Tomsheck said.



Early in his tenure, Tomsheck raised concerns about the process of hiring new border officers. The rapid expansion of U.S. Customs and Border Protection had not only made it the largest law enforcement agency in the country but also put stress on his office’s means of screening applicants and investigating misconduct.



“While the integrity threat has increased,” he wrote to his superiors in 2008, “we have decreased one of our best means of detecting corruption in our workforce.”



Tomsheck believes that pressure to grow resulted in the hiring of scores of unqualified or unsuitable candidates. His concerns about those new officers, he says, seemed to “fall on deaf ears.” At the same time, he said, some officers reinforced the notion that border officers are on the front lines of a conflict in which extreme measures are not only justified, but encouraged.



“They see themselves deployed in a military tactical operation,” Tomsheck said, “not in a law enforcement security operation.” Critics say the Velazquez case is another example of misconduct by officers of a troubled agency.Through the Freedom of Information Act, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) obtained the files of 149 cases from 2011 to 2015 in which unaccompanied minors reported threats of or actual physical abuse, including sexual abuse, by border officers.“It's really very shocking,” said Mitra Ebadolahi, a lawyer with the ACLU’s border project in San Diego. “It's a story of egregious abuse of children who are vulnerable.”In 2010, a San Diego high school student named Jahveel Ocampo, then 15, was detained by border officers because of an expired visa.

In recent years, there have been several cases since in which agents’ use of deadly force has been called into question -- but not criminally prosecuted.



In one case, another Mexican teenager, 15, was shot and killed by a border agent in 2010, supposedly for throwing rocks from the Mexican side of the border. The agent was not prosecuted.



In another infamous case from 2012, a border agent patrolling the Rio Grande in an air boat shot at a family on a picnic on the Mexican side of the river, killing the father before speeding away. Even though the episode and its aftermath was caught on video, no criminal charges were filed. Agents later claimed someone in the group was also throwing rocks.



Gil Kerlikowske, who served as commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection in the Obama administration from 2014 to 2017, acknowledged that the rapid growth of the agency might have resulted in the hiring of unqualified officers, but he disputed Tomsheck’s characterization of the agency and its officers and defended his handling of disciplinary matters.



“The number of complaints that come in are high,” Kerlikowske said. “I’d say under my watch, we’ve increased dramatically our ability to do these investigations.”



If there was corruption at the agency, Kerlikowske said, it is Tomsheck who should be held accountable for it.



“The buck stopped with him for eight years,” Kerlikowske said. “If you can’t do the job in eight years, you really need to look in the mirror.”



But Tomsheck says that rather than address problems with excessive use of force, the agency’s administration attempted to silence criticism out of fear that it could ruin reputations and damage careers.



In 2010, Tomsheck says he was ordered to falsify reports about the death of Anastasio Hernandez Rojas, a Mexican man who died after being repeatedly tasered by border agents at the same San Ysidro border crossing station where Velazquez was stopped. Tomsheck says his superiors insisted that he make it appear as if the man was “standing and combative” when he was beaten, even though the facts suggested otherwise.



“The truth [was he] was restrained,” Tomsheck said. “Handcuffed behind his back, face down on the ground.”



Tomsheck refused to cooperate. It was an attempted cover-up, Tomsheck says, and it wouldn’t be the last time he would clash with his superiors over inconvenient facts.



In a 2014 email, Tomsheck raised concerns to Kerlikowske about several “disturbing cases” of sexual abuse “that appear to exist in disproportionate numbers in our workforce.”



The commissioner never responded, Tomsheck says, but shortly after he sent the email he was criticized by a superior officer for putting his concerns in writing and then given the choice to resign, retire or accept reassignment to a position where, he says, he couldn’t cause any more trouble. He chose to retire, he says, his career another casualty of corruption.



“I think they wanted to silence me,” Tomsheck said, “to put me in a position that if I continued to speak out within the organization, I could be ordered to stop.”



Kerlikowske, however, denied the suggestion that he or the agency suppressed allegations of misconduct.



“I don’t see any cover-up,” Kerlikowske said, “especially by me.”



While he says he was disappointed that his career in law enforcement ended so abruptly, Tomsheck believed, at least, the Velazquez case would be handled properly.



“I was definitively told that the two officers involved would be punished,” Tomsheck said. “It would simply be a question of what level of discipline they received.”

The officers under oath Officer Adrian Perallon said he did not ask Cruz to take a drink from one of the bottles but that Cruz ""volunteered."" Officer Valerie Baird said that Perallon ""proposed"" that Cruz should take a drink. Perallon denies that. Officer Nina Signorello said that when she drove Baird to the hospital, Baird said, ""Oh my God, I asked him to drink it."" Baird says she ""misunderstood."" It was Reyna who picked up the late-night phone call from the Mexican consulate in San Diego.



The man on the other end of the line was trying to reach her parents, so she passed the phone to her father. He began to scream.



“Cruz is not with us anymore,” he told her. “They say he died trying to cross the border.”



Reyna refused to believe it.



“You’re lying,” she said. “He can’t be dead. I just saw him. He went to the gym.”



She travelled, with her mother, to view her brother’s body, likely crossing through the same border station where her brother had died.



“They opened the door so my mom could get in,” Reyna said. “I see [the] face of my brother. And then I realized everything was true.”



They told her, she says, that while attempting to smuggle bottles of liquid methamphetamine across the border, he had taken a drink from a bottle voluntarily.



She refused to believe that, too, but this time, she wasn’t alone.



The Velazquez family hired Gene Iredale, a San Diego-based attorney whose firm specializes in civil rights litigation, and filed a civil lawsuit against Baird, Perallon and the U.S. government, alleging that the officers “intimidated and coerced” Velazquez into drinking from one of the bottles and failed to “render timely medical assistance,” actions that “proximately caused his death.”



“What you see, I think, is a basic lack of compassion and decency toward a 16-year-old boy,” Iredale said. “Almost a delight that you would see in children who just pull the wings off flies slowly, a smile when he's being asked to drink something and being put in this position.”



The U.S. Attorney’s Office declined to bring criminal charges and the internal investigation resulted in no discipline, but during their depositions, Iredale sought to highlight the contradictions in each officer’s tale to dissect what he called “the anatomy of a lie.” Under that pressure, the officers’ efforts to shift blame for Velazquez’s death got messy. (Both officers, through their attorneys, declined to be interviewed by ABC News.)



While video of the encounter shows that both officers made hand gestures that seemed to encourage Velazquez to drink from one of the bottles, during their depositions, both officers denied under oath that they had done anything wrong.



Perallon blamed Velazquez: “I never suggested or asked him to drink,” he said. “He volunteered to drink.”



But Baird blamed Perallon: “He proposed to me that he should ask Cruz if he would be willing to take a drink,” she said. “He said he does it all the time in primary, and I said, ‘If that’s what you want to do.’” Perallon denied this interaction took place.



Nina Signorello, the officer who tried to help Velazquez while he was in the security office and later drove Baird to the hospital, provided what Iredale considers the key piece of evidence, testifying that Baird was initially worried that she would lose her job if someone ultimately blamed her.



“Oh my God, I asked him to drink it,” Baird said, according to Signorello’s testimony. Baird denied that, saying her fellow officer must have “misunderstood.”



Asked multiple times if she felt guilty that Velazquez was dead, Baird responded, repeatedly, “No.”



“Because you also realized what the cause of his death was, right?” Iredale asked.



“The cause of it? No. The specific cause?” Baird responded. “No. He was just – He just died.”



Neither Baird nor Perallon were subject to discipline as a result of their involvement in Velazquez’s death, and both officers remain on duty to this day. Kerlikowske, who took over as commissioner after the incident but would have inherited oversight of the officers involved, struggled to explain why.



“I don’t have the knowledge and the specifics about the case itself,” Kerlikowske said. He told ABC News he had never seen the video and declined an offer to watch it now.



For the Velazquez family attorney Iredale, the message is as clear as it is devastating.



“Well, it’s a very simple lesson,” Iredale said. “Do what you want. So long as the person who’s hurt doesn’t have political power … doesn’t speak English, from a foreign country, have a good time.”

Rather than rein in the agency, President Donald Trump seems poised to set them loose.



The leadership of the union representing the border patrol agents endorsed him during the campaign, and he repaid them with two new executive orders calling for tougher immigration enforcement measures, including the hiring of 5,000 new border patrol agents.



""This is a law enforcement agency,” Trump said during a speech delivered to the Department of Homeland Security shortly after taking office, “but for too long, your officers and agents haven't been allowed to properly do their jobs.”



If the message got lost, Sean Spicer, Trump’s then-press secretary, hammered it home about a month later.



“The President wanted to take the shackles off individuals in these agencies,” Spicer said.



According to Tomsheck, those words sent shockwaves throughout the agency and could ultimately lead to more aggressive practices.



“I’ve listened carefully to some agents that I still enjoy a friendship with, and have heard from them that many in the border patrol believe that their actions are going to be subjected to even less scrutiny than they were before,” Tomsheck said.



It’s possible, however, that Trump has already made his biggest impression on the U.S.-Mexico border. Words, Iredale says, like the “bad hombres” label, reinforce the notion that the lives of those who would cross the border are somehow less valuable.



“It allows stereotyping to have the imprimatur of the most powerful person in the country,” Iredale said. “It says it’s all right to feel scorn, to feel superiority, to have a slightly sarcastic sense of bigotry toward these people because, after all, they’re not like us.”



Reyna, now 16 herself, knows too well those words can have unforeseen consequences. Her brother was buried on a hill in Tijuana, where Reyna and her family visit him every month.



Earlier this year, the U.S. government paid the Velazquez family $1 million to settle their lawsuit, but there was no apology and no admission of wrongdoing, baffling those who knew Velazquez as more than a stereotype.



“How can the government allow that? It’s like, OK you can kill someone,” Reyna said. “They took him as a fool, as who cares. Well, that fool, he was the greatest person I ever knew.”"

While some Trump advisers are pushing for this, others aren't, meaning no decision has been reached and the president and his team are weighing all options.

Sessions has been under fire from the president. Trump has publicly called the attorney general ""beleaguered"" and said he wouldn't have named the former Alabama senator to head the Justice Department had he known that Sessions would recuse himself from the Russia investigation, a move that ultimately opened the door to the appointment of a special counsel to lead the probe.

The position of secretary of Homeland Security is now open with Gen. John Kelly moving from that post to become the new White House chief of staff.

Sessions, in an interview with Fox News, called the president’s public criticism of him “kind of hurtful.” When asked if he would step down from his post at the Justice Department, Sessions said he serves “at the pleasure of the president.”

“If he wants to make a change he can certainly do so,” said Sessions. “I would be glad to yield in that circumstance, no doubt about it, but I do believe that we are making tremendous progress.”

Moving Sessions to the Homeland Security role could potentially allow the president to bring in a new attorney general who could take over the investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and possible ties to Trump associates.

But the prospect of possibly removing special counsel Robert Mueller, who heads the Russia probe, has drawn strong words of caution even from some Republicans.

""Any effort to go after Mueller could be the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency,"" Republican Sen. Lindsay Graham of South Carolina said this week."

""Please don't be too nice,"" he said to the audience in Long Island, New York.

While the speech was largely focused on the fight against the gang MS-13, it appeared that Trump was directing his comments about police interactions with suspected criminals in general.

He described the precautions typically taken by police where they place a hand over a suspect's head while they're being put into a police car to protect them.

""When you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just seen them thrown in, rough. I said, ‘Please don’t be too nice,’"" he said.

""When you guys put somebody in the car and you’re protecting their head you know, the way you put their hand over [their head],"" Trump continued, mimicking the motion. ""Like, 'Don’t hit their head and they’ve just killed somebody, don’t hit their head.' I said, 'You can take the hand away, OK?'

""I have to tell you, you know, the laws are so horrendously stacked against us, because for years and years, they've been made to protect the criminal. Totally made to protect the criminal. Not the officers. You do something wrong, you're in more jeopardy than they are,"" he added.

At one point during the speech, he seemingly praised the perceived toughness of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.

""I can tell you, I saw some photos where [acting ICE Director] Tom [Homan]'s guys, rough guys, they're rough, I don't want to ... say it because they'll say that's not politically correct, you're not allowed to have rough people doing this kind of work. ... Just like they don't want to have rich people at the head of treasury,"" Trump said.

The Suffolk County Police Department, the county in which Trump spoke, tweeted about its policy on handling prisoners -- although it did not specifically cite the president.

""The SCPD has strict rules & procedures relating to the handling of prisoners,"" it tweeted following the president's speech. ""Violations of those rules are treated extremely seriously.""

A subsequent tweet read, ""As a department, we do not and will not tolerate roughing up of prisoners.""

The American Civil Liberties Union also responded, condemning the president’s remarks.

“By encouraging police to dole out extra pain at will, the president is urging a kind of lawlessness that already imperils the health and lives of people of color at shameful rates,” Jeffery Robinson, deputy legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union and director of the ACLU’s Trone Center for Justice and Equality, said in a statement.

“Innocent until proven guilty? Our president would rather not bother with that, expanding the role of the police officer to include judge, jury, and executioner,” he said.

“This country is weary of the type of policing that Trump espouses, having seen over and over again that it only makes it harder for police to investigate and solve crime,” he said.

This isn't the first time that Trump has seemingly condoned physicality.

During a campaign stop in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on the day of the Iowa caucuses, for instance, he told audience members he would pay their legal fees if they engaged in violence against protesters.

""If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously, OK? Just knock the hell ... I promise you I will pay for the legal fees. I promise, I promise,"" he said on Feb. 1, 2016.

At a Las Vegas rally later that month, he said security guards were too gentle with a protester. ""He's walking out with big high-fives, smiling, laughing,"" Trump said. ""I'd like to punch him in the face, I'll tell you.""

A similar situation unfolded at a rally that month in Warren, Michigan.

""Get him out,"" he said of a protester. ""Try not to hurt him. If you do, I'll defend you in court. Don't worry about it."""

Rose Ellis, of Tulsa, was picking up dresses to alter at the Alfred Angelo store in Oklahoma City earlier this month when she was told by the store manager she needed to call her brides because the store was closing permanently at 6 p.m.

Alfred Angelo informed customers via the website and messages on closed storefronts around July 14 that it was filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and advised them to contact the chain’s bankruptcy trustee via email. The chain, which had around 60 stores across the U.S., had been in business for nearly 80 years.

Google

Ellis, who worked with Alfred Angelo for the past seven years, gathered around 60 dresses in the Oklahoma City store that had been paid for and needed alterations and brought them home with her.

She began individually calling each customer she had contact information for, telling them their dress was in her possession and would be returned to them, with the alterations done, at no additional charge.

Rose Ellis

""They’re very excited that I have their dress and sorry that I’m going through all of this,"" said Ellis, who said she has not been paid by Alfred Angelo since June. ""It’s not fair for me to charge them again and I wouldn’t hold their dresses for ransom either, that’s crazy as well.""

Stephanie Huey, 33, of Oklahoma City, found Ellis through Facebook after posting in panic because her bridesmaids’ Alfred Angelo dresses were at the Oklahoma City store awaiting alterations.

Stephanie Huey

Huey knew only Ellis’s first name, but a friend had her business card and Ellis got in touch to let Huey know she had the dresses.

""I was shocked,"" Huey said. ""We found out while we were standing in another boutique shopping for some off-the-rack dresses that they could wear.""

She added, ""We said [to the salesclerk], ‘Thank you so much for your time, but we found our dresses.'""

When Huey found out that Ellis had dozens of paid-for dresses in her possession, she began connecting her with other brides-to-be searching for help on Facebook. She also arranged for a local hotel in Oklahoma City to donate space where Ellis could reunite Alfred Angelo customers with their wedding gowns.

""When I got to the hotel, she had only brought four or five dresses and I asked her, 'Where are the other dresses?' and she said, 'I’m not finished with those yet,'"" Huey recalled.

""I was just dumbfounded,"" she continued, ""I thought her good deed was just to bring the dresses back to everyone, but she was still doing all the alterations -- and for free.""

Brooke Ashlock, 35, of Waukomis, is holding a vow renewal next month and found Ellis through Huey’s Facebook post.

Ashlock said she was “having a heart attack” about losing the $1,200 she paid in full for her dress and alterations. Now, she plans to pick up her altered dress from Ellis today.

Brooke Ashlock

""There was no way I could have bought another dress,"" Ashlock said. ""And when I spoke to [Ellis] she didn’t even mention money. For her to not be asking the brides to pay extra, that is amazing to me.""

Other brides-to-be who lost their gowns in the Alfred Angelo closing have been helped by strangers who are using hashtags like #dressmatchmaker and #AlfredAngelo online to donate their dresses.

The women who were helped by Ellis have started a GoFundMe account to help defray her travel expenses and the cost of doing the alterations for free.

""I really understand that when you own a business, every drop of your sweat has a price on it,"" said Huey, who created the GoFundMe for Ellis. ""This woman is just doing so much out of the goodness of her heart.""

Ellis said she has not heard from nor been able to reach anyone at Alfred Angelo. Patricia Redmond, a lawyer for the company, did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment about Ellis.

Her current focus, Ellis said, is on delivering each of the gowns to their rightful owners.

""My agenda is to make sure that all my brides I have come in contact with have that fabulous wedding day that they were expecting to have from the beginning,"" said Ellis, who called herself ""very grateful"" for the outpouring of support.

After she finishes with these dresses, then she will worry about her future.

""All I can do is wait and see,"" Ellis said. ""But I can just say, 'Hey, if my girls are taken care of and they can walk down the aisle with a smile, there’s no worries.'"""

Priebus said he would continue to support Trump, adding that he would ""continue to serve as a strong supporter of the President's agenda and policies.""

""I can't think of a better person than General John Kelly to succeed me and I wish him God's blessings and great success,"" said Priebus.

Kelly wrote in a statement, ""I have been fortunate to have served my country for more than 45 years - first as a Marine and then as the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. I am honored to be asked to serve as the Chief of Staff to the President of the United States.""

On Thursday, Ryan had urged Priebus and new White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci to “sit down and settle” their differences, amongst speculation of disagreement in the White House.

Newt Gingrich also took to Twitter to praise both Priebus and Kelly. “Priebus will go down in history as one of the most important RNC chairs in the 163 year history of the GOP. He changed history,” Gingrich said.

http://abcnews.go.com/International/charlie-gard-baby-center-end-life-debate-died/story?id=48911250,go,"Charlie Gard, baby at center of end-of-life debate, has died","['Abc News', 'Dragana Jovanovic', 'Mike Trew', 'More Morgan']","Terminally ill British infant Charlie Gard, whose parents’ fight for his life drew worldwide attention, has died, according to a family spokesperson.

Alison Smith-Squire, a spokeswoman for Charlie's family, said in a statement to ABC News: ""The boy who touched the world has passed away today. [Charlie's mother] Connie [Yates] said: 'Our beautiful little boy has gone, we're so proud of him.'""

After a long and emotional legal battle, Britain's High Court decided Thursday that Charlie should be moved from a hospital to a hospice, where the 11-month-old would be taken off life support and ""inevitably"" die.

Judge Nicholas Francis issued the order after Charlie's parents and the hospital treating him failed to meet a deadline set by the court to agree on an end-of-life plan that could have kept the incurably ill baby alive for a few more days. The judge ruled that Charlie, whose rare illness damaged his brain and rendered him unable to breathe on his own, would then be transferred to a hospice by the hospital medical team and have his ventilator removed.

The exact timeline of these events and the location of the hospice were kept private by court order.

Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, which was treating Charlie, expressed its grief to the family in a statement released Friday after his death.

""Everyone at Great Ormond Street Hospital sends their heartfelt condolences to Charlie’s parents and loved-ones at this very sad time,” the hospital said.

Pope Francis offered his condolences to Charlie's family and ""all those who loved him"" on Twitter.

I entrust little Charlie to the Father and pray for his parents and all those who loved him. — Pope Francis (@Pontifex) July 28, 2017

Vice President Mike Pence tweeted, ""Saddened to hear of the passing of Charlie Gard. Karen & I offer our prayers & condolences to his loving parents during this difficult time.""

Saddened to hear of the passing of Charlie Gard. Karen & I offer our prayers & condolences to his loving parents during this difficult time. — Vice President Pence (@VP) July 28, 2017

On Thursday, the hospital released a statement saying the case has been ""a uniquely painful and distressing process for all concerned,"" and that it regrets it ""had to be played out in court over such a protracted period.""

""As the judge has now ruled, we will arrange for Charlie to be transferred to a specialist children's hospice, whose remarkable and compassionate staff will support his family at this impossible time,"" the hospital said Thursday. ""Every single one of us wishes there could have been a less tragic outcome.""

In court Wednesday, both Charlie's parents and his physicians at Great Ormond Street Hospital agreed that the child should spend his last days in a hospice rather than die at home or in the hospital. But they disagreed over the details on how Charlie would spend the last hours of his life.

Charlie’s family had hoped to assemble a medical team who could move him from Great Ormond Street Hospital to a hospice and supervise the intensive care the infant required so they could spend several days with their son before taking him off life support. But the doctor who had contacted the family offering to help lacked the proper qualifications. The unnamed doctor was a general practitioner with no intensive care experience and no medical team.

The judge then gave Charlie's parents until Thursday to reach an agreement with the hospital if they could not provide a qualified doctor and team.

Yates, Charlie's mother, delivered an emotional statement in court Monday, announcing the reasons behind her and dad Chris Gard's decision to stop pushing to take their son to the United States for potential experimental treatments to prolong his life. Gard read a similar message outside court.

“This is one of the hardest things we’ve ever had to say and we are about to do one of the hardest things we’ve ever had to do,” he told reporters Monday, reading from a sheet of paper.

Gard said that it was no longer in his son's best interest to seek treatment, and that they had decided to let him go and ""be with the angels.""

""Our son is an absolute warrior,"" Gard said of his baby. ""We will miss him terribly.""

An assessment in the United Kingdom from an American doctor who specializes in mitochondrial depletion syndrome, the rare disease from which Charlie suffered, said the baby's condition would not have been improved by the treatments."

http://liveblog.abcnews.go.com/Event/Republican_National_Convention_Live_Updates_and_Analysis,go,Republican National Convention: Live Updates and Analysis,['Abc News'],"ANALYSIS: Trump Takes Role as Angry Savior for Nation’s ‘Disaster’

ABC's RICK KLEIN: He’s been an entrepreneur and an entertainer, a provocateur and, most recently, a politician.

Now comes Donald J. Trump, angry savior. In wrapping up a convention that was unmistakably his, delivering an extra-long speech very much in his own staccato, Trump combined elements of all of his former careers to try the role of a lifetime -- ready to fix a country he believes to be deeply broken, and that he believes he is uniquely suited to mend.

“Nobody knows the system better than me -- which is why I alone can fix it,” Trump said in his acceptance speech.

Trump, with the help of his daughter on Thursday, may or may not have saved his own convention, after the campaign’s self-imposed distractions and a hostile takeover attempt by a scorned rival. That media-ready candy replaced the meager policy vegetables offered up by speakers earlier in the week -– sideshows that were novel yet somehow predictable at Trump convention.

But whether Trump succeeds more broadly in the election will depend on grim calculations: that voters see the country as broken and beaten, and that they will reject Trump’s rival as corrupt, criminal, or worse.

Those twin themes are apparent in the way Trump has rewritten a Hillary Clinton campaign slogan -– “I’m with her” -– for his own purposes.

“My pledge reads: ‘I’m with you – the American people,’” Trump said.

Trump’s speech was a gloomy exclamation point on a run-on sentence of a convention. After the first three days meandered through major themes, Trump on Thursday marched through a parade of horribles: poverty, crime, terrorism, illegal immigration, trade, unemployment, war and Hillary Clinton.

“This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness,” he said.

Trump’s answer includes, prominently, a promise of “law and order.” At one point, when the crowd starting chanting, “Lock her up,” Trump responded with what counts as restraint for him: “Let's defeat her in November.""

Trump used his family to offer the uplift that his speech, and much of his convention, lacked.

offered powerful personal testimony to her father, humanizing him while connecting biography to policy –- just not the policies that Trump is best known for endorsing.

“He will fight for equal pay for equal work and I will fight for this too, right alongside of him,” she said. “Politicians ask to be judged by their promises, not their results. I ask you to judge my father by his results.”

Like her father, Ivanka Trump underscored qualifications she views as making him unique.

“In ways no one expected, this moment in the life of our country has defined a mission, and given it to an extraordinary man,” she said.

Her dad wouldn’t disagree. Eight years ago, the next president was ushered into office on the strength of “yes we can.” After a year of campaigning and winning, Trump is replacing that with the first person singular.

“People who work hard but no longer have a voice –- I am your voice,” he said.

Trump is making a calculation, but it’s not a blind one. Trump’s voice has gotten louder because of what he senses in the country he’s traveled.

Inside the broad of statements Trump made -- “Safety will be restored,” “Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo,” “I am the law and order candidate” -- is a deep sense of anxiety that Trump is recognizing and amplifying during his remarkable campaign for the White House.

“America is back,” Trump thundered, well more than an hour into his speech. “History is watching us now. We don’t have much time, but history is watching.”

The balloons fell, the Trumps were joined by the Pences, and the campaign music blared the Rolling Stones: “You Can’t Always Get What You Want.” http://abcn.ws/2azBaSA"

Jack Nicklaus contended with Arnold Palmer on the front end of his career and Tom Watson on the back end.

Usain Bolt? Nobody has been a match for him, on or off the track.

The man who reshaped the record book and saved his sport is saying goodbye. His sprints through the 100 meters and Jamaica's 4x100 relay at the world championships, which begin Friday, are expected to produce golds yet again, and leave track with this difficult question: Who can possibly take his place?

""You would have to have someone who's dominating, and no one's doing that,"" said Michael Johnson, the former world-record holder at 200 and 400 meters and perhaps the sport's brightest star in the 1990s. ""You'd have to have someone who has that something special like he has, in terms of personality and presence. You're not going to have that.""

The Associated Press

Though he will not retire undefeated, Bolt stands in the rarest of company: an athlete who was never beaten when the stakes were greatest. And with a showman's flair as transcendent as his raw speed — Chicken McNuggets for dinner, his fabled ""To The World"" pose for dessert and dancing away at nightclubs till dawn — he hoisted his entire, troubled sport upon his shoulders and made it watchable and relevant.

Since his era of dominance began in 2008, Bolt went undefeated at the Olympics — 9 for 9 — in the 100, 200 and 4x100 relay. (One of those medals was stripped because of doping by a teammate on the 2008 relay team.) He has set, and re-set, the world records in all three events. His marks of 19.30, then 19.19, at 200 meters, were once thought virtually impossible. He set a goal of breaking 19 seconds in Rio de Janeiro last summer, and when he came up short, it became clear the barrier will be safe for years.

At the world championships, Bolt's only ""loss"" came in 2011, when he was disqualified for a false start in the 100 meters. Jamaican teammate Yohan Blake won the title that year, as well as the Jamaican national championships at 100 and 200 meters leading to the London Olympics. Heading back to London five years later, Blake is an afterthought.

And Bolt's mastery of this sport remains unchallenged.

""I'll be sad to see someone like him go,"" said America's Justin Gatlin, Bolt's longest and sturdiest challenger, who has been disingenuously portrayed as the brooding bad boy set against Bolt's carefree party guy. ""He's such a big figure in our sport. Not only is he a big figure, but the kind of guy who always will be a competitor when he steps onto the line.""

Though it's tricky to compare dominance in track to that in any other sport, there's an element of Nicklaus in Bolt's dominance. Impressive as his 18 major championships are, Nicklaus' 19 second-place finishes and 73 top-10s spoke to his ability to get into the mix in most of the majors over the quarter-century while he was collecting titles. Nicklaus had to fend off Palmer, Watson, Johnny Miller and a dozen other legitimate contenders at every event. Bolt hasn't faced anything like that.

The Associated Press

Yet they shared this important similarity: Often, the contests were over before they even began. Or, as Tom Weiskopf once said: ""Jack knew he was going to beat you. You knew Jack was going to beat you. And Jack knew that you knew that he was going to beat you.""

At the worlds two years ago, Gatlin had Bolt beaten in the 100 but leaned in at the finish line a microsecond too early. Bolt passed him and won by 0.01 seconds. The American all but admitted he psyched himself out.

Speaking to the pressure of racing someone such as Bolt, the Scottish sports historian and former Olympic coach Tom McNab compared sprinting to running in a tunnel.

""And once you become aware of what's happening outside your tunnel, you're in trouble,"" he said.

In boxing, Ali wasn't necessarily unbeatable, but he was incomparable as both a sharp-witted showman and an athlete with a social conscience, using his platform to preach tolerance and oppose war.

Bolt hasn't sought that sort of impact, at least not yet, but it's hard to overstate the mark he made on his troubled sport and, thus, the Olympics, which have long featured athletics as the must-see event of the final two weeks.

Over years and decades, the showcase sport of the Olympics has devolved into a sordid litany of doping scandals. The latest concerns widespread corruption and cheating in Russia, and heading into Rio, it undermined not only the sport and its managers, but the Olympics and their leaders' willingness to deal with it.

But when Bolt sauntered onto the track, flashed a peace sign and blew a kiss to the crowd, all was forgotten. Not just for the 9, or 19, seconds while he was running, but for the entire evening and beyond. He made track, and thus, the Olympics, eminently watchable.

He'll do it one more time on a smaller stage — track's world championships — but a stage with plenty of symbolic meaning.

When he headed to London for the Olympics in 2012, Bolt held all the records, but was portrayed as vulnerable, following the false start, a long list of nagging injuries and his losses to Blake.

By the time he left, he had pretty much anointed himself as the greatest. Four years later, he said that was precisely his goal: ""To be among Ali and Pele,"" he said.

He's on that list, but when the lights go out after the relays Aug. 11 — 10 days before his 31st birthday — it will be time to say goodbye.

""Once he's gone,"" McNab says, ""there's no major personality that would make any significant impact at the world level.""

“I sometimes use colorful language. I will refrain in this arena but not give up the passionate fight for @realDonaldTrump's agenda. #MAGA,” Scaramucci said in a tweet this evening after the article posted.

I sometimes use colorful language. I will refrain in this arena but not give up the passionate fight for @realDonaldTrump's agenda. #MAGA — Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) July 27, 2017

He later added, appearing to blame Lizza for publishing the exchange, ""I made a mistake in trusting in a reporter. It won't happen again.""

I made a mistake in trusting in a reporter. It won't happen again. — Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) July 28, 2017

Scaramucci was responding to an article posted on The New Yorker’s website (warning: this article contains offensive language), in which Lizza detailed the call that Lizza says the two had about Scaramucci’s hunt for leakers within the administration and his frustration with certain key members of the Trump administration, including Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Chief Strategist Steve Bannon.

At one point, Scaramucci called Priebus a “f------ paranoid schizophrenic.”

At another, Scaramucci used a vulgar phrase describing how he alleges Priebus prevented him from becoming a part of the administration in the first six months.

Lizza told CNN this evening that he spoke with Scaramucci again today and cleared it with him that his comments Wednesday night were in fact on the record.

T.J Kirkpatrick for The Wall Street Journal

The article states that the reported Wednesday evening call came after Lizza had tweeted that a senior White House official had told him about a group dinner that had occurred at the White House that night. Lizza reported that President Donald Trump, first lady Melania Trump, former Fox News executive Bill Shine and Fox News host Sean Hannity were at the dinner.

Scaramucci wanted to know who gave that information to Lizza, and threatened to fire people as a result, according to the article. Lizza would not reveal his source.

""They’ll all be fired by me. I fired one guy the other day. I have three to four people I’ll fire tomorrow. I’ll get to the person who leaked that to you. Reince Priebus -- if you want to leak something -- he’ll be asked to resign very shortly,"" Scaramucci said, the article states.

Speaking to Fox News Thursday evening, incoming White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said that Scaramucci is a ""guy who sometimes uses colorful and in many circles probably not appropriate language.""

“He's very passionate about the president and the president's agenda, and I think he may let that get the best of him in that conversation,” she added.

The conversation with Lizza comes in stark contrast to Scaramucci's first public comments in his new role. At his first White House press briefing on July 21, he praised both Priebus and Bannon.

He called Priebus ""a dear friend"" and noted that they've ""spent many times together socially.""

""Reince and I have been personal friends for six years. We are a little bit like brothers where we rough each other up once in a while, which is totally normal for brothers,"" Scaramucci said.

As for Bannon, he said, ""I think he’s one of the smartest people that I know,"" and added that he has ""a huge, enormous amount of respect for him.""

""I want to work with Stephen Bannon as closely as I possibly can,"" Scaramucci said at the briefing."
http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video-shows-border-officers-appeared-encourage-permit-teen/story?id=48903893,go,Border officers appeared to encourage teen to drink from bottle containing liquid meth,"['Abc News', 'Brian Epstein', 'Cho Park', 'More Brian', 'More Cho']","A government surveillance video obtained by ABC News has shed new light on a tragic incident at the U.S.-Mexico border, sparking outrage from members of Congress who help oversee U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

The video shows that in 2013 two U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers appeared to encourage, or at least permit, a 16-year-old Mexican high school student to drink from a bottle that tests would later reveal contained concentrated liquid methamphetamine.

The young man, Cruz Velazquez, died within two hours of drinking the substance, but the two officers involved, Valerie Baird and Adrian Perallon, remain on the job today, with no disciplinary action taken against them.

A former head of internal affairs at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, James Tomsheck, told ABC News the two officers violated agency protocols by allowing the young man to drink from the bottle, and that he was told at the time they would be punished.

“If they truly suspected there was a controlled substance in the bottle,” Tomsheck said, “they should've conducted a field test.”

Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat from California and the ranking member on the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security, condemned the officers’ conduct.

“Drug smuggling is wrong and is a crime, but this teenage boy did not deserve a death sentence,” Lofgren told ABC News. “For CBP officers to inflict a summary death sentence is not only immoral, but also illegal.”

Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Missouri and the ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, echoed those sentiments.

“In order for CBP officers to prevent smuggling, ensure public safety, and do their difficult job at the border properly, CBP must have the appropriate protocols in place and officers must follow them,” Thompson told ABC News. “While there is no excuse for attempting to bring illicit substances into the country, it is absolutely clear from the video that there were numerous failures in judgement and procedure that led to the senseless death of a 16-year-old boy. CBP must ensure that such a tragedy never occurs again.”

Rep. Adriano Espaillat, a Democrat from New York, said this incident highlights the need to pass legislation he introduced earlier this year that would require border officers to wear body cameras while on duty.

""Undocumented immigrants and green card holders are terrified,” Espaillat said in a statement, “and it is critical that we hold officers accountable and ensure that the civil rights of these individuals are not violated.”

The video, which aired for the first time Friday on Good Morning America, World News Tonight with David Muir, 20/20 and Nightline as part of a year-long investigation of U.S. Customs and Border Protection conducted by ABC News and The Investigative Fund, shows that Velazquez took four drinks from the bottle, and the officers appear to repeatedly encourage him with hand gestures.

The Velazquez family ultimately filed a civil lawsuit against the officers and the agency, claiming that the officers’ actions led to Cruz’s death.

“What you see, I think, is a basic lack of compassion and decency toward a 16-year-old boy,” said Gene Iredale, the San Diego-based attorney who represented the Velazquez family. “Almost a delight that you would see in children who just pull the wings off flies slowly, a smile when he's being asked to drink something and being put in this position.”

Both officers, who declined through their attorneys to be interviewed by ABC News, denied asking Velazquez to drink from the bottle, and the official report called the incident an “accident.” Officer Perallon claimed Velazquez “volunteered” to take a drink.

In response to the broader ABC News investigation, which revealed a history of cases in which the agency appeared to ignore accusations of mistreatment and abuse, the agency issued a statement, saying, “CBP takes all allegations of mistreatment seriously, and does not tolerate actions that are not consistent with our core values of vigilance, service to country and integrity.”

The Consulate General of Mexico in San Diego released a brief statement to ABC News.

""The Consulate General of Mexico in San Diego provided consular and legal assistance to Mr. Cruz Velazquez’s family since it learned about his death. This tragic incident highlights the need of greater transparency and accountability in immigration control activities.""

Earlier this year, the U.S. government paid the teen’s family $1 million to settle a lawsuit. There was no apology or admission of wrongdoing, and both officers testified that they never received a reprimand for their conduct, a fact that still angers members of Velazquez’s family.

“How can the government allow that? It’s like, OK you can kill someone,” Reyna Velazquez, Cruz’s sister, told ABC News. “They took him as a fool, as who cares. Well, that fool, he was the greatest person I ever knew.”

http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/federal-judge-blocks-arkansas-enforcing-abortion-laws-48923211,go,Judge blocks Arkansas from enforcing 4 abortion restrictions,['Abc News'],"A federal judge has blocked Arkansas from enforcing four new abortion restrictions, including a ban on a common second trimester procedure and a fetal remains law that opponents say would effectively require a partner's consent before a woman could get an abortion.

U.S. District Court Judge Kristine Baker issued a preliminary injunction late Friday night against the new restrictions, three of which were set to take effect Tuesday. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Reproductive Rights had challenged the measures, suing on behalf of Dr. Frederick Hopkins, a Little Rock abortion provider.

The laws include a ban on a procedure known as dilation and evacuation. Abortion rights supporters say it is the safest and most common procedure used in second-trimester abortions, but the state calls it barbaric and ""dismemberment abortion,"" saying it can have emotional consequences for the women who undergo it. Similar bans are in effect in Mississippi and West Virginia and have been blocked by court rulings in Alabama, Kansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma. A ban approved in Texas will take effect in September and is also being challenged in court. The groups said the ban would have a devastating impact.

""The threatened harm to Dr. Hopkins and the fraction of women for whom the mandate is relevant clearly outweighs whatever damage or harm a proposed injunction may cause the State of Arkansas,"" Baker wrote in her ruling.

The groups praised Baker's ruling, saying the laws would have effectively banned abortion for many women.

""Arkansas women can feel a little relief today, knowing that these laws are blocked from taking effect,"" Rita Sklar, executive director of the ACLU of Arkansas, said in a statement. ""Instead of protecting women's health, Arkansas politicians have passed laws that defy decency and reason just to make it difficult or impossible for a woman to get an abortion.""

Judd Deere, a spokesman for Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, said in a text message that Rutledge disagrees with the ruling and plans to appeal.

Baker's ruling also halts a law that would impose new restrictions on the disposal of fetal tissue from abortions. The plaintiffs argued that it could also block access by requiring notification of a third party, such as the woman's sexual partner or her parents, to determine what happens to the fetal remains. The state has said the law doesn't require permission or notice from those third parties before an abortion and includes several provisions that ensure notice or consent isn't required to dispose of the fetal remains.

Baker said there was no evidence contradicting the groups' claims about the impact of complying with the tissue disposal requirements.

""The law mandates disclosure to a woman's partner or spouse, even if that person is no longer in her life or is a perpetrator of sexual assault,"" Baker wrote. ""For minor women, it bypasses the state's constitutionally mandated judicial bypass process, through which a minor can choose not to involve her parent in her abortion decision and instead obtain judicial authorization.""

Baker also blocked part of a law set to take effect in January that would ban abortions based solely on the fetus' sex. The groups challenged the law's requirement that a doctor performing the abortion first request records related to the entire pregnancy history of the woman.

""It will cause women to forgo abortion in Arkansas rather than risk disclosure to medical providers who they know oppose abortion or who are family friends or neighbors,"" Baker wrote.

The judge also blocked a law that would expand a requirement that physicians performing abortions for patients under 14 take certain steps to preserve embryonic or fetal tissue and notify police where the minor resides. The new measure, which was also set to take effect Tuesday, would have raised the age requirement to less than 17 years of age.

The ruling came hours after a federal appeals court panel cleared the way for Arkansas to enforce a law that will limit how the abortion pill can be administered. The panel lifted Baker's order blocking the 2015 law requiring doctors who provide such pills to maintain a contract with another physician who has admitting privileges at a hospital and who agrees to handle any complications. The state can't enforce the abortion pill restrictions until the appeals panel's ruling takes effect in about two or three weeks.

But now she's experiencing a major step in her long recovery: seeing her parents clearly for the very first time.

Juliana weighed 1 pound and 11 ounces when she was born prematurely at 25 weeks. Her parents, Julie and Jevon McBride, were in a head-on collision on Oct. 7, 2016, when she was still in utero. Juliana was born in an emergency cesarean section a day after the accident.

Father, mother and daughter all suffered numerous injuries in the collision. While Juliana sustained intraventricular bleeding, or bleeding in the brain, Julie McBride suffered a concussion along with a right hip contusion. Jevon McBride, 32, had his right leg completely shattered, including a broken femur, tibia and ankle.

""They didn't think she would make it,"" Julie McBride, 31, told ABC News of her daughter. ""They weren’t given us that much hope.""

""I tried my best to shield Julie's stomach from the impact,"" Jevon McBride, an Air Force staff sergeant, added. ""I grabbed her stomach immediately to try and shield whatever I could.""

“ ” I tried my best to shield Julie's stomach from the impact...

The accident was even tougher to endure for the Warrensburg, Missouri, couple, who had been trying to have their first child for 10 years.

After months of recovering, the couple got a glimmer of hope last week. Their daughter was able to see them clearly after being outfitted with purple glasses at a local optometrist.

In a video that's now gone viral, little Juliana is looking up at her dad, even cracking a smile.

Julie McBride said she gave her daughter to her husband in that moment because ""both of them had it worst in the accident...while she's learning how to crawl, he's learning how to walk again.""

She added that her husband can now walk with the help of crutches or his daughter's stroller.

“ ” She can really see. You can tell she's seeing things differently.

The new mom, who's also a teacher at Whiteman Air Force Base, said she recorded the special moment because she knew it'd be precious.

""She's just looking up at him like, 'Wow, you're my dad. You're really my dad,'"" Julie McBride said. ""She can really see. You can tell she's seeing things differently.""

Jevon McBride added, ""It was beautiful honestly because I could tell she was looking at me. I could see her eyes focusing on me.""

Juliana's recovery is far from over. After being outfitted with glasses, the baby, who was diagnosed with retinopathy of prematurity, a disease affecting premature babies that can lead to blindness, will need to undergo surgery on her eyes.

She's already had brain surgery and several blood transfusions.

""You don’t want your child to go through another surgery, but when she got the glasses and I saw her reaction, I said to myself, 'This is going to be OK,'"" Julie McBride said. ""We’ve already been through the worst. This is nothing.""

Jevon McBride said he hopes that when his daughter grows up, she realizes that ""the sky is the limit. I fully mean that."""

Mainly written by guitarist Robby Krieger, with a little help from his fellow Doors, the hit song was the first he composed for the group.

Krieger told ABC News that he and his band mates always knew ""Light My Fire"" was one of their best tunes ""because whenever we'd play it people would just go crazy.""

The Doors, however, were initially hesitant to release it as a single because the original version was seven minutes long. In order to have it played on AM radio, the track would have to be edited down to about three minutes.

""People were telling us, 'Oh, you gotta cut that instrumental part [in the middle of the song] out,'"" Robby recalled with a laugh. ""But we didn't want to because that was our favorite part.""

Krieger said it was a Los Angeles DJ named Dave Diamond who convinced the band to release ""Light My Fire"" as a single, telling them how much his listeners loved it when he played the full version on his station.

""Light My Fire"" spent three weeks at No. 1 on the Hot 100 list and went on to sell more than 927,000 copies in the U.S. It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998.

As previously reported, The Doors are asking fans and radio stations to celebrate the anniversary by playing ""Light My Fire"" at 7:29 p.m. local time on Saturday.

In addition, a limited-edition vinyl single is being released today featuring the single version of ""Light My Fire"" on one side and ""The Crystal Ship"" on the other."

The Tennessee State Board of Education announced its decision to strip Tad Cummins, 50, of his license Friday morning, ABC affiliate WKRN reported. Because of the ruling, Cummins will never be able to obtain a teaching license again.

Cummins and the female student were discovered in a remote part of northern California on April 20 after he spent over a month on the run with her. Officials at the time said the teen was ""healthy and unharmed.""

The married father and grandfather went missing with the student on March 13. An Amber Alert was issued for the young woman, and Cummins was wanted on allegations of aggravated kidnapping and sexual contact with a minor.

Cummins faces two federal charges of obstruction of justice and transporting a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activities. Prosecutors allege that he planned to flee to Mexico with the teen.

He also faces charges in Tennessee of kidnapping and sexual contact with a minor after he allegedly kissed the student while at school.

Cummins, who has remained in custody since his arrest, pleaded not guilty to the charges in late May.

Imam Ammar Shahin apologized during a news conference Friday in Davis, California, saying he let his emotions cloud his judgment, the Los Angeles Times reported (http://lat.ms/2ha5HgI).

In a July 21 sermon, Shahin condoned the annihilation of Jews and those restricting access to the Al-Aqsa Mosque.

Israeli officials installed metal detectors at the mosque's entrances after Arab gunmen on July 14 shot and killed two police officers in the site that is holy to both Muslims and Jews. The move outraged Muslims and sparked some of the worst street clashes in years. Five Palestinians died in the past week and scores were wounded in violent clashes with Israeli security forces over the holy site.

Friday prayers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque attended by tens of thousands ended peacefully.

Shahin's sermon to worshippers at the Islamic Center of Davis set off a firestorm of criticism after a videotaped excerpt was translated and distributed.

""I said things that were hurtful to Jews. This was unacceptable,"" Shahin said, flanked by religious and community leaders during a news conference in that was part of an effort to ease tensions.

""I hope to grow and develop as a more worthy leader in the community,"" he added.

Rabbi Seth Castleman of Davis thanked Shahin for his words and asked him to follow through with actions. ""Apologies are only as worthy as the actions that follow, so I call upon you. I implore you to follow those words with actions,"" Castleman said."
http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/florida-health-care-admin-charged-1b-medicare-fraud-48925669,go,Florida health care admin charged in $1B Medicare fraud case,['Abc News'],"A Florida health care administrator accepted bribes in exchange for helping a nursing home owner accused of orchestrating a $1 billion Medicare and Medicaid fraud scheme keep his license, federal prosecutors said.

Bertha Blanco, 66, faces federal criminal charges in a wide-ranging investigation that federal authorities are calling the nation's biggest health fraud case, The Miami Herald reported . She was charged earlier this month.

Blanco made about $31,300 a year overseeing inspections at nursing facilities owned by 48-year-old Philip Esformes, an extremely wealthy businessman who owns dozens of Miami-Dade nursing facilities as well as homes in Miami, Los Angeles and Chicago, prosecutors said.

A criminal complaint filed against Blanco accused her of taking tens of thousands of dollars in cash in exchange for tipping Esformes off about violations so he could address them before state inspections.

Blanco's aid allowed Esformes to keep his license active and continue billing the federal government for questionable patient services, the complaint alleged.

Blanco, a 29-year veteran of the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration, is the first of its employees ever to be charged with taking bribes, the newspaper reported.

Blanco's attorney Robyn Blake told the newspaper she is reviewing the case and deciding whether to go to trial or bargain a plea deal. Blanco is out of custody on a $250,000 bond.

Federal authorities say Blanco took the bribes and provided patient and inspection records to intermediaries, who delivered the information to Esformes.

Esformes is being held in federal detention and is scheduled to go to trial in March. His attorneys have argued that the intermediaries to whom Blanco delivered the information acted without his knowledge.

Two of those intermediaries, brothers Gabriel and Guillermo Delgado, have made plea deals and are expected to testify against Esformes. The brothers helped investigators get to Esformes by videotaping a cash transaction that prosecutors said was meant to go for bribes.

Esformes is accused of using his 20 nursing facilities to file false Medicare and Medicaid claims for services that were not necessary for 14,000 patients.

Prosecutors said his health care network and other co-conspirators billed $1 billion for fraudulent services between 2009 and 2016.

ABC’s LOUISE SIMPSON: The Iowa State Fair’s ties to politics goes all the way back to

the ‘50s. Eight presidents have visited the fair – either in office, as candidates, or having left office.

Herbert Hoover: Former President Hoover visited the fair in 1954 at its centennial with then-President Eisenhower. The Fair’s 100th anniversary celebration included a horse caravan with 509 people and 471 horses. A 20-foot time capsule called the Centurlon was created, and will be unearthed at the 2054 State Fair.

Dwight D. Eisenhower: Eisenhower attended the 1954 Fair with Hoover early into his presidency. He gave an address, in which he said, “I saw in a squib in the paper that there was some anxiety, if not irritation, because it was said I was not going to pay my fifty cents to get into the Fair. Now, on behalf of a former President of the United States and myself, I hereby tender to Governor Beardsley one dollar, and hope that he will pass it on to the proper authorities,” which was met with laughter.

Gerald Ford: Then-President Ford made an appearance at the Fair in 1975, themed, “The Colonizers.” The fair that year featured a British premier show with English singers, artists and folk dancers. There was a Machine Area, where one had the opportunity to pay for a slot to exhibit machinery in a large arena. Ford gave a speech to 10,000 in the Grandstand, saying, “First, I'd like to congratulate Ken [Falk, Secretary of the Fair] for the fine job that he has done with the arrangements for the fair. Since I don't qualify for kid's day, free admission, I will gladly give Ken my $2 to pay my way in.”

Richard Nixon: Nixon attended the Fair in 1960 as a presidential candidate against John F. Kennedy, and posed for a picture with two ears of corn.

Jimmy Carter: Then-candidate Jimmy Carter attended the Fair in 1976, and gave a speech on agriculture after the “Lemonade and Peanuts” gathering on the farm.

Ronald Reagan: Reagan attended the Fair long before he was president in the 1930s as a sports broadcaster for WHO Radio. He broadcasted baseball games and was named WHO’s sports director. The Fair recreated WHO Radio in 1987, and continues to broadcast live during the Fair.

George W. Bush: Bush attended the Fair as president in 2002. He was quoted as saying, “I came off my ranch today in Crawford. There are not many places that would kind of lure me away, but the Iowa State Fair is one.”



Barack Obama: Most recently, Obama attended the Fair in 2007 as a candidate and 2012 as the president running for re-election. In 2008, he brought the First Lady and their two daughters, where they rode the rides and ate caramel corn. Obama even won the endorsement of Norma Lyon, the Butter-Cow Lady. In 2012, he ate pork on a stick and bought 10 people beers as chants of “Four More Years!” turned to “Four More Beers!”"
http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/mississippi-federal-probe-requested-mans-shooting-death-48917959,go,Mississippi: Federal probe requested in man's shooting death,['Abc News'],"Lawyers for the family of a Mississippi man fatally shot by police called Friday on the Justice Department to investigate, saying they believe the man's death was an execution.

Murray Wells, the attorney for the wife and son of Ismael Lopez, said officers involved in Lopez's death last weekend in the Mississippi city of Southaven should face criminal charges.

Earlier this week, District Attorney John Champion of northern Mississippi's DeSoto County said that two officers were present Sunday evening when Lopez was shot at his home in Southaven. According to Champion, police said they fired their weapons after a pit bull dog burst out of the house as they searched for a suspect — and after a man pointed a gun at them through an open door.

But Wells is disputing the account given by authorities. The lawyer said he has hired investigators and has spoken to neighbors of Lopez, an auto mechanic originally from Veracruz, Mexico, who came to the U.S. seeking a better life two decades ago and had never been in trouble with authorities.

Wells has said recently that police didn't have a warrant for Lopez and were at the wrong address. He also has said Lopez was shot through a closed front door. And Lopez, though a gun owner, didn't have a gun in his hand when he was killed, according to the attorney.

""We think it was an execution,"" Wells said at a news conference Friday at his Memphis office. ""Now, when you're firing through a door, we think it complicates things. Physical evidence says their story isn't true.""

Local media organizations have reported that a sheriff of a neighboring county said his agency had requested that Southaven police look for a domestic violence suspect who was not Lopez.

Wells said a lawyer from his firm has looked at the body with permission of the man's family and it appears Lopez was shot in the back of the head. He acknowledged that the determination of where Lopez was shot was that of his firm and doesn't come from any coroner or doctor. An autopsy report hasn't been released and authorities said a final autopsy report could take up to eight weeks.

""This man died running away from people who were trespassing on his premises,"" Wells told reporters.

The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is investigating and will turn its findings over to the district attorney, Champion, who can decide whether to pursue charges.

Police have referred questions to the bureau, which did not immediately return a call seeking comment. The DeSoto County's coroner also didn't immediately return a call seeking comment.

Wells says police and city officials are covering up facts in the case. He also called for the resignation of the Southaven police chief ans well as the officers involved in the shooting.

Wells says he will send the Justice Department a letter asking federal investigators to step in.

In a statement read in English and Spanish by two of the firm's lawyers, Lopez's family said he was a loving husband and father, a hard worker and a mentor to others in the community.

""There is no reasonable explanation about why or how this happened to our Ismael, but we believe his memory demands answers, accountability and justice,"" it said."
http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/best-honeymoon-destinations-europe/story?id=48909560,go,7 best honeymoon destinations in Europe,"['Abc News', 'Toorton']","Oyster.com After months -- or even years -- of organizing, stressing and saving for a wedding, couples finally get to kick back and relax during their honeymoon. In the U.S. alone, there are an estimated 1.4 million honeymooners per year, and in the last five years, 75 percent of newlyweds opted for vacations in the U.S. or Canada. But what about the other 25 percent? Europe is a popular honeymoon option, but in a diverse continent bursting with destinations, where should one go? From the food, wine, and dolce vita vibe of the Amalfi Coast to the pampering serenity of the Greek islands, here are seven of the best honeymoon destinations in Europe.

Oyster.com 1. Santorini Santorini, with its whitewashed buildings, rustic coastal paths, gorgeous Aegean Sea views and delicious seafood, offers the ideal place to unwind after the stresses of a wedding. Here, visitors can swim and snorkel from chartered yachts, explore the island’s pretty villages, and dine in traditional trattorias. To top it off, a warm climate ensures that you can spend as much time as you want on the beautiful beaches. A favorite with the celebrity crowd, this Greek island gifts you an overall slow-paced honeymoon.

Oyster.com 2. Florence The capital of Tuscany, Florence, is the best place to base yourself for a honeymoon that combines city culture and beautiful countryside views. Walking around the city is the best way to soak up its atmospheric charms. Must-see highlights include the Duomo, Museo di San Marco, the Palazzo Vecchio, and the Uffizi art gallery. From Michelangelo to mozzarella, art and food are two of Florence’s great loves, and fine dining can be found in even the most basic family restaurants. After exploring the city, make a break for the Tuscan hills with a tour through the Chianti trail, where red wine and sunsets provide the ultimate romantic experience.

Oyster.com 3. Amalfi Coast While the Amalfi Coast is a hugely popular destination, the attractions in this beautiful region are fairly dispersed, which means you don’t have to spend your honeymoon squished shoulder-to-shoulder with other couples. Glamorous and quintessentially Italian, the Amalfi Coast is filled with hidden bays, stunning cliff walks and quaint villages. There are also scenic drives to take. Some of the best views can be seen from the roads between Positano and Ravello, where a lush landscape hides olive groves, secret forests and historic buildings. For a romantic day trip, take the hydrofoil from Positano to Capri, an island that hums with dolce-vita style.

Oyster.com 4. Amsterdam While Santorini and the Amalfi Coast offer a perfect climate and parade of great beaches (and plenty more), Amsterdam guarantees neither -- though summers in the Netherlands are generally warm and sunny. However, what the Netherlands’ most famous city can provide is charming cobblestone streets, beautiful canals, amazing parks, lots of culture and buzzing nightlife. Don’t be put off by Amsterdam’s reputation as a party mecca -- beyond the red light district, this is a city that oozes romance. From bike rides through the quirky Jordaan neighborhood to paddle boat rides on the Amstel river and its canals to roaming the tight, tree-lined streets, this city serves up a whimsical honeymoon escape.

Oyster.com 5. Antibes The Cote d’Azur is scattered with picturesque places, but few are more romantic than Antibes. Located a short drive from Nice and Cannes, this town was loved by artists like Monet and Picasso -- and it’s not hard to see why they gained inspiration from its beauty. Overflowing with floral displays and hidden gardens, the narrow streets are a sight to behold. Beyond the ramparts of the town, the port walls welcome super yachts of the rich and famous and hide a small sandy beach, which gets very busy during the summer. The other great thing about Antibes is its location. While it offers fine restaurants, relaxing walks, artsy enclaves, and some of the sweetest wine bars you’ll find on the Riviera, it also doles out plenty of beaches, including the long Plage du Ponteil and the relatively quiet and serene Plage des Ondes.

Oyster.com 6. Dubrovnik Croatia is no longer Europe’s hidden gem, but it still feels like you’re discovering something new every time you visit. The mix of beautiful beaches, medieval old towns, and clear blue water make Croatia a no-brainer for couples who are searching for a romantic honeymoon destination. We recommend Dubrovnik, a city that has developed into Croatia’s luxury capital. Explore the pedestrian-only Old Town and visit its ancient churches and medieval ramparts. Or, while away the days on the beautiful beaches, which are lapped by the clear water of the Adriatic Sea. Don’t forget to enjoy some island hopping to the nearby Elaphiti Islands, where snorkeling and diving are encouraged between destinations."

In fact, “Game of Thrones” star Emilia Clarke, who has an unknown role in the closely-guarded production, shared a video Friday of the new Chewbacca, now played by Joonas Suotamo, in a role originated by Peter Mayhew.

The actress posted a video of the ""Star Wars"" icon to celebrate reaching 10 million followers on Instagram.

Clarke began her caption with: ""In a Instagram far far away...(Or in pinewood backlot filming #untitledhansolomovie).""

The actress then gushed about her co-star Suotamo.

""You are more than just a cute nose and lotta hair to me,"" she wrote.

This is just the latest behind-the-scenes look at the untitled film, which stars Alden Ehrenreich as Solo, and Donald Glover as a young Lando Calrissian. Woody Harrelson also stars in the film, out next May, as Garris Shrike.

Director Ron Howard, who took over for filmmakers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller after they exited the project, also recently shared a photo from the set.

""Working out a shot w/cinematographer Bradford Young for #UntitledHanSoloMovie,"" he tweeted Friday along with a photo.

Earlier this month, he hinted at what the film's plot could be about when he shared a photo on Twitter with the caption, ""#Chewie checking the shot. #UntitledHanSoloMovie.""

Excited fans noticed that on the screen, Chewbacca was seemingly embracing another Wookiee.

Howard, 63, also shared a photo of Glover, 33, on set in June. He captioned that sneak peek, ""lining up a shot today from my director's monitor.""

Abdihakim Hussein, 19, was injured on the ride when it broke apart mid-air, but he didn't know it at first, he told ABC News today. One teenager was killed and several others were injured in the incident.

Hussein and his girlfriend, 20-year-old Hannah Sallee, were riding beside the car that came apart when they noticed the floor of their car lift up.

""I was like, 'That's not supposed to happen,'"" she told ABC News. Then, the car next to them broke apart.

""When the piece broke off… I was kind of shocked because the ride was still going,"" he said. ""And I'm thinking, 'It's going to be us next.'""

The Fire Ball swings riders 40 feet in the air while spinning them at 13 revolutions per minute, according to amusement park operator Amusements of America. Hussein and Sallee had originally sat in the car that malfunctioned, but had switched cars before the ride started, they said.

""If we never would have switched it [our seats], that would've been us,"" he said.

Sallee said the pair attended the fair with her godchildren, who she says ""saw those people flying through the air.""

Once the ride ""finally stopped,"" Sallee says she helped to carry a woman who appeared to be unconscious away from the scene and put pressure on her bleeding head until medics arrived, she said. She went on to criticize first responders.

""There was officers all around -- why wasn't anyone coming up here to help us get off the ride?"" she said. ""There was so many people. It should've been done way faster.""

Sallee said the woman she was assisting never regained consciousness at the scene. She added that she hopes she's OK.

""I want to know what went wrong,"" she said.

Hussein has a fracture to the back of his neck, he said. He didn't realize he was in pain until he tried to get out of the seat, which was still locked. The pain kicked in when he began to walk, he said.

It was Hussein's first time on any type amusement park ride, he said. He called the experience ""terrifying.""

Tyler Jarrell, 18, was killed, and seven more injured Wednesday evening, according to Ohio State Highway Patrol.

Jarrell's family is seeking justice for his death and plans to file a wrongful death lawsuit, the family attorney, Mark Kitrick, said in a statement. Kitrick did not disclose in the statement who will be named in the lawsuit.

“Everyone who knew Tyler is grief-stricken and in shock,” said Jarrell's mother, Amber Duffield. “We just need to know how and why this happened, and whether it could have been avoided. We hope our demand for real answers will save others from being hurt or killed because of bad or dangerous amusement park rides.”

Amber Duffield

“Tyler was a good young man, with a bright future ahead of him,” Kitrick said. “This was a senseless, tragic incident that likely could have been avoided. Our only goal in filing a wrongful death suit is to obtain justice for Tyler.”

As of Friday, two people remained in critical condition and two others were in serious condition, local hospitals announced in statements.

""I just feel so bad for the families,"" Sallee said. ""It's just such a sad situation.""

Amusements of America, which owns the Fire Ball attraction, released a statement earlier this week regarding the incident.

""Our family owned company is committed to working with state and local experts in trying to determine the cause of this tragic accident,"" Amusements of America said. ""The ride was inspected by our staff as well as independent inspectors prior to opening at the Ohio State Fair. We are keeping those impacted by this tragic situation in our prayers and cooperating with those investigating this accident.""

Obdulia Sanchez, 18, of Stockton, California, stood before a Merced County judge on Friday, wiping away tears as her defense attorney asked that she either be released or her bail be reduced from $560,000. Ramnik Samrao, a public defender, said he believes the bail amount is ""excessive"" considering the teen spent the past few years in foster care living in a group home and has no way of raising that amount of money, according to ABC Fresno affiliate KFSN-TV.

""The family is behind her being released, they're not mad at her. They don't blame her. The surviving passenger, Manuela, made a public statement that she's not mad at her -- she's not afraid of her,"" Samrao said.

According to the California Highway Patrol, Sanchez was driving on July 21 in Los Banos, about 80 miles southeast of San Jose, when the car went through a barbed wire fence and overturned in a field, ejecting the two passengers.

The passengers were both 14 years old and were not wearing seat belts; one was killed and the other has a major injury, the highway patrol said.

KFSN reported that Sanchez was livestreaming video on Instagram when the crash occurred. Video before the crash shows her singing and dancing along to music as she drives.

In live video following the crash, Sanchez references the victim as her sister.

""I ------- killed my sister,"" Sanchez says in the video, according to KFSN. ""I know I’m going to jail for life. ... I don't ------- care at all.""

Chuck Mosley, commander of the highway patrol in Los Banos, confirmed the authenticity of the video obtained by KFSN. He told ABC News, ""We do know she was livestreaming via social media at the time of the collision.""

The highway patrol said alcohol is believed to be a factor in the crash.

Sanchez was arrested and booked at the Merced County Jail, where she is being held on charges of DUI alcohol/drugs causing bodily injury and gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated.

According to KFSN, Sanchez has pleaded not guilty to six felony charges. She is scheduled to appear in court in August."

A Chicago-area hospital said they are experiencing a baby boom about nine months after the Cubs' historic victory, which was 108 years in the making.

“You can definitely say it's been a little busy around the hospital,” Dr. Melissa Dennis, vice chairwoman of obstetrics and gynecology at Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center, told ABC News. “The number of births nearly doubled in the last few weeks, from an average of five births per day to nine.”

The medical team there celebrated on Wednesday by dressing newborns in the team's onesies and arranging a photo shoot with their families, the Cubs' trophy, and Clark, the team's mascot.

Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center

Natalie and Joe Pelnar, diehard fans and born-and-raised Chicagoans, were thrilled to welcome a little Cubby to their family. The Pelnars named their son Addison for Wrigley Field’s historic cross streets, Clark and Addison.

“We wanted to give him a name of something that would be around for a long time,” Joe Pelnar, 25, told ABC News. “Players come and go, but hopefully those street names will stay there forever.”

The proud new parents, who delivered Addison at a sister hospital, Advocate Good Shepherd Hospital in Barrington, Illinois, said they conceived him on the day the Cubs made it to the World Series by beating the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 6.

“They made this one huge step and we said, ‘Let’s go for it,’” Natalie Pelnar, 24, said. “We had just gotten married, so we said, We’ll try this one time.’”

Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center

It turns out the Cubs were their lucky charm. The day after the Cubs took home the World Series championship, the Pelnars found out Natalie was pregnant.

“We had been celebrating with him the whole time and not knowing,” said Natalie Pelnar. “We didn’t know what to be happy for -- the World Series or us being pregnant. It was a huge moment for us.”

Another couple, Chris and Jenna Grooms, said they conceived their daughter, Rose, during the final week of the World Series.

“By that last winning night, I would have been pregnant, so Rose got to celebrate with us in that moment and we didn’t even know it,” Jenna Grooms, who gave birth a week late on July 25, said. “It was pretty incredible. Living in Chicago for that final game was awesome. As soon as they won, immediately outside horns were honking and people were driving down the street with radios and music playing. The energy was so incredible.”

The Grooms live a mile and a half away from Wrigley Field and said their daughter “doesn’t even have a choice” but to be a “Cubs fan forever.”

Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center

Dennis explained that while there has been an increase in the number of babies delivered, “it’s tough to definitively tie it back to the World Series win last fall.”

Nonetheless, “it's been fun to relive that amazing moment in history and celebrate these new babies and their Cubs-loving families,” she added. “With the hospital just a hop and a skip away from Wrigley Field, and as a Cubs fan myself, I'm used to seeing the Cubs spirit everywhere I go. But having these families here to celebrate their 'little sluggers' in such a special way is absolutely unforgettable."""

http://liveblog.abcnews.go.com/Event/Live_Updates_Election_Day_2016_2,go,Live Updates: Election Day 2016,['Abc News'],"ABC’s ADAM KELSEY

Four years ago, President Barack Obama won reelection over former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney by a margin of 332-206 electoral votes.



Television networks began to call the election for Obama shortly after 11 pm, when a combined 74 electoral votes came in for the president upon the closure of polls in California, Oregon and Washington, and 18 votes from Ohio -- which had been too-close-to-call since closing earlier in the night -- put the Democrat over the top.



Despite the apparent results, Romney waited almost three more hours to call Obama to concede, leaving the candidates to give their concession and victory speeches early Wednesday morning. Romney, expecting victory, reportedly did not draft a concession speech in advance, eschewing the norm of preparing two speeches.



Both candidates urged the political parties to work together in the aftermath of the election.



“The nation, as you know, is at a critical point. At a time like this, we can't risk partisan bickering and political posturing,” said Romney. “Our leaders have to reach across the aisle to do the people's work.”



Added Obama, “I believe we can seize this future together because we are not as divided as our politics suggests. We're not as cynical as the pundits believe. We are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions, and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states. We are and forever will be the United States of America.”"

http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/wireStory/apnewsbreak-yellowstone-park-cracks-sex-harassment-48917560,go,APNewsBreak: Yellowstone park cracks down on sex harassment,['Abc News'],"As many as 10 workers in Yellowstone National Park's maintenance division will be disciplined after an investigation found female employees were subjected to sexual harassment and other problems.

The move comes as widespread reports of harassment, bullying and other misconduct have tarnished the image of the National Park Service and its parent agency, the U.S. Interior Department.

Investigators have uncovered problems at many of the nation's premier parks — Yellowstone, Yosemite, the Grand Canyon, Canaveral National Seashore — as well as inappropriate behavior toward female employees by the Interior Department's former director of law enforcement.

A report on sexual harassment at Florida's De Soto National Memorial, which is run by the park service, was released this week by an employee advocacy group that got the document through a public records request.

At Yellowstone, the Interior Department's Office of Inspector General launched its investigation last year, after a park employee complained to a local magazine and members of Congress that a pervasive ""men's club"" environment had encouraged the exploitation and abuse of female workers.

The inspector general's investigation also found that government-issued charge cards in the maintenance division had been misused. Yellowstone Superintendent Dan Wenk said the punishments stem from both harassment and charge-card misuse but declined to be more specific, citing employee privacy.

The review was shared with park officials on March 13. More than four months later, the personnel actions will be handed down and could range from letters of counseling or reprimand, to suspensions or firing, Wenk said. The workers can appeal before the penalties, to be proposed by Aug. 1 or soon afterward, become final.

A letter of counseling is not considered a disciplinary action, Wenk said.

Since the harassment allegations emerged last year, park supervisors have undergone mandatory sexual harassment training. Similar training is happening this summer for all seasonal and permanent employees.

In disclosing the upcoming discipline, Wenk echoed prior comments of senior officials within the park service and Interior: They're trying to change an embedded culture that has allowed misconduct to proliferate.

""I'm concerned that people understand what acceptable behavior in the workplace is,"" Wenk said. ""We're setting out very clear expectations for how people comport themselves.""

Investigators found that between 2010 and 2016, six women who previously worked in the maintenance division had faced derogatory comments or actions that made them feel uncomfortable. They said the division's supervisor described the culture at Yellowstone as a ""good old boy system"" that was rampant in the 1990s but has improved over time.

The park is taking other steps, including instituting a new policy intended to curb the misuse of alcohol by employees after hours at remote work locations. And there will be a park-wide audit of employees' use of charge cards, Wenk said.

There's been no indication Wenk, who became superintendent in 2011, knew about the allegations at Yellowstone and ignored them. He has said he first became aware of them just before an article published last September in The Montana Pioneer.

The superintendents of Yosemite and the Grand Canyon retired in recent months following allegations of sexual harassment and hostile work environments.

At least 18 Yosemite employees came forward with allegations, and working conditions were said to be so bad that they were labeled ""toxic."" At the Grand Canyon, male employees reportedly preyed on female colleagues, demanded sex and retaliated against women who refused.

The superintendent of Canaveral National Seashore in Florida was put on paid leave last year amid allegations that the park's former chief ranger, Edwin Correa, sexually harassed three employees over five years.

Correa agreed to perform 50 hours of community service to resolve a misdemeanor charge after he was accused of kissing and touching another ranger against her will, the Dayton Beach News-Journal reported in June.

He was no longer employed as of May 12, the park service said. Canaveral Superintendent Myrna Palfrey returned to work May 28 after no wrongdoing on her part was found, the agency said.

The Interior Department's law enforcement director, Tim Lynn, retired this spring after investigators disclosed in February that he had displayed a ""pattern of unprofessional behavior"" by touching and hugging female employees and making flirtatious remarks.

At De Soto National Memorial in Bradenton, Florida, a female employee reported that a male employee inappropriately touched her and made unwanted comments numerous times, according to a Feb. 6 inspector general's report obtained by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility.

The employees' names were redacted. The report said the case was referred to federal prosecutors, who declined to pursue charges.

The head of the employee advocacy group said the disclosure of the De Soto investigation underscored that such problems remain entrenched despite the planned actions at Yellowstone and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's pledge to show zero tolerance toward sexual harassment.

""The park service still doesn't get it,"" executive director Jeff Ruch said. ""Generally, the high-level managers and supervisors escape responsibility and (the agencies) are more than willing to take action against lower-level people.""

Zinke spokeswoman Heather Swift said the actions at Yellowstone reflect that leaders of individual parks feel newly empowered to confront harassment.

""His (Zinke's) leadership will create a culture where people are valued for their work and not discriminated against,"" Swift said.

The bear's two cubs were captured and will be relocated to a zoo in Oakland, California.

Dick Shideler, a state wildlife biologist, squarely placed blame for the bear's demise on Deadhorse residents not using bear-proof garbage cans.

He says people need to stop placing food waste in unsecured bins, a practice that made this bear conditioned to human-provided food.

The grizzly killed is well-known to researchers on the North Slope. She was known as ""Bear 147,"" and spent her life around Deadhorse and the nearby Prudhoe Bay oilfields.

This is the first lethal removal of a bear in Deadhorse, located about 10 miles south of Alaska's northern coast, since seven bears were killed in 2001-2002."

They charm us and bring happiness, fragrance, and beauty to our lives. These baby names inspired by flowers are lovely, and many of them are gender neutral, suitable for both boys and girls. Naming your child after one of the most beautiful things in nature is a lovely thing. I’m a big fan of flower names!

In the late 19th century, naming babies after flowers, plants, and trees was the thing to do and a popular trend. Parents have been using many of these names for years, and celebrities are just a few of the people who have jumped on the flower naming trend. Jamie Oliver’s wife, Jules Oliver, is a big fan of flower names and chose names pertaining to flowers for all three of her girls — Poppy, Daisy, and Petal — while Ben Affleck and his wife Jennifer Garner famously named their eldest daughter Violet.

From Begonia and Zinnia to Aster and Yarrow, these are 50 of the sweetest baby names inspired by flowers."

http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/oregon-scientists-human-gene-embryo-editing-us-48882536,go,"In US first, scientists edit genes of human embryos",['Abc News'],"For the first time in the United States, scientists have edited the genes of human embryos, a controversial step toward someday helping babies avoid inherited diseases.

The experiment was just an exercise in science — the embryos were not allowed to develop for more than a few days and were never intended to be implanted into a womb, according to MIT Technology Review, which first reported the news.

Officials at Oregon Health & Science University confirmed Thursday that the work took place there and said results would be published in a journal soon. It is thought to be the first such work in the U.S.; previous experiments like this have been reported from China. How many embryos were created and edited in the experiments has not been revealed.

The Oregon scientists reportedly used a technique called CRISPR, which allows specific sections of DNA to be altered or replaced. It's like using a molecular scissors to cut and paste DNA, and is much more precise than some types of gene therapy that cannot ensure that desired changes will take place exactly where and as intended. With gene editing, these so-called ""germline"" changes are permanent and would be passed down to any offspring.

The approach holds great potential to avoid many genetic diseases, but has raised fears of ""designer babies"" if done for less lofty reasons, such as producing desirable traits.

Last year, Britain said some of its scientists could edit embryo genes to better understand human development.

And earlier this year in the U.S., the National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Medicine said in a report that altering the genes of embryos might be OK if done under strict criteria and aimed at preventing serious disease.

""This is the kind of research that the report discussed,"" University of Wisconsin-Madison bioethicist R. Alta Charo said of the news of Oregon's work. She co-led the National Academies panel but was not commenting on its behalf Thursday.

""This was purely laboratory-based work that is incredibly valuable for helping us understand how one might make these germline changes in a way that is precise and safe. But it's only a first step,"" she said.

""We still have regulatory barriers in the United States to ever trying this to achieve a pregnancy. The public has plenty of time"" to weigh in on whether that should occur, she said. ""Any such experiment aimed at a pregnancy would need FDA approval, and the agency is currently not allowed to even consider such a request"" because of limits set by Congress.

One prominent genetics expert, Dr. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Translational Science Institute in La Jolla, California, said gene editing of embryos is ""an unstoppable, inevitable science, and this is more proof it can be done.""

Experiments are in the works now in the U.S. using gene-edited cells to try to treat people with various diseases, but ""in order to really have a cure, you want to get this at the embryo stage,"" he said. ""If it isn't done in this country, it will be done elsewhere.""

There are other ways that some parents who know they carry a problem gene can avoid passing it to their children, he added. They can create embryos through in vitro fertilization, screen them in the lab and implant only ones free of the defect.

Dr. Robert C. Green, a medical geneticist at Harvard Medical School, said the prospect of editing embryos to avoid disease ""is inevitable and exciting,"" and that ""with proper controls in place, it's going to lead to huge advances in human health.""

The need for it is clear, he added: ""Our research has suggested that there are far more disease-associated mutations in the general public than was previously suspected.""

Hank Greely, director of Stanford University's Center for Law and the Biosciences, called CRISPR ""the most exciting thing I've seen in biology in the 25 years I've been watching it,"" with tremendous possibilities to aid human health.

""Everybody should calm down"" because this is just one of many steps advancing the science, and there are regulatory safeguards already in place. ""We've got time to do it carefully,"" he said.

Michael Watson, executive director of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, said the college thinks that any work aimed at pregnancy is premature, but the lab work is a necessary first step.

""That's the only way we're going to learn"" if it's safe or feasible, he said.

http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/iran-us-navy-fires-warning-shots-vessels-48922177,go,Iran says US Navy fires warning shots near its vessels,['Abc News'],"Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard said Saturday a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier fired a warning shot in an ""unprofessional"" confrontation with Iranian vessels, the official IRNA news agency reported.

IRNA quoted a statement from the Guard as saying that the USS Nimitz and an accompanying ship came near an Iranian oil offshore platform in the Persian Gulf and a helicopter from the ship hovered near vessels manned by Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard.

The report said the confrontation took place Friday afternoon and the U.S. navy ships left the area following the encounter.

The U.S. Navy's Bahrain-based 5th Fleet said the incident happened while one of its helicopters was on a routine patrol in international airspace. The aircraft saw several Guard vessels approaching American ships ""at a high rate of speed"" and sent out flares after receiving no response when it tried to establish communications, the Navy said. That prompted the Iranian boats to halt their approach.

After communications were established, the U.S. saw the Iranians conduct a ""gun exercise."" That routine exercise involved them firing weapons into the water away from American ships, said Navy spokesman Lt. Ian M. McConnaughey.

The Navy described the encounter ""as safe and professional.""

The incident comes after a U.S. Navy patrol boat fired warning shots Tuesday near an Iranian vessel that American sailors said came dangerously close to them during a tense encounter.

Iran and the U.S. frequently have run-ins in the Persian Gulf, nearly all involving the Revolutionary Guard, a separate force from Iran's military that answers only to the country's supreme leader. In January, near the end of then-President Barack Obama's term, the USS Mahan fired shots toward Iranian fast-attack boats as they neared the destroyer in the Strait of Hormuz.

Iranian forces view the American presence in the Gulf as a provocation. They have accused the U.S. Navy of unprofessional behavior, especially in the Strait of Hormuz, the mouth of the Persian Gulf through which a third of all oil trade passes by sea.

Also Saturday, Iran's parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy held an urgent meeting with deputy foreign minister and senior Iranian negotiator Abbas Araghchi in which they reviewed measures that the country may apply in response to a package of sanctions the U.S. Senate approved Friday against Iran and sent to President Donald Trump for signing.

Araghchi told state TV Saturday that the decision is a ""hostile"" breach of the deal.

""It is a breach of the deal in articles 26, 28 and 29,"" said Araghchi. ""A strong answer will be given to the action by the U.S.""

The articles say the U.S. Administration, acting consistently with the respective roles of the President and Congress, will refrain from re-imposing the sanctions or any policy specifically intended to directly and adversely affect the normalization of trade and economic relations with Iran.

The U.S. legislation imposes mandatory penalties on people involved in Iran's ballistic missile program and anyone who does business with them. The measure would also apply terrorism sanctions to Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard and enforce an arms embargo. Democrats said the new sanctions would not conflict with the landmark 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers.

On Friday, the United States, France, Germany and Britain, who brokered the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran along with China, Russia and the European Union, said they're raising concerns with the United Nations over Iran's Thursday launch of a satellite-carrying rocket into space.

In a joint statement, they said that Iran's launch was ""inconsistent"" with a U.N. Security Council resolution that enshrined the nuclear deal.

On Saturday Iran's foreign ministry said the missile program is part of ""domestic policy of the country, deterrent and at service of regional peace and security.""

Tehran and Washington have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when Iranian militant students stormed the U.S. embassy and took 52 American hostages for 444 days.

The Cape Hatteras Electric Cooperative said in a press release that PCL Construction told the cooperative it had accidentally driven a steel casing into an underground electric transmission cable while working on the new Bonner Bridge on North Carolina's coast Thursday morning, cutting off power to Ocracoke and Hatteras islands.

Local officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for all visitors on Hatteras Island effective at 6 a.m. ET Saturday. The evacuation order includes the villages of Rodanthe, Waves, Salvo, Avon, Buxton, Frisco and Hatteras, according to ABC station WTVD.

Earlier in the week, local officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for all visitors on Ocracoke Island effective at 5 p.m. ET Thursday.

As of Saturday afternoon, the North Carolina Department of Transportation's ferry division had transported close to 3,800 people and 1,485 cars from both islands, the state governor's office said.

“Ensuring the safety of residents and visitors is our primary concern, but we know the loss of power has a significant economic impact as well,” Gov. Roy Cooper (D-NC) said on Friday. “Summer is the busiest time of year for our North Carolina coastal communities, and we know this outage is causing problems for locals, vacationers and businesses.”

Ethan Hyman/The News & Observer via AP

About 35,000 people live year-round in Dare County, where Hatteras Island is located, but during summer months the daily population is estimated to reach 225,000 to 300,000, according to the county website.

People in the area posted photos to social media showing how the darkness and lack of power affected their summer vacations.

The governor issued a state of emergency for both islands Thursday night.

PCL Construction said it is working ""around-the-clock"" with Cape Hatteras Electric Cooperative and state officials to make the necessary repairs to restore power to the islands ""as quickly as possible.""

""The damage is estimated to be approximately 9 feet below ground level,"" the construction company said in a statement Saturday. ""The crews have recently exposed the affected area and have begun investigating the damage. Electrical experts are currently initiating and assessing options for repairs."""

He soon not way you know built up my understanding of of the world's movers taking on. And then was freed us and create fictional characters and figure in my home through. Nobody in this movie sits down and says and here's what happened and my mother was cruel to. And I'll. This is why I'm acting and none of that. Yeah you are the screenwriter alone your brother Jonathan wasn't working with you on this when he did it nice and yet there's. There has to be if there's two pages of dialogue in the home movie that's kind of amazing. Yeah there's that we're watching what's happening and coming up with what we think by watching not you. When it's it's shown on so. I'm a great fan of the silence the great sons owns for a lineman now picnic. I awards.

Whilst there's always McDonald and must go. It's really visuals secret thoughts of suspense that he knew how to do so well and I've tried this tool for this film.

A better understanding holes that would be gaining some understanding of the injury issues so by viewing it. From land from sea from the same events from different points of view. Stone to build up the big picture the movements of evacuation which are of course what is so amazing story. But hopefully never. Stepping counts on this intensely subjective. View and wonder what the whole film that's the reason it's a much shorter film usually films. The 106. Minutes yep if short freer it's pretty show yeah it was a 76 page script which is. You know well off or use. And it was you very much because we wanted to level of suspense and intense Steve condense things. We've never once the side of the cameras aways.

And then general recently that doesn't mind you know shot there will be subject he's keeping his hands on the and balancing the weight for them because of the two of them would submit. Don't surround this peculiar way and that would take away but not let us shoot the film. In the very. The subjective. New way that we wanted to and and spontaneous as well which for a filmmaker for directors it's a gift. To be able to be spontaneous with such an elegant and launch form but still be able to just. In bring the camera around just we've been fall is somebody. With the cameras but the other thing that's so that's basically didn't create this movie on your laptop.

And we created the journey from Cameron's and we did down on the some basic chemistry in the real place. And uses very very moving thing. And them. For the aerial so.

The 35th annual New Jersey Festival of Ballooning starts Friday at the Solberg Airport in Readington. That's about seven miles from Trump's Bedminster golf course.

Organizers had to plan for the possibility of flight restrictions and other security concerns from a potential presidential visit. Trump has a home on the golf course.

Trump is not scheduled to be there this weekend. There is a flight restriction in place from Aug. 3-20 that means planes can't land or takeoff from the airport.

The festival includes hundreds of balloons and musical performances by Pat Benatar, George Thorogood and Plain White T's."

He was overpowered and arrested.

The suspect is a 26-year-old who was born in the United Arab Emirates, police said, though they were still working to establish his nationality. Hamburg's mayor said that the man had apparently sought shelter in Germany and that authorities had been unable to deport him because he had no papers.

The assailant entered the supermarket in Hamburg's Barmbek district Friday afternoon and stabbed one man, who died at the scene. Police said the victim is believed to be a 50-year-old German.

After the assailant fled, he wounded a woman and four men with his knife before being overwhelmed by passers-by, police said. A fifth man was hurt while helping overpower the attacker, who was slightly injured, police said. Officers then arrested the assailant.

The wounded people, some of whom were seriously hurt, were taken to hospitals, authorities said.

Barmbek is in northeastern Hamburg, away from the downtown district.

Police said that they were ""investigating in every direction."" The news agency dpa quoted two witnesses at a nearby bakery as saying they heard the assailant shout ""Allahu akbar!"" as he held up the knife, but police did not confirm the report.

""Allahu akbar"" means ""God is great"" in Arabic and has been used by Islamic extremists when carrying out violent acts.

Mayor Olaf Scholz said the assailant was a foreigner who was supposed to leave Germany but couldn't be deported because he had no papers, dpa reported.

""It makes me all the more angry that the perpetrator is apparently someone who sought protection here in Germany and then turned his hatred against us,"" Scholz said.

In December, a Tunisian whose asylum application had been rejected drove a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 people."

Now, Robbie has received more than 4,000 rainbow pictures from as far away as Taiwan.

""It's very comforting knowing that so many people have reached out to him with the simple request of a rainbow,"" Crystal Skawinski told ABC News Thursday. ""It's like he has a whole world behind him now.""

Erica Toma

Skawinski, 37, a mom of two from Cohoes, New York, said that she gained custody of her her nephew, Robbie Ecuyer, 9, after her sister and brother-in-law died in May, just 22 days apart.

Shelly Ecuyer died from gastroparesis and cystic fibrosis on May 2, while Robbie's dad, Robert Ecuyer, died after a battle with addiction on May 24, Skawinski said. Soon after, Skawinski became Robbie's legal guardian.

Crystal Skawinski

""The first loss, my sister, was hard enough,"" Skawinski added. ""He lost his bedroom, his toys, his mom, his dad and everything that was consistent in his life. Robbie is autistic and the consistency in life is what [he is] used to, so all of that was taken away.

""[Gaining custody] helped pull me out of the depression from the death of my sister. There was no second-guessing. Robbie was mine now and that was that.""

Skawinski said that Robbie, who loves rainbows, was told that his mom went ""over the rainbow bridge"" when she had died. The day she passed, a double rainbow appeared over Robbie's school and a family member, Erica Toma, snapped a picture.

""I sent [the photo] to his father to help make a mental picture for Robbie,"" Toma told ABC News. ""As you see, one rainbow so strong and another quite vague -- another symbol for Robbie to understand mommy was waiting for daddy. Now we find double rainbows all over.""

Jessica Volk | Crystal Skawinski

The rainbow brought a lot of joy to Robbie, but when another one didn't show up one day, his aunt, Skawinski, decided to find other rainbows from around the world.

""When he didn't get a rainbow one day, I just went on Facebook and started asking for them,"" Skawinski said.

Aryonah Buffoni

On July 22, Skawinski began requesting rainbows using the hashtag #rainbowsforrobbie.

""It's raining so Robbie came out to check for rainbows,"" she wrote in the original post. ""Make sure you send me rainbow pics if you have them!!!!""

Ana-Alicia Hoover Alexander

Robbie received pictures of rainbows from places all over the world including Niagara Falls, Australia, Hawaii and Taiwan.

""[H]e'll know one day when he's a little bit older, that all this was for him,"" Skawinski said. ""The outpour has been amazing.""

Amy Sparks

Skawinski hopes to place all the rainbows in a slideshow with music for Robbie, she added.

Little did she know that she’d one day make history as one.

“There’s nothing like opening a magazine, or watching television, or looking at a billboard and being like wow you know what, she reminds me of me,” Huffine says on an episode of ABC Radio’s “No Limits with Rebecca Jarvis”.

The former pageant girl promptly took matters into her own hands at 15 years old, when she decided to take a trip from her Maryland hometown to visit modeling agencies in New York City. Huffine came face to face with rejection on her first day there, with some agencies asking her to consider losing 20 pounds.

“This really eye opening reality sort of hit me in that, I can’t be a model I suppose because my body was not those ideal measurements” Huffine tells Jarvis.

Reminiscing on her 15-year-old self, Huffine remembers feeling discouraged and ready to head home. Her mom had another idea, and instead encouraged her to stay in New York for just one more day. It was on that second day that Huffine landed a life-changing opportunity and was signed as a plus-size model.

Huffine was surprised to learn that this separation for plus-size models even existed, telling Jarvis, “I wasn’t afraid to tell friends that I had just gotten this contract as a plus-size model at this new agency. To me it meant no different.”

In 2011 she landed on the cover of Italian Vogue, and in 2015 became the first plus-size model to be featured in the revered Pirelli Calendar. Her childhood dreams had come true, but Huffine was also breaking barriers one picture at a time, redefining the terms of what it meant to be a high-fashion model.

A post shared by Candice Huffine (@candicehuffine) on Jun 5, 2017 at 3:19pm PDT

“We’re blurring the lines. That’s been the point for a very long time is blurring those lines, because it gets very confusing and I think frankly damaging,” Huffine says.

Huffine has now appeared on the pages of Harper’s Bazaar, W magazine, Vogue, Lane Bryant’s #ImNoAngel and “Plus is Equal” campaigns, and most recently the May cover of Elle Magazine.

But lately she’s being recognized for another endeavor: Project Start, an initiative she created with Women’s Running Magazine to encourage women to run.

For Huffine, running began as a dare from her husband but as soon as she started she realized that “there is so much that running brings to your life outside of just covering distance.” Huffine completed the New York City half marathon in 2016

“I really just wanted to encourage women to start their journey, or restart their journey and know that they absolutely can,” she added.

Another run, another moment to remind you to embrace and celebrate the person you are today. ?? #comeasyouare #PSYouGotThis Shirt by @wearewildfang A post shared by Candice Huffine (@candicehuffine) on Jul 26, 2017 at 5:53pm PDT

Today, Huffine has become a role model for young women everywhere. “Our world is made up of so many different kinds of women and it’s time that others get to see that so that they feel represented.”Hear Candice Huffine’s full interview on ABC Radio’s top business podcast, “No Limits With Rebecca Jarvis” available on iTunes Spotify and your ABC News app."
http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/baby-diagnosed-plagiocephaly-cool-back-future-themed-helmet/story?id=48892603,go,Baby diagnosed with plagiocephaly gets cool 'Back to the Future'-themed helmet,"['Abc News', 'More Joi-Marie']","When doctors recommended a 7-month-old boy be outfitted with a helmet, his mother had a novel idea to help avert stares and instead spark smiles.

Brendan Davis was diagnosed with plagiocephaly, or flat head syndrome, at four months old.

""Early on he had favored one side and he kept sleeping to that side and I noticed that it was flat,"" his mother Emily Davis told ABC News.

Eventually doctors suggested that the now 7-month-old be outfitted with a helmet to ""round his head out,"" Davis said. But, his doctors had a suggestion -- contact artist Paula Strawn of Lazardo Art.

Strawn told ABC News she's been painting helmets for conditions of all kinds for 14 years thanks to a suggestion from her daughters' teacher.

The stay-at-home mother now paints about seven helmets a week, charging an average of $200 to $300, depending on the design.

Emily Davis

Strawn, 60, said the act of designing a helmet often helps anxious parents.

""I've literally had moms sit on my couch and cry because they're so sad that her beautiful child has to wear this helmet,"" she recalled. ""The process of design helps people. They go from feeling bad to 'Oh, that's a fun idea!' It's like therapy.""

It certainly helped Emily Davis and her husband of nine years, Justin. They chose a ""Back to the Future"" theme for their son's helmet.

""We like 80s movies,"" she explained. ""We think it's a great movie. We recently introduced it to our 6-year-old son, Liam.""

Emily Davis

Brendan Davis' helmet not only has several references to the 1985 film, starring Michael J. Fox, but also has references to Mickey Mouse and Youngstown State University, where Emily Davis currently works. It's the same school from which her husband graduated.

Emily Davis said her son had no problem adapting to the helmet.

""When we put it on, he was at first like, 'What is this?' and then he went about this business,"" she said.

More importantly, her son isn't greeted with stares, he's greeted with positive feedback.

""Instead of people feeling sorry for him, they question why he has such a fun helmet on,"" Davis added.

After four weeks in his helmet, Davis said her son's condition has improved dramatically. He still has 10 weeks left to go in the helmet, but she knows he'll be OK thanks to the helmet with the design.

""It brings a bit of sunshine into our cloudy day,"" she said."

John Kelly, Trump's new chief of staff","['Abc News', 'Alana Abramson', 'More Elizabeth', 'More Alana']","President Donald Trump announced Friday via Twitter that he has selected retired Gen. John Kelly, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, to be his new chief of staff.

Kelly will replace Reince Priebus, who served as chief of staff for six months and was formerly the longest-serving Republican National Committee chairman.

I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary John F Kelly as White House Chief of Staff. He is a Great American.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2017

...and a Great Leader. John has also done a spectacular job at Homeland Security. He has been a true star of my Administration — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2017

I would like to thank Reince Priebus for his service and dedication to his country. We accomplished a lot together and I am proud of him! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2017

""I have been fortunate to have served my country for more than 45 years - first as a Marine and then as the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. I am honored to be asked to serve as the Chief of Staff to the President of the United States,"" Kelly said in a statement responding to the new position.

He also thanked those he worked with at the Department of Homeland Security. ""To the tremendous men and women of DHS, I thank you for the opportunity to serve as your Secretary. When I left the Marines, I never thought I would find as committed, as professional, as patriotic a group of individuals. I was wrong. You accomplish great things every day defending our nation and I know your exceptional work will continue,"" Kelly said.

Kelly, a retired Marine four-star general, was confirmed as the secretary of homeland security on Jan. 20. As secretary, he was a proponent of the president's travel ban and implemented new regulations for laptops on planes in passenger carry-ons -- a ban that was recently lifted.

He first met with Trump, then president-elect, on Nov. 20 at a Trump-owned golf course in New Jersey and was the second general selected for the Cabinet after retired Gen. James Mattis was chosen for defense secretary.

As secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, established in 2002 in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, Kelly dealt with issues like immigration, border security, domestic terrorism threats and cybersecurity.

Kelly traveled twice to Mexico as secretary of homeland security, most recently in July, where he met with President Enrique Peña Nieto and other senior-level officials. He also traveled to Jordan and Saudi Arabia to discuss security issues with his majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan and Saudi Crown Prince and Minister of the Interior Mohammed Bin Nayef Abd Al-Aziz Al Saud.

He met with other leaders from Canada, Costa Rica, Honduras and Haiti during his time as secretary.

Here’s what you need to know about Kelly:

Name: John Francis Kelly

Age: 67

Birthplace: Boston

What he used to do: He was the commander of U.S. Southern Command and a four-star general before he was confirmed as the secretary of homeland security. As head of SOUTHCOM, he was responsible for Guantanamo Bay and all U.S. military operations in South and Central America. At his retirement earlier this year, he was the armed forces’ longest-serving general.

Military career:

Kelly enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1970. His first military deployment was to Guantanamo Bay in 1971 when he was just 20 years old.

He graduated from the University of Massachusetts before returning to the Marine Corps and working his way up the ranks, with stints on aircraft carriers, in the nation's capital and at Camp Pendleton in California.

In 1999 he served as the special assistant to the supreme allied commander in Europe, one of NATO's two strategic commanders. By 2002, he was promoted to brigadier general and served — mostly in Iraq — with the 1st Marine Division as the assistant division commander.

After three years as a legislative assistant to the Marine Corps commandant in Washington, D.C., Kelly was promoted to major general and returned to Camp Pendleton to command I Marine Expeditionary Force. During his deployment in 2008 to Iraq's Anbar and western Nineveh provinces, he was a key military player in what became known as the Anbar Awakening, which temporarily reduced sectarian violence.

Kelly commanded Marine Forces Reserves and Marine Forces North before becoming the head of SOUTHCOM in 2011.

Things you might not know about him:

Kelly is a Gold Star father. His younger son, Marine 1st Lt. Robert Kelly, was killed by an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan in 2010.

He has spoken movingly about the loss of his son and about how little some Americans know about the sacrifice of service members.

“Those with less of a sense of service to the nation never understand it when men and women of character step forward to look danger and adversity straight in the eye, refusing to blink or give ground, even to their own deaths,” Kelly said in a Veterans Day speech in 2010.

“The protected can’t begin to understand the price paid so they and their families can sleep safe and free at night. No, they are not victims but are warriors, your warriors, and warriors are never victims, regardless of how and where they fall. Death or fear of death has no power over them. Their paths are paved by sacrifice, sacrifices they gladly make — for you.”

Where he stands on the issues:

Guantanamo Bay, Cuba

While Kelly was prepared to shut down the U.S. detention facility at the direction of President Barack Obama, he did not conceal his strong disagreement with the decision.

“They’re detainees, not prisoners,” Kelly told Military Times in January 2016. “The lifestyle they live in Guantanamo is — they can’t simply be put in prison in the United States.”

“Everyone has real, no-kidding intelligence on them that brought them there,” he added. “They were doing something negative, something bad, something violent, and they were taken from the battlefield. There are a lot of people that will dispute that, but I have dossiers on all of them, built and maintained by the intelligence community, both military and civilian. There are no innocent men down there.”

South and Central America

Kelly played a key role in negotiating the Alliance for Prosperity in late 2014.

The deal had the U.S. invest $1 billion in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to “stimulate economic growth, reduce inequality, promote educational opportunities, target criminal networks responsible for human trafficking and help create governance and institutions that are transparent and accountable,” according to the White House.

At Southern Command, he was vocal about the threat of “transnational organized crime” and warned that radicalized Muslims had left the Caribbean and South America to fight with ISIS in the Middle East.

Border security

Kelly is a proponent of stronger U.S. border enforcement but also believes that more can be done to reduce the number of people hoping to enter the U.S. without documentation, according to a published report.

“I think you have to have — we have a right to protect our borders, whether they’re seaward, coastlines or land borders,” Kelly told Military Times in January 2016.

“We have a right to do that. Every country has a right to do that. Obviously, some form of control, whether it’s a wall or a fence. But if the countries where these migrants come from have reasonable levels of violence and reasonable levels of economic opportunity, then the people won’t leave to come here,” he said.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection conducted an investigation following the incident at the San Ysidro port of entry in November 2013. Additionally, the San Diego Police Department conducted an in-custody death investigation. On January 24, 2014, the SDPD provided a copy of their investigation to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, which declined to file charges.

CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility continued to review the case spending nearly a year that included a national-level review board, which, in September 2014 also determined that no further action was warranted and the officers involved were not disciplined.

CBP Officers are our front line representatives protecting our country. In the San Diego Field Office alone, our officers encountered more than 75 million people last fiscal year. In spite of those vast numbers of daily interactions, our officers work hard to do the right thing every day, ensuring that they allow legitimate travelers into the U.S. while stopping illegal activity as well as working to ensure the well-being of the travelers that we are encounter.

With regard to the Guatemalan girls to which you refer, the case is actually still under investigation by CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility and I would tell you that CBP agents and officers are committed to treating everyone with professionalism, dignity and respect while enforcing the laws of the United States. CBP takes all allegations of mistreatment seriously, and does not tolerate actions that are not consistent with our core values of Vigilance, Service to Country and Integrity.

Travelers who feel that have been mistreated have a variety of options to report situations encountered while traveling via airports, train stations and U.S. Border crossings. Among those are the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP) and the CBP Info Center, where travelers can call to file a complaint so CBP can address the allegations and take any necessary actions. Travelers can also request to see a supervisor on-site to address any concerns. CBP is committed to following up on and addressing any allegations if the complainant’s information is shared.

All reports of misconduct are coordinated with the DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) for independent review and assessment. Some allegations are retained by the OIG for investigation while others are referred back to the Joint Intake Center for assignment to the appropriate office for investigation, fact-finding, or immediate management action. If misconduct is substantiated, appropriate corrective action will be initiated.

In August 2014, CBP initiated new reporting protocols to ensure all complainants who allege excessive force are interviewed prior to being processed for removal. All CBP components have been directed to immediately notify the Office of Professional Responsibility upon receipt of a complaint of alleged excessive force and to not remove individuals until OPR has had the opportunity to conduct an investigative interview of the complainant.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection is fully committed to earning the public trust through accountability and transparency within the law. To that end CBP has posted guidance on its website to allow the public to easily file a complaint or provide feedback at https://help.cbp.gov/app/home. The agency uses the feedback to improve its performance.

The CBP Information Center also has increased its Spanish-language capacity to provide improved service, accountability and transparency to those who speak Spanish via the fully-integrated Spanish-language service at https://helpspanish.cbp.gov/."

I have several framed versions in my office because they not only make me smile, they also ring with such truth, honesty and wisdom. Some people have a knack for putting into words what many of us cannot.

Babies are such an amazing gift, and becoming a parent, regardless of whether it’s for the first or sixth time, is one of the most rewarding and humbling experiences of one’s life. Although it isn’t quite possible to sum up the joy of a baby in several words, many of these baby quotes do a great job in summarizing some of the feelings and thoughts we have for our little ones.

I scoured the web for the best baby quotes out there and came up with the following top 10. Not only are many of them inspiring, they are also are great for greeting card ideas or baby’s scrapbook, or even table-toppers at a shower or first birthday party!

The Moment A Child Is Born The moment my children were born, I was changed forever. I grow daily as a mother thanks to them.

The mood was glum in the House GOP conference meeting Friday morning after the early-morning vote. Members munched on breakfast, continued to digest the setback in the Senate and reassessed their agenda, after GOP leaders began the meeting by playing Gordon Lightfoot's ""The Wreck of Edmund Fitzgerald.""

Leaders kicked off the meeting with the song -- about the sinking of a ship on Lake Superior in 1975 -- in light of the failed Senate health care vote.

""I thought at least they would get a bill to get us to get to conference. I was hoping for that,"" Rep. Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., told ABC News. ""I know Sen. [Mitch] McConnell worked hard. I’m a Kentuckian, he’s my home state senator, he really put a big effort into it. I know he was disappointed, and we’re disappointed, but hopefully we can move forward.""

Rep. Bruce Poliquin, R-Maine, in an effort to motivate his colleagues, showed clips of the Patriots' Super Bowl win last winter, according to a source in the room.

One member of leadership also told the often-fractious group of House Republicans they were now ""the most functional part of the U.S. government.""

Arch-conservative Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Alabama, interjected. ""That's a low bar! Low bar!""

While Brooks charged McConnell's with last night's failure, others lay the blame with the White House. Few commented on Arizona Sen. John McCain's deciding vote.

""This president never really laid out core principles and didn’t sell them to the American people,"" Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pennsylvania, told ABC News after the meeting.

President Donald Trump expressed frustration with the Senate Friday morning in a tweet, calling for a change to Senate rules to lower the threshold to pass major legislation. (The change wouldn't have helped with health care early this morning, which failed to attract 51 votes after defections from Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and McCain.)

If Republicans are going to pass great future legislation in the Senate, they must immediately go to a 51 vote majority, not senseless 60... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2017

...Even though parts of healthcare could pass at 51, some really good things need 60. So many great future bills & budgets need 60 votes.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2017

Speaking to law enforcement officials on Long Island Friday, Trump suggested letting Obamacare ""implode.""

""You can't have everything,"" he said of the vote.

In a statement Friday, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said he was ""disappointed and frustrated, but we should not give up.""

""I encourage the Senate to continue working toward a real solution that keeps our promise,"" he said.

Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., the leader of the influential House Freedom Caucus, told reporters he is continuing discussions with senators, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., on a way forward on health care that can attract broad GOP support in the Senate and House.

""Obviously, last night was a disappointment in the effort to repeal and replace. But it’s not a death knell,"" he said. ""I’m optimistic that we’ll have another motion to proceed and ultimately have something to put on the president’s desk.""

He said Republicans are waiting for the Congressional Budget Office to review several additional Senate proposals.

Moderate GOP Sen. Collins met earlier week with a group of senators, including Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., on a bipartisan approach to health care.

""On health care, I hope we can work together to make the system better in a bipartisan way,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said Friday, suggesting Congress take up renewing key payments to insurers to stabilize the insurance system.

""I think at the very beginning we should stabilize the system. We should make permanent the cost-sharing which keeps people's premiums down and keeps the counties that are covered up.""

Schumer, who said he spoke to Ryan about health care Friday, said relevant committee leaders have begun discussing the possibility of hearings on potential bipartisan health care reforms.

For House Republicans, the focus has also turned to tax reform. Earlier this week, Ryan, congressional leaders and the White House released a statement sketching out the broad contours of a reform deal. On the way out of conference today, Republicans were each handed small booklets. The title? ""31 Reasons for Tax Reform.""

Congress will also have to address must-pass items this fall. Lawmakers will have to raise the debt ceiling and approve government funding."

http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/kathy-griffin-longer-federal-investigation/story?id=48921352,go,Kathy Griffin: 'I am no longer under federal investigation',"['Abc News', 'More David']","After Kathy Griffin was photographed in May holding a fake bloodied, severed head of Donald Trump, a ferocious backlash ensued, and the comedian lost gigs and was subject to a Secret Service investigation.

But according to Griffin, she's now in the clear.

""I am no longer under federal investigation,"" she tweeted Friday. ""The case is closed, I have been completely exonerated. Finally.""

ABC News had contacted the Secret Service for comment.

At a press conference in early June, Griffin's attorney, Lisa Bloom said, ""The Secret Service has reached out to her ... a comedian ... she has has to retain a criminal attorney ... For the first time in history that we are aware of, the POTUS and his family is personally attempting to ruin a comedian ... Whether or not you get or like her artistic expression, Kathy Griffin has the right to publicly ridicule the president.""

When Griffin tweeted the photo initially, she wrote, ""I caption this 'there was blood coming out of his eyes, blood coming out of his ... wherever.'"" It was a reference to an exchange between the president and former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly during the presidential primary season.

But Griffin quickly apologized for the photo, taken by celebrity photographer Tyler Shields, tweeting a video, in which she said, ""Hey, everybody, it's me, Kathy Griffin. I sincerely apologize. I am just now seeing the reaction to these images. I'm a comic. I crossed the line. I move the line. Then I cross it. I went way too far. The image is too disturbing. I understand how it offends people. It wasn't funny.""

Despite the apology, the Secret Service was not amused. It issued a statement — which did not specifically cite the controversy — saying, ""The U.S. Secret Service has a critical mission. It is always unfortunate when people make statements that could be perceived as threats. We don't have the luxury of knowing a person's intent. Each alleged or perceived threat has to be investigated thoroughly, which taxes Secret Service manpower and resources that could be utilized elsewhere.""

On it! @SecretService has a robust protective intelligence division that monitors open source reporting & social media to evaluate threats — U.S. Secret Service (@SecretService) May 30, 2017"

The raids related to a bomb plot involving aircraft, Fairfax Media, News Corp. and the Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the counterterrorism raids on Saturday afternoon were ""designed to disrupt and prevent plans to undertake terrorist attacks in Australia.""

The operation was carried out by the Australian Federal Police, the New South Wales state police and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the country's domestic spy agency.

""Four men have been taken into custody and are assisting police with their enquiries,"" a police statement said.

Seven Network television reported that 40 riot squad officers stormed an inner-Sydney house before an explosives team found a suspicious device.

Turnbull said he was briefed on the progress of the operation by security agency heads.

""My number one priority, and that of my government, is the safety and security of all Australians, and the public should be reassured that our security and intelligence agencies are working tirelessly to keep us safe,"" the prime minister said in a statement.

Turnbull is expected to provide further details on Sunday."
http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/leading-disney-parks-imagineer-martin-sklar-dies-83-48900941,go,Leading Disney parks 'Imagineer' Martin Sklar dies at 83,['Abc News'],"Martin A. ""Marty"" Sklar, a right-hand man of Walt Disney and central figure in the development and expansion of his company's theme parks around the world, has died.

Disneyland spokeswoman Suzi Brown confirmed Sklar's death for The Associated Press. He died Thursday at his Hollywood Hills home at age 83, a company statement says. No details were released on his cause of death.

""Here you leave today and enter the world of yesterday, tomorrow and fantasy,"" Sklar said in 2005, reading from a plaque at the front of the park.

""That says so much about what Walt intended here,"" Sklar told the AP.

Sklar had roles in the development of every Disney park, from the original Disneyland in Southern California in 1955 to the Shanghai Disney Resort last year. He was revered by employees as a living link to the founder.

""Everything about Marty was legendary — his achievements, his spirit, his career,"" Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger said in a statement. ""He embodied the very best of Disney, from his bold originality to his joyful optimism and relentless drive for excellence. He was also a powerful connection to Walt himself.""

Sklar early on condensed Walt Disney's ideas into a widely circulated creed called ""Mickey's 10 Commandments,"" which many considered key to the parks' massive successes. He spelled them out in a 2015 book, ""One Little Spark!""

They included:

— Know your audience.

— Organize the flow of people and ideas.

— Avoid overload.

— For every ounce of treatment, provide a ton of fun.

Sklar was still a college student at UCLA when he was hired to create The Disneyland News for the original park and became a full-time Disney employee the following year.

For the next 54 years, he led the development and expansion of the company's parks. He was among the first to have the unique-to-Disney title of ""Imagineer"" when he became the company's chief creative leader for theme parks.

""Marty was one of Walt's most trusted advisers and helped turn his most ambitious dreams into reality,"" said Bob Weis, current president of Walt Disney Imagineering. ""For us, it's hard to imagine a world without Marty, because Marty is synonymous with Imagineering.""

Sklar scripted speeches for Walt Disney along with design and marketing materials for the parks and a film showing Disney's vision for Walt Disney World and Epcot in Florida before they were built.

He had a hand in the design of memorable Magic Kingdom attractions such as the ""The Enchanted Tiki Room,"" ''It's a Small World"" and ""Space Mountain.""

Like most Disney designers he had to face criticism from hardcore fans. He felt the need to respond to complaints when ""It's a Small World"" added characters from Disney films to its usual cast of international children.

""We are not trying to turn this classic attraction into a marketing pitch for Disney plush toys,"" Sklar said at the time. ""We are not 'young marketing whizzes' trying to make a name for ourselves.""

When the company made over Disneyland's Tomorrowland in 1998, he explained the company's constant intent to forge forward. ""The future is a moving target, and you have to keep aiming at it,"" he said.

Sklar retired in 2009. But he was still a frequent presence and ambassador at Disney events, including the company's D23 Expo earlier this month.

He is survived by his wife of 60 years Leah, and son Howard.

At Disneyland's 50th anniversary in 2005, he summed up his life's work as he walked into the park.

""I think Disneyland is so much about reassuring people the world can be OK, that things can be orderly, that you can speak to a stranger,"" he told The Associated Press. ""All those things that we are losing or have lost in our daily lives."""

Trump in a series of tweets Saturday morning slammed the rule requiring 60 votes on some measures, saying the Senate ""must get rid of 60 vote NOW!,"" contending that it allows a small number of Democrats to ""control country.""

Republican Senate must get rid of 60 vote NOW! It is killing the R Party, allows 8 Dems to control country. 200 Bills sit in Senate. A JOKE! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2017

The tweets today continue a theme that the president began early Friday and come after the Republican Senate leaders failed later on Friday to get even the 50 votes needed to push through a so-called ""skinny repeal"" of the Affordable Care Act known as Obamacare.

Republicans in the Senate will NEVER win if they don't go to a 51 vote majority NOW. They look like fools and are just wasting time...... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2017

....8 Dems totally control the U.S. Senate. Many great Republican bills will never pass, like Kate's Law and complete Healthcare. Get smart! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2017

If the Senate Democrats ever got the chance, they would switch to a 51 majority vote in first minute. They are laughing at R's. MAKE CHANGE! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2017

Trump also went after what he called ""the very outdated filibuster rule"" in the Senate.

The very outdated filibuster rule must go. Budget reconciliation is killing R's in Senate. Mitch M, go to 51 Votes NOW and WIN. IT'S TIME! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2017

GOP Senate leader Mitch McConnell has previously shown no inclination to change Senate rules.

McConnell was asked in a May 2 press conference about the president's call to change the rules to allow a simple majority in the Senate to pass bills that now require 60 votes.

""There is an overwhelming majority on a bipartisan basis not interested in changing the way the Senate operates ... and that will not happen,"" McConnell said at the time. ""It would fundamentally change the way the Senate has worked for a very long time. We're not going to do that."""

John Kelly as the new White House chief of staff, replacing Reince Priebus in the role.

""I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary John F Kelly as White House Chief of Staff. He is a Great American and a Great Leader. John has also done a spectacular job at Homeland Security. He has been a true star of my Administration,"" Trump said in a series of tweets Friday afternoon.

I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary John F Kelly as White House Chief of Staff. He is a Great American.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2017

...and a Great Leader. John has also done a spectacular job at Homeland Security. He has been a true star of my Administration — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2017

In a statement later on Friday, Priebus said it ""has been one of the greatest honors of my life to serve this President and our country.""

""I want to thank the President for giving me this very special opportunity,"" the statement continued. ""I will continue to serve as a strong supporter of the President's agenda and policies. I can't think of a better person than General John Kelly to succeed me and I wish him God's blessings and great success.""

Senior White House officials with direct knowledge of the changes happening in the West Wing said the president told Priebus two weeks ago he wanted to make a change.

Priebus spoke to CNN about two hours after the announcement was made, and he repeatedly said that he resigned but noted that the president wanted to go in a different direction.

“It was something I think the White House needs. I think it’s healthy, and I support him in it,” Priebus said of the shift.

Appearing on Fox News’ “Hannity” on Friday night, Priebus said he spoke with Trump about who would be his successor.

“We had a good talk yesterday. I resigned, he accepted it,” he said. “And we started working together and talking quite a few times about who would be a great pick to come in here and be the chief of staff, and I can't think of anyone better than a four-star general, John Kelly.”

Priebus added that he feels “hitting a reset button” is “a good thing.” He declined to comment on any controversy surrounding incoming White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci.

“It's just getting in the mud, and I think the palace intrigue stuff is annoying, and I think it's a distraction and it takes away from the president's agenda,” he said.

Kelly has already been working in the Trump administration, serving as the secretary of homeland security.

He released a statement thanking ""the tremendous men and women of DHS.""

""When I left the Marines, I never thought I would find as committed, as professional, as patriotic a group of individuals. I was wrong. You accomplish great things everyday defending our nation and I know your exceptional work will continue,"" Kelly said.

Kelly added that he is ""honored to be asked to serve"" as the president's chief of staff.

Kelly will start as chief of staff on Monday morning and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said that a Cabinet meeting will follow his swearing-in.

Trump praised Kelly just this afternoon at an event with law enforcement officials on Long Island in New York.

Trump said Kelly ""has done an incredible job of secretary of homeland security. Incredible. One of our real stars. Truly one of our stars. John Kelly is one of our great stars.""

Trump thanked him for ""his service"" in a tweet.

I would like to thank Reince Priebus for his service and dedication to his country. We accomplished a lot together and I am proud of him! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2017

After walking off Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, Trump briefly spoke to reporters.

""Reince is a good man. John Kelly will do a fantastic job. General Kelly has been a star. Done an incredible job thus far. Respected by everybody. A great, great American. Respected by everybody. Reince Priebus [is] a good man,"" Trump said.

Trump has felt his team needed a chief of staff who could help push his agenda forward and get the West Wing in shape. After that conversation, the president began weighing his options and ultimately decided on his first choice – Kelly – the officials told ABC News.

The president’s plan was to make this change around the congressional recess with the goal of having a vacation period to get things in shape heading into the fall, the officials said, noting that the fact that new communications director Anthony Scaramucci has joined the team is not connected to Priebus leaving.

As one source put it, “This was a long time coming, period.”

In spite of the officials' comments, the personnel shift comes amid growing acrimony inside the White House, which was made public most clearly when Scaramucci called a reporter for The New Yorker and gave a series of expletive-ridden criticisms of Priebus, among others.

""Reince Priebus — if you want to leak something — he’ll be asked to resign very shortly,"" Scaramucci told reporter Ryan Lizza, according to The New Yorker article.

""Reince is a f------ paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac,"" Scaramucci said, the article states.

The day before The New Yorker article was published, Scaramucci posted a tweet, which he later deleted, where he tagged Priebus and wrote that he would be contacting the FBI and Department of Justice to investigate leaking.

Priebus was one of the members of Trump's senior staff who had the most experience working in Washington politics, having previously served as the Republican National Committee chairman before joining the Trump team during the transition.

He had ties to key members of the Republican Party, like House Speaker and fellow Wisconsinite Paul Ryan, but his support base within the White House is believed to have eroded in recent weeks. Katie Walsh, who served as Priebus' deputy chief of staff at the White House, left in March, and on July 21, press secretary Sean Spicer resigned. Both Walsh and Spicer worked with Priebus at the RNC."

http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/video-officer-told-venus-williams-caused-fatal-crash-48907459,go,Video: Officer told Venus Williams she caused fatal crash,['Abc News'],"A police officer told tennis star Venus Williams she likely caused a crash that fatally injured an elderly man last month but didn't cite her, saying it appeared the actions of a third driver left her in a bad spot, a newly released body camera video shows.

The Palm Beach Gardens police video shows Williams walking uninjured and speaking calmly to officers minutes after the June 9 crash. The video also shows the other vehicle's passenger, 78-year-old retired teacher Jerome Barson, was conscious, but bleeding and confused. It was later determined he had a broken spine and internal injuries. He died June 22. His wife, driver Linda Barson, told officers she had a broken arm.

Security video released earlier showed Williams was driving straight on a green light as she exited her neighborhood but a car turning left cut her off, forcing her to stop midway as she crossed a busy six-lane intersection. When she restarted, her light had turned red and the Barsons' light had turned green. Their Hyundai sedan plowed into Williams' Toyota Sequoia SUV.

The body camera video released late Thursday shows Williams, 37, listening intently as she sat in her SUV as Officer David Dowling, the lead investigator, explained to her why he believed after interviewing her and witnesses that she was at fault but wasn't going to give her a ticket.

""You had a green light, so you had the right of way when you started to exit but because you got stuck in the middle of the intersection, you lost that right of way,"" Dowling told Williams, who was dressed in a white tennis shirt and skirt and blue baseball cap. Linda Barson, he said, now had a green light ""and had no way of knowing that you were going to come across.""

Williams asked Dowling, ""In a situation like that, what do you do? Because you can't back up.""

""Exactly,"" Dowling replies. ""You just got stuck in a bad situation there. I would just let the insurance companies work it out. I am not giving you a citation.""

Palm Beach Gardens police now say the investigation remains open and no fault has been assigned.

After the crash, Williams competed at Wimbledon, losing in the finals on July 15 to Garbine Muguruza. Williams, who has won Wimbledon five times, broke down in tears when asked at a tournament press conference about the crash and Jerome Barson's death.

Barson's estate filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Williams on June 30, seeking unspecified damages.

""The body camera footage clearly supports our original assessment that Venus is at fault for this accident,"" the estate's attorney, Michael Steinger, said in a statement Friday. ?

Williams' attorney, Malcolm Cunningham, declined comment through his spokeswoman."
http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/rios-olympics-year-good-bad-ugly-48901942,go,"Rio's Olympics 1 year later: The good, the bad and the ugly",['Abc News'],"Neymar kissed the ball, delivered a gold medal and then wept with other Brazilians.

Look no further if you're searching for an iconic image of the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.

""It's the only medal that really mattered,"" Salvador Gaeta said recently while cycling in the deserted Olympic Park. ""Every Brazilian will remember it.""

Other memories have faded at home since the Olympics opened a year ago. A few expectations were met, but many fell short of those promised by IOC President Thomas Bach and organizing committee head Carlos Nuzman.

Bach boasted at the closing ceremony of ""a Rio de Janeiro before, and a much better Rio de Janeiro after the Olympic Games.""

Nuzman called Rio the next Barcelona, one of the cities clearly transformed by the games.

Save for minor cosmetic changes, a city fractured by mountains and searing inequality remains as it was. Violent crime mostly concealed during the Olympics is soaring, tied to Brazil's deepest economic downturn in 100 years and unpaid policemen leaving in droves. Brazil's military has been called in to quell Rio's untethered violence.

Rio barely managed to keep it together for the Olympics, needed a government bailout to hold the Paralympics and then collapsed under a grinding recession and sprawling corruption scandals.

The games took place mostly in the south and west of the city, which remains white and wealthy. The rest is still a hodgepodge of dilapidated factories and hillside slums of cinderblocks, tin roofs and open troughs of raw sewage.

Brazil says it spent $13 billion in public and private money to organize the Olympics — some estimates suggest $20 billion — and many games-related projects since then have been tied to corruption scandals that marred the games and drove up costs. Federal police and prosecutors have linked overpriced projects to graft between politicians and construction companies.

A look at the fallout since the Olympics opened on Aug. 5:

———

THE GOOD

The Olympics left behind a new subway line extension, high-speed bus service and an urban jewel: a renovated port area filled with food stands, musicians and safe street life in a city rife with crime.

These probably would not have been built without the prestige of the Olympics. But the games also imposed deadlines and drove up the price. A state auditor's report said the 9.7 billion real ($3 billion) subway was overbilled by 25 percent.

Igor Silverio lives nearby the port in a favela — or shanytown — and came the other day to kick around a soccer ball with his two young boys. The area in his youth was known for decay and drunkenness.

""For sure it's better,"" he said. But, he added, he ""expected more from the Olympics.""

""From my point of view, the Olympics only benefited the foreigners. Local people themselves didn't get much. The security situation isn't good, the hospitals. I think these are investments that didn't benefit many local people.""

He said he skipped the Olympics because they were ""too expensive"" and located far away in the suburbs.

Standing outside the new subway line, 57-year-old domestic worker Isa Trajano Fernandes said public transportation had improved but was still deficient.

""When the Olympics were going on it was better, but then they let it slide,"" she said.

She complained about crowding on the new express buses and the lack of security.

""People have no dignity using public transportation in Rio de Janeiro,"" she said.

———

THE BAD

The Olympics left a half-dozen vacant sports arenas in the Olympic Park and 3,600 empty apartments in the boarded-up Olympic Village. Deodoro, a major complex of venues in the impoverished north, is shuttered behind iron gates.

Standing across the street, Jose Mauricio Pehna de Souza was asked if Rio benefited from the Olympics.

""I don't think so, not us in Brazil,"" he said.

A $20 million golf course is struggling to find players and financing.

A few dozen were on the course on a recent, sunny Saturday. The clubhouse is mostly unfurnished, and it costs non-Brazilians 560 reals ($180) for 18 holes and a cart.

Organizers and the International Olympic Committee say Rio needs time to develop these venues, and faults Brazil's deep recession for most of the problems.

A prosecutor several months ago disputed this, saying the Olympic Park ""lacked planning how to use white elephant"" sports venues. Many were built as part of real estate deals that have yet to pan out.

Juliana Solaira, a 30-year-old pharmacist who lives across from the park, called the space ""an excellent legacy"" but said ""few people use it.""

""Here we see all this money spent,"" she said. ""Unfortunately, we see most of the arenas are closed. So I think it could have been used in a better way.""

The park offers few amenities: no restaurants, no shade and nothing much to do except gawk at deserted arenas. City hall officials and the federal government say they're planning an event for Aug. 5 to ""fill all the arenas"" for the day.

———

THE UGLY

Rio organizers promised to clean up polluted Guanabara Bay in their winning bid in 2009. During the Olympics, officials used stop-gap measures to keep floating sofas, logs and dead animals from crashing into boats during the sailing events.

Since the Olympics, the bankrupt state of Rio de Janeiro has ceased major efforts to clean the bay, its unwelcome stench often drifting along the highway from the international airport.

""I think it's gotten worse,"" Brazil's gold-medal sailor Kahena Kunze said in a recent interview. ""There was always floating trash, but I see more and more. It's no use hiding the trash because it comes back. I figured it would get worse because I haven't seen anything concrete being done.""

Avenida Brasil, the main north-south artery through the city, is a snarl of unfinished roads and express bus lanes, viaducts to nowhere and detours through miles (kilometers) of traffic cones.

Some of the politicians behind the Olympics have been accused of graft, and organizers still owe creditors about $30 million to 40 million.

Former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who wept when Rio was awarded the games, was convicted last month on corruption charges and faces a 9 1/2-year prison term. He is appealing.

Former Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes , the local moving force behind the Olympics, is being investigated for allegedly accepting at least 15 million reals ($5 million) in payments to facilitate construction projects tied to the games. He denies wrongdoing.

Another early booster, former Rio state governor Sergio Cabral, is in jail on corruption charges.

Carlos Nuzman, president of the organizing committee, was defeated earlier this year in an election to lead the Pan American Sports Organization. He ran on his record leading the Rio Olympics and finished third in a three-man race.

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/inside-feud-reince-priebus-anthony-scaramucci/story?id=48906416,go,Inside the feud between Reince Priebus and Anthony Scaramucci,"['Abc News', 'More Meghan']","The simmering tensions between different factions within the White House reached a very public boil in recent days.

The foul-mouthed exchange that communications director Anthony Scaramucci had with a reporter for The New Yorker put the acrimony on full display, giving the public a clear view into the personnel turbulence.

Scaramucci took aim at both Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, but the criticisms of Priebus struck a stronger chord because they came after Scaramucci posted a cryptic tweet Wednesday that he later deleted, which many took as him calling for Priebus to be investigated as a leaker.

Those accusations capped their first week working alongside each other at the White House, and mark a contrast from the strong relationship that they were touting when Scaramucci was first brought on.

Starting off with a somewhat unified front

On July 21, shortly after it was confirmed that Scaramucci had been hired as communications director, reports surfaced that Priebus had not known about the hiring before it happened, which would be highly unusual -- and telling -- given his position as chief-of-staff.

Hours later, Sean Spicer resigned as press secretary, marking one of the most public departures from the administration during its six-month tenure.

Spicer, who worked with Priebus for years at the Republican National Committee before joining the Trump administration, had been giving fewer press briefings in recent weeks but had been serving as the highest-ranking individual in the communications department.

Shortly after Spicer's resignation, amid swirling questions about how Scaramucci's hiring factored into his decision, Priebus told ABC News' Chief White House Correspondent Jon Karl that he fully supports Scaramucci and has a longstanding good relationship with him.

Priebus noted that Scaramucci had even offered him the role of chief operating officer in his finance venture back in 2012. Scaramucci cited the same tidbit as evidence of their existing ties when he gave his first press conference later that day.

""I think it reflects poorly on Reince that he didn't take my offer to come in and be our chief operating officer, but I say that in jest obviously,"" Scaramucci said at the briefing.

""What I want you guys to know is that he was my first call this morning. I met with him before we sat in the Oval Office, and we are committed as true professionals to the team and the process of getting the administration’s message out,"" he said.

""There’s been some speculation in the press about me and Reince so I just want to talk about that very quickly. Reince and I have been personal friends for six years. We are a little bit like brothers where we rough each other up once in a while, which is totally normal for brothers,"" he said.

Alex Brandon/AP

Change in tone

The relationship appeared to take a paranoid turn as the days progressed, however, with the next bump coming on Wednesday, July 26.

It was later revealed that Scaramucci called Ryan Lizza, a reporter for The New Yorker, that evening after Lizza tweeted that a senior White House official told him that Trump and the first lady were having dinner with former Fox News executive Bill Shine and Fox News host Sean Hannity.

Scaramucci called Lizza to try to determine who told him about that dinner, according to the article that Lizza published the following day. Scaramucci ended the call saying “I’ve gotta start tweeting some s--- to make this guy crazy,” according to The New Yorker article. Shortly after, he tweeted that his financial disclosure information had been illegally leaked and he was calling on the FBI and Department of Justice to investigate, ending the tweet by tagging Priebus.

Lizza then posted a tweet, writing, “In case there's any ambiguity in his tweet I can confirm that Scaramucci wants the FBI to investigate Reince for leaking.”

Scaramucci subsequently deleted that original tweet and wrote another one that featured a screengrab of a news story with the headline, “Scaramucci appears to want Priebus investigated by FBI.”

“Wrong! Tweet was public notice to leakers that all Sr Adm officials are helping to end illegal leaks. @Reince45,” Scaramucci’s tweet read.

Wrong! Tweet was public notice to leakers that all Sr Adm officials are helping to end illegal leaks. @Reince45 pic.twitter.com/AB0reseuX1 — Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) July 27, 2017

On Thursday morning, he called into CNN, saying that he and Trump have a ""very good idea"" of the ""senior leakers are in the White House.""

""As you know from the Italian expression, the fish stinks from the head down. But I can tell you two fish that don't stink. That's me and the president,"" Scaramucci said on CNN.

He then directly referenced Priebus and said, ""We have had odds, we have had differences.""

""When I said we were brothers from the podium, that's because we're rough on each other -- some brothers are like Cain and Abel,"" he said, referencing a biblical passage that ends in Cain killing Abel. ""Other brothers can fight with each other and then get along. I don't know if this is repairable or not. That will be up to the president.""

Foul-mouthed call

The last blow of the day came when Lizza published an article on The New Yorker's website detailing his alleged conversation with Scaramucci the night before.

At one point during the call, Scaramucci called Priebus a “f------ paranoid schizophrenic.”

At another, Scaramucci used a vulgar phrase describing how he alleges Priebus prevented him from becoming a part of the administration in the first six months.

Scaramucci turned to Twitter to comment on the story, but he did not deny any of the article nor did he apologize for the comments that he made -- only saying he would refrain from using such ""colorful language.""

“I sometimes use colorful language. I will refrain in this arena but not give up the passionate fight for @realDonaldTrump's agenda. #MAGA,” Scaramucci said in a tweet this evening after the article posted.

He later appeared to blame Lizza for publishing the exchange, ""I made a mistake in trusting in a reporter. It won't happen again.""

Both Priebus and Scaramucci were reportedly traveling with the president on Air Force One today to New York."

John McCain, R-Ariz., during the razor-thin “skinny” repeal vote, with eagle-eyed CSPAN watchers reading the tea leaves of his motions across the Senate floor.

But he wasn’t the only star of the show.

Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, had adamantly opposed the bill repeatedly during the past month of debate on the issue.

And their ""no"" votes came before McCain's now-famous thumbs-down motion, officially sinking the bill.

It would be hard for the trio's home states to be farther apart, but they came together on the vote in a devastating way for the Republican Party at large in the wee hours of Friday morning.

Collins and Murkowski have been outspoken in their opposition to the Medicaid cuts, and Collins has come to the defense of Planned Parenthood as well.

In her statement following the vote, Collins stressed the importance of a bipartisan approach for a solution, writing that “rather than engaging in partisan exercises, Republicans and Democrats should work together and address these vert serious problems.”

And Murkowski posted a tweet, saying, “This isn’t about winning. This is about service to our state and service to our country.”

""This isnt about winning. This is about service to our state and service to our country."" - Lisa from #Alaska — Lisa Murkowski (@LisaForSenate) November 9, 2016

McCain had not been as vocal about his opposition in the weeks leading up to the vote, having been away from Washington, D.C., for part of the debate. He underwent surgery to remove a blood clot near his eye on July 14 and doctors subsequently discovered a brain tumor, which was announced on July 19.

He returned to Washington on July 25 to cast the decision-making vote in a procedural motion that allowed Thursday night's debate on health care to continue.

In a statement released following his vote early this morning, McCain said that ""from the beginning"" he has believed that Obamacare should be repealed and replaced in order to lower costs, improve care and increase competition, he said ""the so-called 'skinny repeal' amendment the Senate voted on today would not accomplish those goals.”

While there was a round of applause -- largely from the Democrats in the Senate -- after McCain made that fatal vote early this morning, all three GOP senators have earned the ire of President Donald Trump.

This morning, he looped the three with the Democrats on Twitter, writing ""3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!"""

The truth is that it does, and they know that it does. To the extent that these are predictable affairs, it’s reasonable to expect a feistier debate, not so much about Trump as it is about who will stand up to Trump.

But another intriguing storyline with be the candidate who plays for the sidebar. Several aides to rival campaigns have cited Ben Carson’s surprise breakout in the last debate as a template – and evidence that you can “win” even a debate in this environment without just mixing it up with Trump.

One aide to a campaign with this longer-game strategy laughed when I asked about campaign strategy, pointing out that these are dynamic and hard-to-game-plan events: “Everyone watches too many ‘West Wing’ reruns!”







BEHIND THE SCENES: Governor Walker hanging out at the Reagan Ranch prepping for tonight's #GOPdebate. #Walker16 #cnndebate by Scott Walker via Instagram

RAND PAUL: ""WE'RE ALL IN AND READY FOR COMBAT""

ABC’s JESSICA HOPPER and JOSH HASKELL: Sen. Rand Paul arrived at a shooting range in Simi Valley this morning. Wearing blue jeans and Ray Ban sunglasses, Paul shot two rifles and a pistol. Paul elected to shoot a rifle first because he said his neck was bothering him. He also asked for ear muffs towards the end. After examining his target, some of which were labeled ""IRS Tax Code,"" Paul talked to reporters. He laughed when asked if shooting was helping him relax ahead of the debate. He said he has only shot around 10 times in his life but enjoys it.

Favorite He used the word ‘combat’ several times to describe tonight's GOP debate and discussed his plan to take down GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, saying that ultimately people would get past Trump's celebrity and that it is important to expose Trump for who he is.

“He's recently come to join the Republican Party and he's trying to come to join as a conservative but I think there's a great deal of evidence pointing in the opposite direction that he's really not a conservative and so I think we will have that debate,” said Paul, who has repeatedly called Trump a fake conservative. Paul went on to argue, ""Ultimately the issues will be a problem for Trump when people get beyond the celebrity. I do think that his attack on Fiorina probably started to wake people up. I think Governor Perry leaving the race started to wake people up that my goodness, a governor of a large Republican state is leaving, but we're keeping a reality TV Star who really shows no evidence of really being serious about anything."" The Kentucky Senator was asked about Gov. Chris Christie, who he fought with during the first Republican debate. ""We're all in and I'm ready for combat,” Paul answered.

HOW HILLARY CLINTON’S CAMPAIGN IS SPENDING DEBATE NIGHT ABC’s LIZ KREUTZ reports: Meanwhile, what’s Hillary Clinton's campaign up to tonight?

Hosting house parties!

The Clinton campaign has organized over 100 “Women for Hillary” GOP debate-night watch parties in roughly 20 cities across the country for women supporters a and volunteers to watch the debate. According to the campaign, “while the Republican candidates bend over backwards to offer extreme, out-of-touch and out-of-date positions, women supporters will discuss Hillary’s record as a champion of women and girls.” In addition, the campaign has launched a Pinterest page — “Organizing 101: House Parties for Hillary” — with instructions on how you (aka “everyday Americans”) can host one, too. Here are some of the cities hosting a ""Hillary for America"" GOP Debate Watch Party tonight: Boca Raton, FL Austin, TX Charleston, SC Minneapolis, MN Washington, D.C. Chicago, IL Denver, CO Kansas City, MO Biloxi, MS Memphis, TN Vienna, WV Columbia, SC Chantilly, VA Detroit, MI Lubbock, TX Portland, OR Tuscaloosa, AL Myrtle Beach, SC Bailey, CO





SCOTT WALKER’S DEBATE DAY DISCOUNT

ABC’s MEREDITH MCGRAW: Is Scott Walker’s campaign holding a going out of business sale?





That’s what Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Holly Shulman asked on Twitter today after the Walker campaign advertised 40 percent off all merchandise in its online store for one day only.

Among the items for sale: Red, white and blue bumper stickers (two for $10), limited edition signed rally placards ($75), and “Walker for President” embroidered fleece pullovers that retail for $65.00. As the website notes, “All proceeds are invested in our campaign to elect Scott Walker for President in 2016.” Walker had been riding high in the polls both nationally and in Iowa, but as Donald Trump took more of the spotlight this summer, Walker’s support has crumpled. Recent national polls put him in the low single digits. Tonight, Walker takes the stage at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in an effort to win back some of that early support. But Walker, who is viewed as the Midwestern foil to Trump’s gilded, showy style, isn’t closing shop yet. Despite canceling campaign events in Michigan and California next week, he will continue to campaign throughout Iowa and South Carolina. And Walker’s campaign isn’t the only trying to move some merchandise in honor of tonight’s debate. Ted Cruz is offering his supporters 20 percent off items in his campaign store like camo print hats. Scott Walker @ScottWalker What's better than a #Walker16 T-Shirt? How about a #Walker16 T-Shirt that's 40% off. BUY --> sw.gop/7h http://pbs. twimg. com/media/CPCGjRLVAAAJoWR. png

HOW JEB BUSH IS PREPPING FOR TONIGHT’S DEBATE"
http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/willa-ford-explains-left-music-industry/story?id=48906177,go,Willa Ford explains why she left the music industry,"['Abc News', 'More Michael']","In a recent interview with Billboard magazine, singer and designer Willa Ford revealed why she left the music industry in the early 2000s.

""A lot of people don’t realize this, but my second single was released on Sept. 11, 2001,” Ford told Billboard. “Everything that happened that day froze; the world stood still, as it should have. My second single didn’t do well because anything that launched that day kind of got canned. I know that sounds silly, but on radio they slate things, but it really fell to the wayside. I didn’t think it was a big deal because we were making a new album anyway. The record company I was with at the time got acquired by another record company, and the president of our record company left the company. So, I ended up in no man’s land.""

Now the singer, whose hit ""I Wanna Be Bad"" was a mainstay on MTV in the early 2000s, is attempting to walk back her comments.

""In a recent interview ... I stated ‘Everything that happened that day froze; the world stood still as it should have,’"" she told People magazine in a statement Thursday. ""During the past day, other news outlets have taken the liberty to say that I somehow blamed 9/11 for my song not taking off … this could not be further from the truth.”

Ford said that the quote -- which also included her leaving the pop scene because of her classical music background, her sister having a baby and more -- was ""meant to be an inspirational piece about how the universe sent me in a new and different direction, one that has led me to success and joy in other areas of my personal and professional life.""

Ford is now an interior designer and businesswoman with her company, W Ford Interiors."

Senior White House officials with direct knowledge of the changes happening in the West Wing say that President Donald Trump and Priebus spoke two weeks ago, and Trump reportedly said that he wanted to make a change.

Here is a rundown of how the past two days played out.

Wednesday, July 26

Sometime that evening

Scaramucci called Ryan Lizza, a reporter for The New Yorker, Wednesday evening, after Lizza had tweeted that a senior White House official told him that Trump and the first lady were having dinner with former Fox News executive Bill Shine and Fox News host Sean Hannity.

Scaramucci called Lizza to try to determine who told him about that dinner, according to the article that Lizza published the following day in The New Yorker. Scaramucci ended the call saying “I’ve gotta start tweeting some s--- to make this guy crazy,” according to The New Yorker article.

Shortly after, Scaramucci tweeted that his personal financial disclosure information had been illegally leaked, and that he was calling on the FBI and Department of Justice to investigate. He ending the tweet by tagging Priebus.

Lizza then posted a tweet, writing, “In case there's any ambiguity in his tweet I can confirm that Scaramucci wants the FBI to investigate Reince for leaking.”

Scaramucci subsequently deleted that original tweet.

Thursday July 27

12:47 a.m.

Scaramucci then wrote another tweet, which featured a screengrab of a news story with the headline, “Scaramucci appears to want Priebus investigated by FBI.”

“Wrong! Tweet was public notice to leakers that all Sr Adm officials are helping to end illegal leaks. @Reince45,” Scaramucci’s tweet read.

Wrong! Tweet was public notice to leakers that all Sr Adm officials are helping to end illegal leaks. @Reince45 pic.twitter.com/AB0reseuX1 — Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) July 27, 2017

around 7:20 a.m.

The following morning, Scaramucci called into CNN, saying that he and Trump have a ""very good idea"" about who the ""senior leakers are in the White House.""

""As you know from the Italian expression, the fish stinks from the head down. But I can tell you two fish that don't stink. That's me and the president,"" Scaramucci said on CNN.

He then directly referenced Priebus and said, ""We have had odds, we have had differences.""

""When I said we were brothers from the podium, that's because we're rough on each other -- some brothers are like Cain and Abel,"" he said, referencing a biblical passage that ends in Cain killing Abel. ""Other brothers can fight with each other and then get along. I don't know if this is repairable or not. That will be up to the president.""

Around 5:00 p.m.

The last blow of the day came when Lizza published an article on The New Yorker's website detailing his account of his conversation with Scaramucci the night before.

At one point during the call, Scaramucci called Priebus a “f------ paranoid schizophrenic,” according to the article.

At another point, Scaramucci used a vulgar phrase describing how he alleges Priebus prevented him from becoming a part of the administration in the first six months.

6:23 p.m.

Scaramucci turned to Twitter to comment on The New Yorker story, but he did not deny any of the article nor did he apologize for the comments that he made -- only saying he would refrain from using such ""colorful language.""

“I sometimes use colorful language. I will refrain in this arena but not give up the passionate fight for @realDonaldTrump's agenda. #MAGA,” Scaramucci said in a tweet this evening after the article posted.

I sometimes use colorful language. I will refrain in this arena but not give up the passionate fight for @realDonaldTrump's agenda. #MAGA — Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) July 27, 2017

At 8:50 p.m. Scaramucci later appeared to blame Lizza for publishing the exchange, ""I made a mistake in trusting in a reporter. It won't happen again.""

I made a mistake in trusting in a reporter. It won't happen again. — Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) July 28, 2017

Friday July 28

12:24 p.m.

Both Priebus and Scaramucci were travelling with the president on Air Force One to Long Island in New York.

2:13 p.m.

During the speech to law enforcement officers, Trump made a point to give a shout out to his then-secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Ret. Gen. John Kelly.

Trump said Kelly ""has done an incredible job of secretary of homeland security. Incredible. One of our real stars. Truly one of our stars. John Kelly is one of our great stars.""

4:42 p.m.

Air Force One arrives at Joint Base Andrews.

4:49 p.m. through 4:54 p.m.

Trump tweeted that Kelly is the new chief of staff.

""I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary John F Kelly as White House Chief of Staff. He is a Great American and a Great Leader. John has also done a spectacular job at Homeland Security. He has been a true star of my Administration,"" Trump said in a series of tweets Friday afternoon.

I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary John F Kelly as White House Chief of Staff. He is a Great American.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2017

...and a Great Leader. John has also done a spectacular job at Homeland Security. He has been a true star of my Administration — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2017

5:00 p.m.

Trump mentions Priebus in the third tweet.

“I would like to thank Reince Priebus for his service and dedication to his country. We accomplished a lot together and I am proud of him!” the tweet reads.

I would like to thank Reince Priebus for his service and dedication to his country. We accomplished a lot together and I am proud of him! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2017

Shortly after 5:00 p.m.

Trump walked off the plane by himself. Priebus was seen exiting after and into an awaiting car. Scaramucci reportedly stayed in New York and did not make the return trip on Air Force One.

Around 6:20 p.m.

Priebus issued a statement confirming his departure.

""It has been one of the greatest honors of my life to serve this President and our country. I want to thank the President for giving me this very special opportunity. I will continue to serve as a strong supporter of the president's agenda and policies. I can't think of a better person than General John Kelly to succeed me and I wish him God's blessings and great success,"" Priebus said."
http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/watchdog-group-seeks-probe-epa-chief-pruitts-travel-48908977,go,Watchdog group seeks probe into EPA chief Pruitt's travel,['Abc News'],"An ethics watchdog group filed a complaint asking for an investigation into Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt's frequent flights to his home state of Oklahoma at taxpayer expense.

The group American Oversight sent a letter Thursday to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel asking for an investigation into whether Pruitt violated federal rules by using government resources to travel to Oklahoma for ""personal or political reasons.""

""The Trump administration is seeking to cut EPA's budget by 31%, putting Americans' health and safety at risk,"" American Oversight Executive Director Austin Evers, who was a lawyer for the State Department under President Barack Obama, said in a written statement. ""At the same time, Pruitt is spending scarce taxpayer dollars to fuel his personal ambition for higher office.""

Pruitt's expense reports from March, April and May were released following a Freedom of Information request filed by Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit watchdog group. The records show Pruitt traveled home at least 10 times, typically leaving Washington on Fridays and returning on Mondays. Pruitt was either in Oklahoma or on trips that included stops there for nearly half of the days encompassed in the three-month period, costing more than $15,000.

Pruitt was in Oklahoma again on Thursday visiting with the editorial board of The Oklahoman newspaper and with a group of ranchers in the Oklahoma Panhandle. Oklahoma City television station KOKH reported that Pruitt said the criticism of his travel was an unfair attack by his opponents.

""The folks talking about this, one, their facts are wrong and that's not a surprise, but it's an alt-EPA,"" Pruitt said.

A Pruitt spokeswoman told the TV station the environmental watchdog group inaccurately calculated his travel days on Friday and Monday as days missed from work."
http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/defense-lawyer-shkreli-lose-65-million-convicted-48906683,go,"Shkreli portrayed as con, prodigy at securities fraud trial",['Abc News'],"Former pharmaceutical CEO Martin Shkreli was portrayed both as a swindler by the government and as a well-meaning prodigy by his lawyers on the second day of closing arguments Friday at his securities fraud trial.

The trial in federal court in Brooklyn ""has exposed Martin Shkreli for who he really is — a con man who stole millions,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacquelyn Kasulis told jurors.

Prosecutors allege that the 34-year-old Shkreli looted his drug company, Retrophin, of stock and cash so he could pay back disgruntled investors in a pair of failed hedge funds he ran. Investors testified that the defendant repeatedly lied to them about what was going on with their money.

The defense has argued that no one was victimized because Shkreli used his ""genius"" to make Retrophin a success and ensure investors doubled or even tripled their money.

""Who lost anything? Nobody,"" defense attorney Ben Brafman said in his closing argument. Some investors were forced to admit on the witness stand that partnering with Shkreli was ""the greatest investment I've ever made,"" he added.

The lawyer also argued that a drug company official who testified for the government was biased. If Shkreli is found guilty of a felony, Brafman said, the company would have clear grounds for forcing him out as CEO in 2014 and would gain ammunition in its $65 million lawsuit against him. Shkreli claims he was wrongfully terminated and is owed millions.

With a guilty verdict, ""Retrophin pops a Champagne cork,"" he said.

After the arguments, the judge instructed the jurors on the law before sending them home for the weekend. Deliberations are set to begin Monday.

Shkreli became notorious for using another drug company to raise the price of a life-saving drug 5,000 percent and for trolling his critics on social media, where he's been dubbed ""Pharma Bro.""

The defendant didn't testify. But he made his thoughts on the case known on Facebook, where he called it ""bogus.""

This story has been corrected to show that the $65 million refers to damages sought in a lawsuit, not a $65 million stake in a drug company."

He finally come to say yeah. Please join me. This tune into the. Hi everybody. I'm Peter Travers welcome to popcorn where we tell you what's happening at the movies and if you haven't heard about a movie called what for the plant in the eighth then. You're living under a rock somewhere and you've got to come out from there and see it this weekend. Relax the reasons it's a terrific movie but the principal reason being my guest and circuit. Who performs at fees are in it giving. I think one of the best performances you're gonna see anywhere this year or golden years before we do it but can and bag thing. I don't mean to but you would just really. He sort of us thank you and you know we've we've talked before. What it is that you do in kind of doing everything. But the whole idea of motion capture. Is still far from some people including members of the academy band. With a that its own steam to comprehend what it it so here we have a moment now to say. I'm gonna look at human figure on the set of war of the planet the this isn't something that computer created a salute. Why are you doing how do you come on with what do you dress like what goes. I mean you know that the basis is preaching. That. Brilliant performance capture it is it's a technology to function cameras at different bunch of cameras what we have these cameras filming us now. Which is what we you have all the film's second shooting on mr. Perry 65 cameras or whatever but. But we just have another bunch of cameras as world record performances. So and so we were we were has mounted camera and then we have. 360 degree cameras which are picking up leave Monica's two lawsuits so trachsel physical movement and then we have markers and offered to track while facial expressions. If you drive you crazy love and ordered all but the point the point is there is no different. No difference apple in the process of acting. With the opening that parity you're going to make up in the morning you put like Woody Williams and goes in puts on his makeup puts on his posture and we placing together for the homeless and and and adults in my helmet and we go with privacy together to you know. We there's no difference in acting I mean if you to go back to the original. John Chambers makeup of the regional planning the gates in the evenings and of those guys that decision in voting and came home to those guys have to sit and make up for 5000 had layers of fun when latex and rubber which kind of basically excuse that they face and and the way we could do on the embassy documentary Kim Hunter was to try to force these facial expressions to make this thing kind of moved. To do what we are courts act and well it's like up. I think so yeah yeah and and we performance catch you playing in really timely. You know you you know from the movie it was seen a lot of these scenes played in close up and they vary in terrible moments and very emotional ones and and and so are the acting processes is you know bumping banging on about this for years is no different than. 222 screen acting in the conventional sense except you know putting on makeup before he. And a very talented team digital artists visual effects office in the painting owned a virtual mind. What you'll today. I thought win what you did with gone. Was and and still is in many ways the most extraordinary use of that process to create a cash. You did. You know it yet secure voice it's everything that you're doing no matter how twisted he looks because of what motion capture it. But now I think in Cesar UBU. Actually equaled. You know this is an extraordinary things have just. I don't want to give away too much about it but sent apple little what's going on with these are well. The course of the three films we've seen him go from being. Orphans chimpanzee who was the recipient of this alzheimer's drug which which of course. For humans went wrong and the times the flu viruses and flu and what oh the humanity that the city's. If it holds his intelligence. It is cognitive skills as emotional. Growth you know what when where I was playing as a young infant chimpanzees used who taught by human beings James Franco's character. You know he was very and he he's he's he's loved what seems inevitable so and so fullest as a human being was approached him as a as a human in the eye and skin. The sense of him being outside a so that when he gets thrown into. The century with a league operates as something faced with the risen chimpanzees and bonobos. You know a running things he he he feels out of sorts that such. But but yet he's perfectly places as the outsider to be an empathetic character trying to galvanize rumble through non politics 22 in particular. Species including humans so easy as this and pathetic parent to soak in the second review. Do one. When we see him evolve and grow into this leader of you know movement of a society that's beginning to religion. We we we see him get week's BC him. Create rules we see him crates structure for society becomes of all the figure in Britain has children. And in this movie. He's always trying to broker peaceful deal with humanity he wants he was tours to fund peaceful solution to sit com from which is escalate. Then we jump forward into war we've we've we've where we find you know war has started and it was started. It was thought about it didn't same experience. Of of his relationship he seizes relationship you've been. And that pitched into this horrendous. War both sides. Desperate clinging on for survival I am he yet. You know c.s are still trying to to fund who worry fruit and triumph for the peaceful solution that is sure to that the beginning in this movie. When events happen with them too much away that affect him deeply and personally and sentinel for this project tree of of hatred and revenge. And we see a completely different side of season. Meanwhile of course he's the bolts to this what human life the most human life that we have ever seen so it's an incredible sort of contradiction but so. How does he go can you give me a little bit locally of how he starts because he's making animal fans and then suddenly. That voice matures into something that sounds like Cesar Pastrana what is it how does that sound when it seemed when he began well. You know he. This is this is again one of the many hawks of the Jenny plane disease has been these linguistic kind of growth that way to communicate to the right says so he was told to sign by the judge Frederick character in the first film. And so you know seize Cesar hung you know he would sign a new level leased this you know. Sutton pieces of sign language but then that in the first. Movie you. You warn you. That he would systems are close victory chimpanzee kind of global mobile units monkey chimpanzee but legislation through to the first words often. Which is which is through an emotional response to seeing. So of his client being brutalized in the right way he screams mode for the first time it's it's like a rule it's like a thoughtful reliable. Emotional response which is not pitches which is almost an an and could make that was like well. Yeah. You know it's kind of like it is but that is that comes out of something that is. Believable that a chimpanzee could do you know so surgery in the course of tool. We see them tens of Austin he's beginning to use human language to mean that you. Editors are prone to weigh so in the first NATO's wearing chimpanzee and a litre chimpanzee benches just went that surrounds. Much more Cubans in the second media war mouth guards to stop over articulating. Words. And and and sees a speech was found it was every single woods kind of I've found in the moment he's full prices as a slower to get themselves to work so that is so it becomes something alive. He would say. Wolf. You know and and it's every single woods chewed on missile was found and you know in this movie a you know again the times Austin he's he's the connection of woods' two expression. Is less.

The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said the death of Lt. Aaron Allan of the police department in Southport, just outside of Indianapolis, was the department's first line-of-duty death.

The shooting happened Thursday at about 2:30 p.m., when Allan and an officer from the Homecroft Police responded to a report of a crash, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said.

""As Lt. Allan approached the inverted vehicle to assist, shots were fired by one of the vehicle's occupants,"" police said in a statement.

According to ABC affiliate RTV6 in Indianapolis, a witness at the scene said the driver was upside down in the car when he began shooting at Allan.

The Homecroft police officer ""and an off-duty Johnson County Sheriff's Deputy, who had stopped to help, returned fire striking one of the individuals,"" police said. ""Both people inside the car were taken to Eskenazi Hospital, one for injuries sustained from being shot, and the other from injuries believe sustained during the crash.""

Allan, 38, a husband and father, was hospitalized and later died, police said.

Jason Brown, 28, of Indianapolis, was arrested on suspicion of murder, according to police, though he has not yet been formally charged. The Marion County Prosecutors Office will make a charging decision, police said, calling the investigation ongoing.

The car's passenger was interviewed as a witness and released by police, authorities said.

Allan's death has left the law enforcement community grieving.

He had over 20 years of law enforcement experience and nearly six years of service with the Southport Police Department, the police said.

According to RTV6, Southport Police Chief Thomas Vaughn said of Allan, ""When a citizen or someone needed help he was one of the first guys that was always there. ... He was involved in the community and he was involved in reaching out to the youth.""

In 2015, Allan was named Officer of the Year after saving two lives the year before, RTV6 reported.

""They had a guy in cardiac arrest when he was working part-time at the fairgrounds and he saved his life,"" Vaughn said, according to RTV6. ""He also had another incident where someone had overdosed on heroin and he was there with [overdose antidote] Narcan. He searched for about two hours in the rain to find her.""

""His mom told me today that he'd always wanted to be a policeman,"" Vaughn said, according to RTV6. ""He took that to heart.""

The Southport Police wrote on Twitter, ""Please keep Lt. Allan and his family in your thoughts.""

The Indiana State Police tweeted, ""We grieve with @SouthportPD over the loss of Lt. Aaron Allen."""

Bernie Sanders said Monday that while his campaign wants to win in Iowa, the outcome of the caucus will not make or break his campaign.

“Of course we want to win here but if we end up getting two delegates less than Hillary Clinton - why is that the end?” he told reporters from the steps of his campaign bus after making a quick stop to talk to volunteers at his Iowa campaign head quarters in Des Moines. Sanders is neck and neck in the polls with Hillary Clinton in this first caucus state. He said regardless of the result in this first contest, he's in it for the long haul.

“This is a national campaign. We are in to win at the convention,” he continued. “We are taking this all the way.”

According to the Senator, his campaign has hosted over 100 town meetings in Iowa. He told fans Monday morning that as of yesterday over 70,000 people in the state have come to see him speak in person.



As for tonight? Sanders said it is all about voter turnout. “You got a tied ball game. We will win tonight if voter turnout is high. We will struggle tonight if voter turnout is low.”"

But creator Larry David said it's the perfect time for the show to return.

David, 70, took the stage with his co-stars Jeff Garlin, Susie Essman, J.B. Smoove, and executive producer Jeff Schaffer as part of the Television Critics Association summer press tour on Wednesday.

When a reporter asked David why he chose to have the show return this year, he replied: ""Why not?""

""I'm not a misser, so to speak,"" he continued. ""I don't really miss things [or] people that much, but I was missing it, and I was missing these idiots, so I thought yeah, what the hell?""

Season nine of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" is set to premiere on October 1.

The actor also admitted he has a very selfish reason for the show's highly anticipated return.

""And I got tired of people asking me, 'Is the show coming back?' I couldn't face that question anymore,"" David said. ""I wasn't ready to say no, never, and I kept saying, 'Oh, you know, maybe, who knows?' So I thought yeah, I wouldn't have to be asked that anymore.""

“ ” I got tired of people asking me 'Is the show coming back?

Schaffer also shed light on what viewers can expect from season nine of ""Curb,"" which will continue to follow David's neurotic onscreen character of the same name, along with his manager, Jeff, portrayed by Garlin, and their friends.

Schaffer, the show's executive producer, said ""it'll be self-evident"" what David has been up to since the show's been off the air, adding that the series will go to a ""very fun, crazy, strange place.""

It's no secret that David used drama from his own life as inspiration for some of the most awkward moments in season nine.

""The amount of uncomfortable situations he's been in ... it's like we're sitting in the Fort Knox of awkward,"" Schaffer said.

http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/a-chess-master-with-an-unpredictable-style-and-the-hopes-of-a-nation,newyorker,A Chess Master with an Unpredictable Style and the Hopes of a Nation,[],"Aronian has won dozens of tournaments and global admiration, and he has become a bona-fide star in his native country—but he has yet to win chess’s greatest prize, the World Championship. He grew up, he told me, surrounded by reminders of the time “when your country used to be a strong country.” And the longer he shoulders the hopes of a nation desperate for homegrown success, the tougher it is becoming, it seems, to fulfill his immense potential.

Three years later, shortly after the Soviet Union collapsed and Armenia became an independent nation, Levon Aronian, under Khachiyan’s tutelage, quit school to focus on chess full time. Now thirty-four, Aronian is ranked seventh in the world and has one of the highest ratings in chess history. Armenia, a nation of three million people, is the game’s perennial overachiever. Per capita, more players from Armenia have attained the coveted status of grandmaster than any other country, and Armenia has won men’s gold at three of the last six Chess Olympiads, the highest honor for a national team. Armenia’s President is also the head of the country’s chess association, and he has spearheaded a chess revolution: Armenia is now the only country where the game is a required part of the national curriculum, and its top players receive a state stipend. “For a small, landlocked country, chess is a particularly ingenious way, and effective way, of mobilizing both competitive spirit and sports competition and intellectual discipline, without the need for huge infrastructural resources and, of course, financial spending,” the Armenian-American writer Peter Balakian told me recently.

In 1988, war broke out between Armenia and its Soviet Republic neighbor of Azerbaijan, over the long-disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region. It was another tragedy in a century of tragedies for Armenia, going back to the genocide carried out by the Ottoman Empire against the Armenian people, beginning in 1915. When the 1988 war began, thousands of ethnic Armenians who lived in Azerbaijan fled their homes. One of them was Melikset Khachiyan, a chess player who studied the game, as a teen-ager, under Tigran Petrosian, Armenia’s greatest-ever player. Khachiyan had shown early promise, but a shot at the game’s highest level, in an era of legends like Kasparov, Karpov, and Tal, eluded him. Now he needed a place to stay. He headed to Yerevan, Armenia’s pretty, pink-stoned capital; there, Grigory and Seda Aronian offered him a room in their modest home on the edge of town. Rather than pay rent, they suggested, he could teach their six-year-old son, Levon, chess.

Aronian reached the level of grandmaster in 2000, when he was seventeen, but the Armenian Chess Federation repeatedly overlooked him in favor of older, more established players. After the A.C.F. froze him out of a tournament in India, his mother decided she had seen enough and uprooted the family to Berlin. Suddenly the Aronians were members of the seven million-strong spyurk (“spread”), the Armenian diaspora created mostly by the 1915 genocide. Unencumbered by Armenia’s infighting and isolation, Aronian flourished. He played over a hundred matches in his first year in Germany. In 2002, he won the Armenian Chess Championship and became World Junior Champion. He is now a rich man.

Aronian and Khachiyan began walking an hour and a half to play at chess clubs in Yerevan. Soon Aronian was winning tournaments, and making money on the side by beating businessmen in hotel lobbies. Small-time sponsors came and went; an airmail firm put in some cash—at one point, Aronian even travelled abroad with the mail. By the time he was thirteen, he was making enough to support his family. They needed the money, and Aronian turned that desperation into a strength, playing aggressively and unconventionally against his studious, better-dressed opponents. “I had to kick their ass,” Aronian told me. He added, “They look in your eyes and they understand that you are a barbarian, and the kids generally fear the ones who are savages.” He paused as we spoke to prevent a waitress from taking some half-finished plates. “There is still the barbarian in me—I won’t let my food be taken away.”

I first saw Aronian play in 2015, at a “blitz,” a high-speed chess event in Berlin. Most leading chess players appear tightly wound at the board; Aronian looks like he’s waiting for an Old-Fashioned. Last summer, we met at a swanky new hotel in downtown Yerevan. As we ate lunch, people stared and took selfies. Aronian is raffish and charming, with unkempt hair and louder clothes than his chess-playing peers tend to favor. His chess skills were a route out of poverty. In the years following independence, blockades with Turkey and Azerbaijan, which still hold today, killed trade. Blackouts were common then; Aronian and Khachiyan would often practice by candlelight, up to six hours a day. Aronian loved the concept of sacrifice, and the idea that he could do anything so long as he achieved one goal: kill the king. He went out little, forfeiting friendships and the trappings of boyhood.

In 1963, when Petrosian took on the Russian Mikhail Botvinnik for the World Championship, thousands camped out in Yerevan, watching each move relayed via telegraph to a giant demonstration board in the city’s Opera Square. Petrosian’s victory caused a “chess boom” in the country, Mikayel Andriasyan, the secretary-general of the A.C.F., told me. In recent years, when Armenia has won the Chess Olympiad, there have been similar celebrations. (Armenia did not compete at last year’s Olympiad, because it was staged in the Azerbaijani capital city, Baku: the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict remains unresolved.) Aronian played a key role in all of those victories: in 2004, Serzh Sargsyan, a former government defense minister, became the chief of the A.C.F., and he coaxed Aronian, who had climbed into the top hundred of the world rankings, back to the national team. (Four years later, Sargsyan was elected President of Armenia.)

By 2005, Aronian was ranked fifth in the world and became a national hero in Armenia. Stardom is a great honor, Aronian told me, but it’s double-edged. “Some people are cheering you up, while some people who are generally unhappy, they’re sharing their unhappiness,” he said. (Taxi drivers, he added, are particularly blunt with their criticism.) Aronian splits his time between Berlin and Yerevan, where he lives with his fiancée, Arianne Caoili, who has represented both the Philippines and Australia in the Women’s Chess Olympiad and also works as a consultant. Aronian has a small circle of friends and rarely goes out alone. Most days he listens to classical composers—“Bach for his spirituality and passion, Bruckner for his structure, Schubert for his serenity and firm structures, Mahler for the ways he goes from small to grandiose, Shostakovich for the gentle darkness”—and practices chess moves for hours. He still wears his emotions on his sleeve. He often loses chasing improbable wins when he should settle for a draw. And he takes losses badly, blaming anything from the venue to the general public. After a poor performance at a tournament in Sharjah, in the United Arab Emirates, in February, he told me that he lost because he was “not in the mood.”

“For me, Levon is more someone who needs things to flow,” the five-time world champion Vishy Anand told me. Wesley So, a Filipino-born U.S. player ranked second in the world, told me over e-mail that, when playing Aronian, “you never know if any move is straightforward and it’s best to assume it isn’t.” His swashbuckling manner recalls eccentric former greats like Bobby Fischer and Kasparov, and contrasts with the game’s contemporary masters, quiet geniuses who play with quantum precision. “You’re free to express yourself in the game of chess,” Aronian told me, comparing it to his beloved classical music. “You can play anything as long as you are determined to fight for the ideas you put in your moves.”

From 2012 to 2014, Aronian was often ranked second in the world; most people in chess expected him to challenge Norway’s Magnus Carlsen , the three-time, and current, world champion. But when Aronian performed badly at the 2014 Candidates Tournament, the event that chooses who will face off against the reigning world champion, it seemed to spark a decline. Last year he performed erratically, falling well below the mark required to face Carlsen for the world title in New York last November. A month after the Candidates Tournament, I met up with Aronian at a hotel in London. He had just competed at the London Chess Classic, drawing six matches and losing two, placing eighth out of ten entrants. It was cold and gray, and Aronian was tired. “I know that I deserve, one day, to become world champion,” he said. The tournament in Sharjah, two months later, was another chance to rebound, but it didn’t go according to plan. “I haven’t yet achieved anything in my career,” he told me after that event, on the phone. He added, “I want to have a crushing victory somewhere. Something that will make me proud.”

“He is probably too emotional, and the sight of his dream being close makes his vision blurry,” the Dutch player Anish Giri, who is ranked twelfth in the world, told me. Maybe getting some distance from it has begun to help: in June, Aronian won the Norway Chess tournament in Stavanger, beating Carlsen with a dramatic sacrifice that, improbably, he had held back since 2003. “There’s no parallel in sport for that,” the writer and chess player Martin Pein told me, speaking of Aronian’s long-delayed stratagem. “What it demonstrates is someone who thinks incredibly deeply, who’s analyzed a lot of ideas in an almost profound way.”

The intervening period has been characteristically unpredictable for Aronian. He placed badly at a tournament in Leuven, in Belgium, before sweeping to victory at a German event with a round to spare. Last week he struggled at a competition in Geneva that comprises part of the qualifying criteria to join the game’s élite at next year’s Candidates Tournament. His next chance to shine is at the three-hundred-thousand-dollar-prize-fund Sinquefield Cup, which begins July 31st, in St. Louis. Aronian looks likely to make the Candidates cut, but it’s not guaranteed. Once again, he must sweat over his future.

Though many of the game’s current leaders are in their twenties, history suggests that Aronian is at an age where his powers should peak; Petrosian won the world title at thirty-three. Aronian wants to give Armenia another victory, and help it move on from past sorrows. “I feel that I’m owing my nation, my country, a lot for their love,” he told me. Failure, he believes, would not only be a personal but a national disappointment. “We’re always dreaming our days will come, and some justice will be delivered,” he said. “I feel that this is my duty.”"
http://www.newyorker.com/culture/listening-booth/tyler-the-creator-grows-on-where-this-flower-blooms,newyorker,"Tyler, the Creator Grows on “Where This Flower Blooms”",[],"A lot has changed since the twenty-six-year-old enfant terrible Tyler, the Creator released his début mixtape, “Bastard,” in 2009. For starters, Odd Future, the California rap collective he founded, is now more or less defunct, with several of its members, including Earl Sweatshirt, Syd tha Kyd, and Frank Ocean, having embarked on successful solo careers. It is also more difficult, in the age of six-second viral content and ice-bucket challenges, for natural provocateurs such as Tyler—infamous for eating a roach in a music video and humping a bag of golf clubs—to grab people’s attention via the Internet. At some point, even the class clown has to decide that it is time to grow up.

That is exactly what happens on Tyler’s new solo album, “Flower Boy,” a taut, forty-six-minute collection of fifteen songs, in which a young man whose lyrics were once marked by casual misogyny and homophobia trades in his trolling behavior for more introspective material. This is especially true on the song “Where This Flower Blooms,” an ebullient piano track that features backing vocals from Ocean and lyrics that suggest that Odd Future’s perpetual prankster has finally decided to embrace the journey toward adulthood, and to open up about the isolation, boredom, self-doubt, and loneliness that come with it.

advertisement

On “Where This Flower Blooms,” Tyler reminisces about a time when things were less complicated, and reflects on the life of a young man trying to learn about himself on his own time and on his own terms. “Tell these black kids they could be who they are / Dye your hair blue, Shit, I’ll do it too,” he raps, telegraphing his dedication to hip-hop’s next generation of insurgents. The lines are delivered in the same sly, deep, guttural tone that Tyler is known for, but this time they sound a little more sincere. Perhaps they are coming from someone who has grown more comfortable living in his own skin.

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/the-meaning-of-the-gops-health-care-fiasco,newyorker,The Meaning of the G.O.P.’s Health-Care Fiasco,[],"Anyone still inclined to pity the Senate Republicans might pause to examine Donald Trump’s taunting of them, at a meeting last Wednesday at the White House , for their failure to blow up the American health-care system. A range of Trump’s traits were on display: lying (he wildly misrepresented the terms of the most recent Senate bill); an obsession with betrayal (he complained that senators who were his friends “might not be very much longer”); hinting at retribution (he said of Dean Heller, who had helped stall an earlier version of the bill, “He wants to remain a senator, doesn’t he?”); and inconsistency (he can’t seem to decide whether he wants to replace the bill or just repeal it). The one plausible notion Trump presented at the meeting was that, under President Obama, congressional Republicans had “an easy route: we’ll repeal, we’ll replace, and he’s never going to sign it.” Trump added, “But I’m signing it.” In other words, Trump had turned the Republicans into people with a real job—a hard job—and revealed their inability to perform it.

Yet, at the meeting, when Trump said that Obamacare is “gone, it’s failed—it’s not going to be around,” he was just repeating what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his colleagues have said any number of times. The bill got as far as it has in the Senate the same way that a similar one was passed in the House, with lies told in public and callousness dealt in private. Republican legislators peddled conspiracy theories about Obamacare being part of a scheme to strip Americans of their freedoms. The Senate version was drafted in secret and reflected an almost complete indifference to the needs of any Americans, really, apart from the wealthiest. McConnell, for his part, greeted Trump’s White House rant as a welcome act of statesmanship, portraying the President as a latter-day Lyndon Johnson “totally engaged,” behind the scenes, in the effort to round up votes.

In acting as though the bill still has a chance, McConnell may be undertaking another Trump-like maneuver: reducing matters of state to the level of farce. The Republicans have fifty-two Senate seats—fifty-one, for the moment, given the absence of John McCain, who last week received a diagnosis of brain cancer. This means that, with Vice-President Mike Pence as a tiebreaker, McConnell can lose only one vote. Every configuration of the bill so far has been unacceptable to more than one senator, for reasons both good and bad.

As the senators skittered between plans that would result in the loss of insurance coverage for as many as twenty-two or maybe thirty-two million Americans, some of them, including Heller and Susan Collins, expressed genuine concern about the devastating effect the bill would have on their constituents. Others, notably Jerry Moran, Rand Paul, and Mike Lee, insisted that the bill didn’t do enough to scrub Obamacare, and much of the Medicaid system, from the landscape. The damage that a repeal-without-replace plan would inflict was too much for Collins, Shelley Moore Capito, and Lisa Murkowski, who said that they would vote against bringing any such bill to the floor. For that, they were called traitors to their party, and threatened with primary challengers. Meanwhile, Ted Cruz slipped in an amendment that made the bill even worse, by opening a door to “junk” insurance plans and exorbitant premiums for people with preëxisting conditions.

All of this might suggest either that the G.O.P. was a party stumbling away in shame from a self-inflicted defeat or one that was narrowly saved by the obstinacy of a few of its members, who prevented it from doing something truly harmful to the lives of Americans. But to say that the divisions in the Republican caucus represent a coherent ideological debate between well-defined factions—business, populist, Freedom Caucus, libertarian—would be to assign to the process a dignity it doesn’t merit. The Republican leadership’s argument of last resort, when whipping votes, has been that the Party has to do something dramatic about Obamacare simply because, for the past seven years, it has said that it would. That is an explanation of a quagmire, not a call to arms. Capito, in defending her dissent, said, “ I did not come to Washington to hurt people ,” but it is far from clear what the Republicans did come to Congress to do. No one seems to have had an Obamacare-replacement plan at hand that makes even mathematical sense.

Still, McConnell has said that he will delay the Senate’s August recess, if necessary, to try for another vote on something: repeal, replace, or a thrown-together bill to be named later; his zigzagging mirrors that of the President. If this attempt fails, the backup plan seems to be to turn the matter over to the executive branch and let it commit whatever acts of regulatory, budgetary, and administrative vandalism it can, to break the system bit by bit. For example, it could withhold crucial cost-sharing subsidies, or decline to defend Obamacare against various lawsuits that its opponents, including the House Republicans, have brought against it. Uncertainty on such points is a major reason that some of the Obamacare exchanges are in a state of disarray. As with the primaries last year, the Party, with no center or true direction, may end up just leaving it to Trump.

The final drive to pass the bill will be another measure of how Trumpist the G.O.P. has become—and more tests of its character are on the way. This week, Donald Trump, Jr., will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about his meeting with various Russians; Jared Kushner, the President’s son-in-law, will appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee, though in closed session. The Republicans will have to decide how they will conduct those hearings and whether they are willing to insure that the investigation into Russia’s involvement in the Presidential election remains intact.

That question, too, just became more difficult. On the same day that Trump chastised the senators, he also humiliated one of their former colleagues, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, by saying, in an interview with the Times , that he would never have chosen Sessions if he’d known that he would recuse himself from the proceedings. Trump also seemed to confirm reports that his lawyers are investigating Robert Mueller, the special counsel on the case, in a search for excuses to get rid of him.

At this point, it will look like negligence if the Republicans don’t have a plan for what they will do if the President pushes Sessions out or orders the firing of Mueller. According to the Washington Post , Trump has asked his lawyers about the extent of his power to pardon his associates and family members, which would also serve to scuttle the investigation. He reportedly even asked about pardoning himself. The Senate Republicans may be wishing they had that option, too. ♦"
http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/kyrie-irvings-anxiety-of-influence,newyorker,Kyrie Irving’s Anxiety of Influence,[],"When it was reported, last week, that Kyrie Irving, the Cleveland Cavaliers’ star point guard, wanted to be traded, many basketball fans thought back to the defining moment of his young and superlative career: his game-winning three-pointer in the 2016 N.B.A. Finals, against the favored Golden State Warriors. With fifty-three seconds left in the decisive seventh game, and the score tied, Irving was being guarded by Steph Curry, the league M.V.P. He put the ball between his legs and glided slowly toward the basket while looking for an opening; then, with a quick dribble to his right, he sprang up, leaping over Curry’s outstretched arm and launching a deep jumper. He’d created space to score where, a fraction of a second before, there hadn’t been an inch. The play punctuated a series in which the Cavs made history twice over: the franchise had never before won a championship, and no team had ever come back from a three-games-to-one deficit in the Finals. LeBron James was named the series M.V.P., but it was Irving who had taken the last shot.

“All I was thinking about in the back of my mind was Mamba Mentality,” he told reporters afterward. He was referring to the five-time Lakers champion Kobe Bryant , who at one point dubbed himself the Black Mamba. It was like an artist citing his influences. Bryant was an unstoppable scorer and a clutch performer with a shoot-first mentality and ferocious self-regard. (For years, he feuded with Shaquille O’Neal over bragging rights as the team’s principal star, and O’Neal was eventually traded to Miami.) Irving’s homage to the Mamba was a statement of purpose: he saw himself as the kind of player who should have the ball in his hands as the clock was ticking down. On almost any other team, no one would question whether Irving was on that level. But Irving is on the same team as LeBron James, a superstar rightly called the King. And one had to bend a knee. “I watched Beethoven tonight,” Irving went on to say. “LeBron James composed a game.” The Mamba wasn’t wholly incompatible with the Maestro—Irving is nothing if not a brilliant soloist—but the two pronouncements struck a slightly discordant note.

If Irving had modelled his aggressiveness on Bryant’s, he’d also learned, in a way that Bryant seemingly never did, how to share the stage. James had rejoined Cleveland, his original team, three years into Irving’s pro career. “You see yourself being one of those great players eventually,” Irving has said, referring to James. “And then he ends up joining [your team]. . . . Now you have to almost take a step back and observe.” James pronounced himself a “mentor” at the time, and told Sports Illustrated , “I think I can help Kyrie Irving become one of the best points guards in our league.” Since then, Irving has faced a rare dilemma, perhaps most familiar to Scottie Pippen, who for years was second fiddle to Michael Jordan: he is playing beside someone who is quite possibly the most dominant player in the history of the sport. (Pippen excelled in that role, but when, on one occasion during Jordan’s baseball-playing hiatus, he was asked to defer not to Jordan but to Toni Kukoc , he rebelled.) Ever since Tyronn Lue took over as the Cavs’ head coach, in the middle of the 2016 season, Irving has been encouraged to shoot more and to cultivate his own game as a scorer. He took more shots than James did last year, and held the ball longer. Still, when James was on the bench, the Cavs were mightily outscored in the regular season, playoffs, and finals. But Irving’s restlessness has never had much to do with demonstrable metrics. He wants to move somewhere where he can be the “focal point,” he’s said, and “control” the ball. Playing alongside James for too long can be taxing in a paradoxical way. He’s a team player par excellence , known for making those around him better. But it’s a configuration that, for a soloing star like Irving, must feel like a constant apprenticeship.

For fans, the report about Irving’s demand was totally unexpected, even if the angst underlying it should not have been. And it inevitably raised psychological questions. Was his decision to leave Cleveland an act of hubristic self-sabotage? Did Irving underestimate how hard it would be to earn another appearance in the finals without his current cast? Was he betraying the team’s potential legacy? Maybe. But he deserves some credit, too, or at least a measure of sympathy. The league has been trending in an unsettling direction for the past few years—superstars are joining forces to win championships. Most notably, Kevin Durant, a former M.V.P., joined the Warriors team, which was already favored against Cleveland and had set a record for regular-season wins. (Russell Westbrook, the co-star he left behind on his previous team, the Oklahoma City Thunder, went on to have one of the league’s great individual campaigns; Kobe Bryant has said Westbrook reminds him of himself .) Irving has apparently asked to move in the opposite direction. At twenty-five years old, with four All Star appearances and a championship ring to his name, he would be uncoupling himself from one of the most powerful teams in the league. He wants to make his own way, even if that means wandering in the wilderness.

Irving reportedly told the Cavs’ front office that he preferred to play for one of four other teams—the Knicks, Spurs, Heat, or Timberwolves. There’s no guarantee he’ll end up in any of those places, and recent reports suggest that others teams, such as the Suns, might make a play for him. Since the news of Irving’s defection broke, the Cavs’ owner, Dan Gilbert, has insisted that the situation is “fluid” and that he expects Irving to show up for training camp in September. The team’s management is performing triage at this point; the Cavs have fallen apart in spectacular fashion over the summer. Just days before the draft, last month, Gilbert fired the team’s general manager, then proceeded to miss a string of crucial opportunities to fill out the roster with another marquee talent, such as Paul George or Carmelo Anthony. There are rumors that James is contemplating a move to Los Angeles after the coming season, when he’ll become a free agent.

The future will be messy whether Irving stays or goes. Either way, though, perhaps he’s finally found the kind of protagonist’s role that has eluded him. As the Black Mamba careered toward retirement, in 2016, he made an appraisal that could prove prophetic, and which suggested that a selfish player wasn’t necessarily detrimental to a team’s fortunes. The Cavs, he said, needed a “ lightning rod ,” a player who could create sparks, an instigator and unpredictable personality capable of generating a particular sort of fiery energy. “LeBron’s not that person,” he explained. “He brings people together. That’s what he does naturally, and he’s phenomenal at it, but you have to have somebody else that’s going to create that tension. Maybe it’s Kyrie?”"
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/can-poetry-change-your-life,newyorker,Can Poetry Change Your Life?,[],"The first eight pages of Michael Robbins’s new book, “ Equipment for Living: On Poetry and Pop Music ” (Simon & Schuster), make reference to Annie Dillard, Harold Bloom, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Elton John, Kenneth Burke, Geoffrey Hill, Kenneth Koch, Adam Phillips, Frank O’Hara, Emerson, Boethius, Nietzsche, Freud, and Miley Cyrus. The book is a collection of mostly previously published pieces, some on poetry, some on pop music, some on both, written, as the names suggest, in a critical style that could be called advanced pop. Advanced-pop criticism would be criticism premised on the belief that you can talk about cultural goods loved uncritically by millions in terms originally developed to talk about cultural goods known mainly to an overeducated few. Advanced pop is Boethius and Springsteen, Artaud and the Ramones, and it yields sentences like “I assume that what Burke”—the literary theorist Kenneth Burke—“says about poetry applies, mutatis mutandis, to the songs of Def Leppard.” It’s erudite but caj, geeky and hip, alienated and savvy—on the inside of the outside. Another word for the attitude might be “Brooklyn,” which is indeed where, as an author’s bio unnecessarily informs us, Michael Robbins lives. “Equipment for Living” is funny and smart. It does feel a few bricks shy of a tome. The first and last chapters perform the same work: they unpack, uneasily, the claim stated in the title, which is that poems and songs can make a difference. Most of the chapters are essay-reviews, ranging in length from very brief to brief. Robbins has a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, and an excellent discussion of rhyme in the work of Paul Muldoon is apparently adapted from his dissertation. To fill things out, there is a twenty-eight-page “Playlist,” consisting of staff-picks-type encomiums on the author’s favorites, such as: Skip James “Devil Got My Woman” (1931) Sometimes I think this song defines the limits of what is humanly possible. Sometimes I think it exceeds them. And: Wallace Stevens “The Man with the Blue Guitar,” Canto XXV (1937) A rumpus, a rollick, a roll in the hay . . . There’s only one full-dress essay in the book, and it’s much more heavy-duty than the rest. The subject is the poetry of Frederick Seidel, and the essay handles a familiar critical problem—the morality of bad taste, the Jeff Koons–Michel Houellebecq–Bret Easton Ellis problem—expertly if not entirely originally. The essay does include observations like “The death drive is figured here as the desire to literalize the trope of the subject’s dispersal.” When I hear the words “literalize the trope,” I reach for my remote. Hyperbole is an ever-present danger up there on the high-low tightrope. What helps the critic keep his or her balance is the acknowledgment that it is hyperbole, that there is a rhetoric of aesthetic experience—the experience of reading poems or listening to songs we’re strongly attached to—that is always in excess of the actual content. If you’re going to write about Skip James, it doesn’t make sense to strive for a judicious appraisal. You want to record the temperature at its hottest. By now, a lot of writers have done this sort of thing with Skip James and other old bluesmen, a sacred category for serious pop critics ever since those musicians were “discovered” by rock-and-roll (that is, white) audiences, in the nineteen-sixties, but Robbins can do it with seventeenth-century lyrics as well. You also need to concede that the experience cools fairly quickly, and Robbins is alert to that, too. “ No one has ever changed his life because of a poem or song,” he says in a chapter on metal, with reference to Blake, Milton, Rilke, William Empson, Peter Sloterdijk, Ozzy Osbourne, and Kant. “Changing your life is for Simone Weil or the Buddha. The rest of us need German poetry and Norwegian black metal because they provide the illusion that we are changing, or have changed, or will change, or even want to change our lives.” I don’t completely agree, but it’s a wise caution. Another advanced-pop premise is that everything is happening now. Springsteen and Dylan speak to our current condition, and so do Boethius and Sappho. The envelope may be postmarked 600 B.C.E., but when you open it there is a letter inside, and it’s just for you. The responsible scholarly impulse is to historicize: those words were never intended for you, they signified something completely different in 600 B.C.E. than they do today, and so on. That’s all true. But the text still has a sting. It’s the news that stayed news. Robbins is more interested in the inarticulable or barely articulable sting than he is in reconstructing social relations in the Mediterranean gift economy. (I think you can do both, in fact, and that putting the “then” together with the “now” is the point of doing criticism.) A writer with a playlist of culture heroes must also have a list of the undeserving, the fake, and the fallen, and Robbins does not disappoint us. He writes of the poet James Wright, “It is easy to feel that, if fetal alcohol syndrome could write poetry, it would write this poetry.” He suggests that Robert Hass “has made a career out of flattering middlebrow sensibilities with cheap mystery.” Of Charles Simic: “If the worst are full of passionate intensity, Simic would seem to be in the clear.” He calls Simon and Garfunkel’s “The Sound of Silence” “wimpy crap.” He says that Patti Smith’s memoir “Just Kids” is “highly acclaimed despite her apparent belief that serious writing is principally a matter of avoiding contractions.” His reaction to Neil Young’s memoir is “It’s depressing to learn that one of your heroes writes like a composition student aiming for the earnest tone of a public service announcement.” The Jedi master of this mode of criticism—its presiding spirit, really—is Pauline Kael, the subject of an admiring chapter in “Equipment for Living.” Robbins calls her “the first tastemaker I trusted implicitly.” A lot of Kael’s criticism, like Robbins’s, is buildups and takedowns, but that kind of criticism can get interesting when the writer has to figure out why something that should be good is not, or why something that has no right to be good actually might be. I enjoyed almost all of “Equipment for Living,” but I found Robbins most clever and entertaining when he is trying to make sense of what redeems bands like Journey and Def Leppard, or poets like Dylan Thomas and James Dickey. Those are artists who now seem obviously gassy or fatuous—“Like a mammoth wheel of Monterey Jack left in the sun” is Robbins’s description of Journey’s hit song “Only the Young.” And he often decides that what redeems such works is that they once spoke to him, even if they don’t anymore. “Every song you loved when you were young turns into ‘Tintern Abbey,’ ” as he puts it. “I cannot paint / What then I was,” Wordsworth wrote in that poem, about revisiting the banks of the Wye as a grownup (only five years later, actually, but it’s a poem). Robbins expresses the sentiment this way: “As I listen to ‘Don’t Stop Believin’ ’ today, once again, in the arena of my soul, how high the highest Bic lights the dark.” You can’t go back to being fifteen, but you can remember with respect and longing that time of life, a time when, as Georg Lukács once put it, “the fire that burns in the soul is of the same essential nature as the stars.” Oh, no! Now I’m doing it! “Listening to most rock and roll now involves remembering what it used to do for me that it can’t anymore,” Robbins says. And, in fact, a surprising amount of pop-music criticism is bottled nostalgia, owls that fly at dusk. In preparation for writing about “Equipment for Living,” I got a copy of “ Shake It Up ” (Library of America), an anthology of fifty years of pop-music criticism, “from Elvis to Jay Z,” edited by Jonathan Lethem and Kevin Dettmar. I figured I would dip into its pages and refresh my recollection of the field of play. Many hours later, I had to force myself to put the thing down. A few of the essays in “Shake It Up” are advanced-pop criticism (e.g., the literary critic Richard Poirier on “Learning from the Beatles,” in Partisan Review ), but most are journalism, and the journalism beats the advanced-pop stuff cold. Partly this is because it was written for fans, so the writers could ignore the English department and other highbrow police. Partly it’s because pop-music journalism arose out of the intersection of early rock-and-roll magazines like Rolling Stone and Crawdaddy , when they still had an alternative-press aura, and the New Journalism, with its promiscuous use of the first person, and that gave it a confessional tone and a voice that suggested that we’re all on the same side in the struggle, whatever struggle it is. “Who are you kidding? You’re all about small government until you get stuck in a tree.” But rock criticism does appear to be fixated on what has been lost. It’s always beating back against the current. It seems that in the pop-music business the shelf life of authenticity is tragically short. Ellen Willis on Janis Joplin, Lester Bangs on Elvis Presley, Chuck Klosterman on Mötley Crüe, John Jeremiah Sullivan on Axl Rose, Eve Babitz on Jim Morrison, Geoffrey O’Brien on the Beatles: all those pieces are “Tintern Abbey”s, elegies for gifts that were squandered or misapplied or evanescent. O’Brien thinks it all began to go south for the Beatles after “Help!” And I used to think the Beatles were only worth listening to after “Help!”

But how are poems and pop songs “equipment for life”? Here the balance pole begins to wobble. “There is no limit to what a poem can’t do,” Robbins writes on one page; “poetry makes all sorts of things happen,” he says on the next. Which is it? He doesn’t want to give in to the fantasy that poems taught to and songs bought by millions of people are also subversive of the established order. But his own politics are Occupy-era politics, and he naturally wants to put his views together with his tastes. The teen-ager’s enthusiasm for Def Leppard must in some way belong with the mature man’s concerns about income inequality. He has a couple of ideas about how this might work. One is that the very excess of the aesthetic experience, the fact that it evaporates so fast upon contact with daily life, is a reminder of how impoverished daily life is. It seems that capitalism is to blame here. When capitalism is dead, Robbins suggests, we might not need poetry anymore. O.K., that’s one idea. His other idea is that the key to the real-world effectiveness of poems and songs is “form.” The invocation of form is awkward, for the same reason that advanced-pop criticism itself is inherently awkward, which is that most popular music, and especially popular music categorized as rock, is magnificently and unambiguously hostile to everything associated with the word “school.” And form is a very academic concept. It’s the shell in the game teachers play to hide content. The phrase “equipment for living” is taken from Kenneth Burke, who also wrote that form is “a public matter that symbolically enrolls us with allies who will share the burdens with us.” Robbins likes this. I think it means that the experience of poems and songs is shared with other people, even if often implicitly, and so it can be a means of achieving solidarity. Form “grounds us in a community,” Robbins says. This might be a little wishful. Reading poems is normally a solitary pastime, and so is a lot of music listening, except at concerts, where the emotions aren’t really your own. In any case, form cuts no political ice. The Rolling Stones’ “You Can’t Always Get What You Want,” once an anthem of antiwar protesters, is played at Trump rallies. I assume it instills feelings of solidarity among his supporters. With aesthetic experience in general, after a certain age, the effects are probably as much a product of what you bring to it as what you get from it. “Records are useful equipment for living, provided you don’t expect more from them than they contain,” Robbins says. This is an echo of Dylan—“Songs are songs,” Dylan once said; “I don’t believe in expecting too much out of any one thing”—and it seems about right. But what, in the end, do we get from poems and songs? “Aesthetic life is a sphere of self-directed activity whose external ramifications, despite periodic utopian exuberances, are minimal at best,” Robbins concludes (somewhat contradicting his “community” theory). Is this so? Are we past the days when people wrote poetry and read it for encouragement and guidance, the days when poetry was not merely a “self-directed activity” but was writing about something?

It certainly was once. On August 4, 1914, Great Britain declared war on Germany. On August 5th, the first war poem appeared in the London Times —“The Vigil,” by Henry Newbolt. By the end of the year, at least two anthologies of war poetry were out, “Poems of the Great War” and “Songs and Sonnets for England in War Time.” Many would follow. Around the time the fighting ended, four years later, more than two thousand British and Irish writers had written poems about the war. We might assume that the First World War inspired a lot of poems because that’s how people expressed themselves in the age of print, and that people express themselves differently today because the media are different. But we would assume wrong. Donald Trump was elected President on November 8, 2016. A poem about his election, “You’re Dead, America,” by Danez Smith, appeared on BuzzFeed on November 9th. A few days later, hundreds showed up in Washington Square Park for a pop-up poetry reading sponsored by the Academy of American Poets and the Web site Brain Pickings. Three days after the Inauguration, the Times columnist Nicholas Kristof announced a Donald Trump Poetry Contest. He got about two thousand submissions. Several anthologies with anti-Trump poems have already come out, including, in May, “ Resistance, Rebellion, Life: 50 Poems Now ” (Knopf), edited by Amit Majmudar, who was one of the winners in Kristof’s contest. Every crisis is an opportunity for poetry, even in the twenty-first century. There are anthologies of 9/11 poems and anthologies of Iraq War poems. There are climate-change poems, income-inequality poems, and Black Lives Matter poems. Claudia Rankine’s “ Citizen: An American Lyric ,” a book-length poem about race, identity, and the imagination, has sold almost two hundred thousand copies since it was published, in 2014. After the terrorist attacks in Paris on November 13, 2015, hundreds of thousands read “It is not Paris we should pray for,” posted on social media by the Indian poet Karuna Ezara Parikh. When the going gets stressful, the stressed want poems.

So why are people who write about poetry so defensive? Robbins gives the appearance of a man straining to come up with a rationale for bothering to read and write poems at all. And he’s an optimist. In “ The Hatred of Poetry ” (Farrar, Straus & Giroux), published last year, Ben Lerner argues that poems simply can’t do what people want them to do—create timeless moments, or express individual experiences with universal appeal, or create a sense of communal identity, or overturn existing social mores, or articulate “a measure of value beyond money.” All they can do is expose the impossibility of achieving any of these things by writing a poem. Of course people who don’t read poetry hate it, he says; it’s not doing what they mistakenly believe it’s supposed to do. But poets hate it, too. Poetry is a paradigm example of human inadequacy. In “ Why Poetry? ” (Ecco), out this summer, Matthew Zapruder defines a poet as a writer who is prepared “to reject all other purposes, in favor of the possibilities of language freed from utility.” Where people who are puzzled by poetry go wrong, he thinks, is in expecting poems to say something straightforward about life, to be useful. Poems are really about language—ultimately, about the impossibility of fixed meanings. Lerner and Zapruder are successful mid-career poets. (So is Robbins, who has brought out two collections with Penguin.) Lerner is also well known for his novels, “ Leaving the Atocha Station ” and “ 10:04 .” Zapruder has published four collections of poetry and was the editor of the Times Magazine poetry page. We can add to their books David Orr’s “ Beautiful and Pointless: A Guide to Modern Poetry ,” which came out in 2011. The title states the problem. “I can’t tell you why you should bother to read poems, or to write them,” Orr concludes. “I can only say that if you do choose to give your attention to poetry, as against all other things you might turn to instead, that choice can be meaningful.” Not the most robust commendation—and Orr is the poetry critic of the Times Book Review . How can it be the case that poems are ineffectual and self-absorbed ephemera when the Presidential election produced a Trump bump in the poetry world, when hundreds of people submit poems to a newspaper contest, when dozens of poetry anthologies are in print, and when a book-length poem sells two hundred thousand copies, a number reached by very few works of prose? What would count for writers like Lerner and Zapruder as a meaningful poem, or a poem that made a difference? It is almost as though a poem that actually communicated something to someone could not be a real poem. There seems to be a disconnect between the practice and the theory. Where did that come from?

Probably it’s as old as writing. What has long been presumed to be the earliest writing, the Sumerian tablets, comprises administrative records. But if people could write down factual stuff they could also write down made-up stuff, and there must have soon developed an account of the difference. That account would have explained how made-up stuff needs to be read differently from factual stuff, why made-up stuff has effects on us that factual stuff does not, and what sort of practical work, if any, fiction might be doing in our lives. “Well, I guess we can leave the sign as is.” This distinction between fiction and nonfiction, whenever it dates from, but certainly, in the West, since Plato, has produced a heap of abstractions, and those abstractions are what I think these writers are getting hung up on. “Fiction” and “nonfiction” are made to operate as oppositely charged magnets attracting incompatible values. Nonfiction is logical; fiction is associative. Nonfiction is literal and truthful, fiction figurative and imaginary. Nonfiction is objective and communicates, but fiction is subjective and expresses. Fiction is supposed to represent not literal truth but a mysterious entity called “emotional truth.” Indeterminacy and obscurity are out of place in nonfiction but acceptable in fiction. In this opposition, poetry sits at the extreme end, the mode of writing least like nonfiction. The consequence is a kind of inside-out justification for poems in which poetry beats nonfiction at its own game by refusing to play it. “He nothing affirms, and therefore never lieth,” Sir Philip Sidney famously wrote of the poet in “ The Defense of Poesie ,” and his is the model formulation. (“I have more just cause to make a pitiful defense of poor Poetry, which from almost the highest estimation of learning, is fallen to be the laughing stock of children,” Sidney began the “Defense.” It was posthumously published in 1595, around the time Shakespeare wrote “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” and the year before Edmund Spenser published a large portion of “The Faerie Queene.” That was a pretty big disconnect.) So Lerner offers conundrums like poetry’s “usefulness depends on its lack of practical utility,” and Zapruder describes a poem as “making meaning by failing to fully make meaning.” With poems, Zapruder says, “we get to a truth that is beyond our ability to articulate when we are attempting to ‘use’ language to convey our ideas or stories.” Poetry isn’t true, in the ordinary sense, but apparently that makes it truthier. Do readers really need these distinctions? Ancient-world readers of Homer must have known how much of the Odyssey was fanciful and how much of it was true, and in what sense. Their notion of what mattered was undoubtedly different from ours, but we, too, can read the Odyssey for what it tells us—about social relations in the Mediterranean gift economy, for example. The distinction between the fictional and the nonfictional is much blurrier in practice than it is in theory. Lerner says that we expect too much from poetry. That’s right, and we expect too much from nonfiction, too. Virtually all writing is parts literal and parts figural, parts “critical” and parts “creative.” And its ability to effect change in people’s personal or political lives has nothing to do with its degree of “fictionality.” One of Lerner’s chief examples of misplaced expectations for poetry is what he calls “nostalgia for a poetry that could supposedly reconcile the individual and the social, and so transform millions of individuals into an authentic People.” He says that this kind of poetry never existed. To which there is a one-word response: Dante. The Divine Comedy is a first-person poem about a man who suffers a crisis (“I found myself in a dark wood, for the straight way was lost”), which he resolves by undertaking an imaginary journey that he pretends has been made possible by the soul of a dead woman he loved. That poem, written in the vernacular in the fourteenth century, is still at the heart of national identity in Italy. As the Iliad and the Odyssey were for ancient Greece, and as the Aeneid was for Rome. Lerner, to be fair, is mainly concerned with lyric poetry (another unstable category: is “The Waste Land” a lyric?). He argues that “there are no good examples of ‘superb lyric poems’ that at once ‘have something to say’ utterly specific to a poet’s ‘experience’ and can speak for all.” “Utterly” and “all” make for a narrow window—nothing is utterly one kind of thing, and no one speaks for all—but, even leaving aside the many lyric poets who, because of their bodies of work, became representative figures for a people or a nation, from Bashō to Yeats and Neruda, and even leaving aside the many lyric poets who were persecuted as threats to the regime, from Ovid to Anna Akhmatova and Joseph Brodsky, there are plenty of lyric poems that are “utterly” personal and yet speak for many. One of the founding documents of African and Caribbean anticolonialism, Aimé Césaire’s “Notebook of a Return to the Native Land,” is a lyric poem. So is Adrienne Rich’s “Diving Into the Wreck,” an inspirational text for the women’s movement. It’s weird to think that these works don’t count. All the poems in the anti-Trump collection “Resistance, Rebellion, Life” are lyrics, and many begin with a story that is utterly personal. Sharon Olds’s “Immigration Anthem” starts with her hip operation and ends on Ellis Island before the golden door: entering through it was a promise to leave it open behind us. Zapruder is more hospitable to poems with political ambitions, and he discusses several, including one of the most controversial poems of the twenty-first century, Amiri Baraka’s “Somebody Blew Up America,” on the attacks of September 11th. Zapruder calls the poem “glorious” and “problematic.” But he thinks that what makes it a poem are the questions it raises and cannot answer, rather than any points it might seek to make. “We find genuine questions everywhere in poetry because they direct the language away from certainty and stasis,” Zapruder explains. “In the best poems, often the poet does not know the answer.” The less confident Baraka is about what he thinks, in other words, the more poetic his poem. “Unlike other forms of writing, poetry takes as its primary task to insist and depend upon and celebrate the troubled relation of the word to what it represents,” Zapruder claims. Some version of this notion—that, whatever the ostensible subject matter, poems are “about” language—has been current in English departments since the days of the New Criticism. Language is a profoundly mysterious technology, so constitutive of the human mind that we can only get glimpses, from inside the fishbowl of consciousness, of how it works. And the study of literary technique is a great way to explore the nature of language. But here is the opening stanza of Frederick Seidel’s poem in “Resistance, Rebellion, Life,” called “Now”: And you could say we’ve been living in clover From Walt Whitman to Barack Obama. Now a dictatorship of vicious spineless slimes We the people voted in has taken over. Once we’d abolished slavery, we lived in clover, From sea to shining sea, even in terrible times. It’s over. “The troubled relation of the word to what it represents” is not what jumps out at me here."
http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trumps-tweeted-transgender-ban-is-not-a-law,newyorker,Trump’s Tweeted Transgender Ban Is Not a Law,[],"A tweet by a President is neither a law nor an executive order. That reality is important to keep in mind when considering President Trump ’s tweet on Wednesday morning, saying that the U.S. government “will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.” Trump’s tweet seemingly banning transgender people from military service has the same legal efficacy as his myriad other tweets expressing desires, promises, and intentions, many of which are unlikely to come to fruition, from building a wall on the Mexican border to changing the libel laws.

Before Trump’s tweet, the Pentagon was implementing a system of rules and regulations that allowed transgender individuals to serve in the military. An estimated two thousand to eleven thousand openly transgender active-duty service members are currently serving in the armed forces, according to a Rand Corporation study . Less than a month ago, the military was supposed to begin allowing new recruits who are transgender to join its ranks. But Defense Secretary James Mattis announced that military leaders would take six more months to study the potential impact of that move. The deferment was disappointing but it was accompanied by an assurance that the outcome of the review was not predetermined. And the delay did not, in any event, contemplate a possible outright ban on transgender individuals serving in the military.

At the same time, Congress has been debating the funding of medical treatment related to gender transition for military personnel. The Rand study estimated that the move would increase military health-care costs by between $2.4 million and $8.4 million a year, a 0.04 to 0.13 per cent increase in over-all Pentagon spending.

Trump seems to have taken military leaders by surprise on Wednesday by suddenly announcing, via tweet, a full transgender military ban. The Times reported that Mattis was on vacation and, according to people close to him, he was “appalled that Mr. Trump chose to unveil his decision in tweets, in part because of the message they sent to transgender active-duty service members, including those deployed overseas, that they were suddenly no longer welcome.”

There also appears to have been no directive from the Defense Department on which Trump based his blanket announcement, which would be remarkable in any normal Administration. The Times said it asked eight Defense Department officials how the ban would be carried out and how it would affect openly transgender active-duty members. None of the officials could give a definitive answer.

Ironically, Trump’s tweets came on the sixty-ninth anniversary of the executive order issued by President Harry Truman that desegregated the American military . Over the objections of many white officers, Truman signed Executive Order 9981, on July 26, 1948, which stated, “It is hereby declared to be the policy of the President that there shall be equality of treatment and opportunity for all persons in the armed services without regard to race, color, religion, or national origin.” Truman’s order began a decades-long, and still imperfect, effort by the military to turn itself into one of the most integrated institutions in American society.

It remains to be seen whether the Pentagon will actually adopt the transgender ban referred to in Trump’s tweet. If it does, the tendency of Trump and his aides to make public comments that turn out to be helpful to their opponents in legal battles could complicate implementation of the ban. After Trump tweeted his ban, an unnamed Administration official told Jonathan Swan of Axios that “this forces Democrats in Rust Belt states like Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin to take complete ownership of this issue. How will the blue-collar voters in these states respond when Senators up for re-election in 2018 like Debbie Stabenow are forced to make their opposition to this a key plank of their campaigns?” Statements like these could create significant problems for the Administration’s lawyers tasked with defending the lawsuits to come.

A basic and long-standing legal principle is that government actions must have a “rational basis,” which is the lowest level of Constitutional scrutiny. Basing a government policy on an urgent need to win midterm elections would not satisfy such a requirement. It is debasing that we spend so much energy in reaction to a President whose erratic, hundred-and-forty-character statements, unfortunately, often seem to embody no rational basis at all."

It is similar to all the previous Very Illegal Things, but somehow Even Worse. No former President has committed anything like this, let alone within the first term of the Presidency.

This Illegal Action threatens our national security, as well as our relationships with our allies, and will most likely result in nuclear warfare. According to the Constitution, which Trump has “totally read, of course, obviously,” the Commander-in-Chief is not allowed to perform the act that Trump actually performed just now, in the fifteen minutes before his next round of golf. It has been five months since President Trump, who at one point wanted to impress Billy Bush on a bus, took office.

The latest Illegal Action, along with everything else the man has done, provides us with new reasons to suspect that Trump has, yet again, been scheming with the Russians. One of the most compelling pieces of evidence is that Trump was caught openly scheming with the Russians. We are waiting for more reasons to officially declare whether Trump was ever scheming with the Russians.

Jared Kushner has argued that what his father-in-law did was perfectly legal, and that he endorses it, leading many to suspect that Kushner may also be in on the scandal. Kushner is best known for getting his job via nepotism and being a white man.

The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Paul Ryan, declined to comment. The House Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy, declined to comment. The Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, declined to comment. Chris Christie also declined to comment, which was weird, because we hadn’t reached out to him in the first place. Ben Carson did comment, but we couldn’t transcribe his words because they were unintelligible and, let’s be honest, probably irrelevant.

Our only on-the-record comment came from the Commander-in-Chief himself, via Twitter. It read, “I would never do Illegal Thing, despite all the evidence that I did do Illegal Thing.” This statement was officially released after four failed attempts to spell “evidence.”

In closing, our opinion is that this New Illegal Thing is what will finally bring down Trump. It must be the final straw after, to review, he has already been accused of:

Sexually assaulting multiple women.

Continuing to engage in corrupt business dealings around the world.

Firing the F.B.I. director, James Comey, for investigating Trump’s ties to Russia.

Sharing classified information with the Russian Ambassador and foreign minister.

Trying to eliminate the health-care system.

Building a campaign on racism, Islamophobia, and sexism.

Like, all those things should have really done it by now, right?

How is that not enough??

HOW MUCH WORSE DOES HE NEED TO GET?!

DO WE NEED TO RELEASE THE PEE TAPES?!

HAVE WE GONE INSANE?! WHAT IS HAPPENING?! HE DOESN'T EVEN WANT THIS JOB!! DO YOU KNOW HOW DUMB OUR ARTICLES LIKE “MUST-TRY UNDER-THE-RADAR RAMEN RESTAURANTS IN PORTLAND” LOOK RIGHT NOW?? CAN WE NOT CATCH ONE BREAK?? DON’T YOU WANT TO CARE ABOUT RESTAURANTS AGAIN???

All right, well, it looks like this Illegal Thing is just going to be another cute tile. Can’t wait for the next one that will inevitably happen in, like, two hours."
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/06/05/the-countess-private-secretary,newyorker,The Countess’s Private Secretary,"['Ellis Rosen', 'Nicole Holofcener', 'Justin Torres']","One February day in 1988, I emerged from the subway on Lexington Avenue to find that East Sixty-eighth Street, where I’d recently begun working as a private secretary to a countess, was overrun by fire trucks and acrid with the stench of smoke. “The street is closed,” a fireman told me, as I tried to enter the block. Then, among the retracting ladders and dripping cornices, I noticed a head thrust from the window of a grand prewar apartment house. A guttural voice reached the fireman and me: “Let her through! That’s my secretary!”

I was twenty-five, and had moved to New York the previous fall in the hope of becoming a writer. By the time I found my way to the countess, I had already cycled through enough temporary jobs to know how lucky I was to land part-time work that kept me in frozen yogurt and paid the rent on my fifth-floor studio walkup.

Being a private secretary to the countess meant, in some sense, becoming her. At 1 P.M. each weekday, I lost track of my own life when I stepped into her tiny marble foyer, its table laden with embossed invitations from displaced European royalty. The foyer opened onto a living room, a dining room, and a parlor with sponge-marbled walls and tables smothered with brocade and studded with curios. Through a narrow door, the finery gave way abruptly to a rudimentary kitchen and a wisp of a bedroom, hardly large enough to hold the twin bed where the countess slept. She was newly widowed, an American-born writer of what she charmingly called “faction”: embellished tales of her experiences as an agent for the O.S.S. during the Second World War and, later, for the C.I.A. A striking beauty with an earthy, straightforward manner, she had married a Spanish count and spent most of her adulthood in Spain, numbering among her friends the Baron Guy de Rothschild, Salvador Dali, the Duchess of Windsor, and Jacqueline Onassis.

Becoming the countess was not as difficult for me as you might think. Both of us were tall and slender, raised as Catholics, and febrile with nervous energy (in her mid-sixties, she attended a daily ninety-minute aerobics class). Years of living as a grandee had encouraged in the countess an imperious short-temperedness that I recognized, chillingly, as evidence of a volcanic impatience, which we also shared. My handwriting resembled hers, and this helped me to forge her signature in copies of her first book—a surprise best-seller that had brought her fame and a hefty contract for two more volumes. I answered her fan mail, carrying on prolonged correspondences in her name—and, I liked to think, her voice. I handwrote invitations to the small dinners she held at her apartment and tallied replies from other private secretaries whose telephone voices I came to recognize. Most thrilling were my occasional private encounters with eminences she knew: delivering a book to Lady (Slim) Keith, grouchy and bedridden by then; telephoning Harold Brodkey (whom the countess thought handsome and once invited to dinner) and having him answer breathlessly, with no idea who was calling, “Is it you?”

On the day of the fire, the countess had planned a dinner in honor of Nancy Reagan, then the First Lady and a close friend. Several others in their circle, including Mike Wallace, Malcolm Forbes, and Betsy Bloomingdale, were expected. The fire, although it had been in the basement, had left the whole building without power. The countess’s walls and upholstery reeked of smoke, and opening the windows only filled the rooms with chilly wind. Some hostesses might have cancelled a dinner party under such conditions, but not the countess. I spent several hours trying to vanquish obstacles and reassure the Secret Service, whose agents telephoned with rising concern. I called the office of Donald Trump, another guest, to inquire about borrowing a generator.

Although the countess told me often how much she liked and admired me, I was unmistakably a servant. In this I resembled Fernando, one in a series of butlers she brought from Spain to serve her meals, his grave, mustachioed face worthy of a painting by Velázquez. And, like Fernando, I was subject to the countess’s lacerating critiques. Garlic, which I loved, was “low class” and, according to her, oozed from my pores for days after I ate it. The “miserable” bouquet of flowers I bought for one of her house guests with the small funds she’d given me for the purchase provoked a paroxysm of rage that left me in tears. My cowboy boots were coarse; I hid my figure in unflattering clothes. My spelling was atrocious. And so on. I had a morbid dread of her anger, but my willingness to absorb it was essential to our symbiosis.

I’ve forgotten how the countess persuaded the Secret Service that her building was safe for the First Lady to dine in. I’ve forgotten how the dinner was cooked. I know that it was served by candlelight, which created a singular intimacy. A near-disaster involving an errant flame and a feathered cuff only added a frisson to the evening.

I witnessed none of this. To the countess’s ire and bafflement, I refused her request that I stay through the evening to help with coats and the dinner service, citing unbreakable plans. Now, almost thirty years later, I’m more incensed than she was: what, in my rudimentary life, could have been more interesting than the spectacle of that dinner party? I can’t recall. All I remember is my visceral wish to escape—a feeling I had often during my more than two years as her private secretary, until an N.E.A. grant finally allowed me to quit. Before the guests began to make their tentative way up the countess’s dank service stairs, I slipped out in my worn cowboy boots and resumed being myself. ♦"
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1966/01/22/among-the-wild-things,newyorker,Maurice Sendak’s Wild Things,[],"As I studied the pictures of Max and his companions, it seemed to me that I had never seen fantasy depicted in American children’s books in illustrations that were so powerfully in motion. Brian O’Doherty, the former art critic of the Times , has written that Sendak is “a fantasist in the great tradition of Sir John Tenniel and Edward Lear,” and I agree. O’Doherty has also described Sendak as “one of the most powerful men in the United States,” in that he “has given shape to the fantasies of millions of children—an awful responsibility.” I had known a few men who possessed power, but never this kind of power, so I made arrangements to meet the creator of the wild things.

In the past few years, I have become increasingly interested in Sendak’s work, reading his books for my own pleasure as well as for the amusement of my children. His drawings, I have found, are oddly compelling. Intensely, almost palpably alive, they seem to move on the page and, later, in memory. This quality is pervasive in “Where the Wild Things Are,” the story of a boy named Max who assumes a demonic face and puts on a wolf suit one night and makes mischief. His mother calls him a “ WILD THInG !” and Max answers, “ I’LL EAT YOU UP !” He is sent to bed without his supper. Standing in his room, Max watches a forest grow until it becomes the world. An ocean tumbles by with a boat in it for Max, and he sails to where the wild things are. The wild things—a colony of monsters—try to frighten Max, but, frowning fiercely, he commands them to be still. Cowed, they make Max King of the Wild Things. Then, at Max’s order, a rumpus begins—six wordless pages of howling, dancing, tree-climbing, and parading by Max and the wild things. Max presently stops the revels, though, and sends the wild things to bed without their supper, and then, feeling lonely, gives up his crown. The wild things so hate to see Max leave that they try to scare him into staying, but he is not intimidated, and he sails back to his room, where he finds his supper waiting for him.

Sendak has trouble believing in his commercial success largely because his creations are so much at variance with the sort of thing that usually sells well in his field. Far too many contemporary picture books for the young are still populated by children who eat everything on their plates, go dutifully to bed at the proper hour, and learn all sorts of useful facts or moral lessons by the time the book comes to an end. The illustrations are usually decorative rather than imaginative, and any fantasy that may be encountered either corresponds to the fulfillment of adult wishes or is carefully curbed lest it frighten the child. Many of these books, homogenized and characterless, look and read as if they had been put together by a computer. Sendak’s work, on the other hand, is unmistakably identifiable as his. He will not illustrate to order, increasingly depending on himself as the writer, and, when he illustrates the texts of others, choosing only those that seem real to him. “Maurice is not an artist who just does an occasional book for children because there’s money in it or because he thinks it will give him an easy change of pace,” Sendak’s editor, Ursula Nordstrom, who is director of the children’s book department of Harper & Row, has said. “Children’s books are all he does and all he wants to do. His books are full of emotion, of vitality. When one of his lines for a drawing is blown up, you find that it’s not a precise straight line. It’s rough with ridges, because so much emotion has gone into it. Too many of us—and I mean editors along with illustrators and writers of children’s books—are afraid of emotion. We keep forgetting that children are new and we are not. But somehow Maurice has retained a direct line to his own childhood.” Sendak, moreover, does not subscribe to the credo that childhood is a time of innocence—a point of view that, as it is usually interpreted, results in tales and pictures soothing to parents but unreal to the children. The young in Sendak’s books—particularly the books he writes himself—are sometimes troubled and lonely, they slip easily into and out of fantasies, and occasionally they are unruly and stubborn. Nor are they the bright, handsome boys and softly pretty little girls who are so numerous in so many picture books for children. The Sendak boys and girls tend to appear truncated, having oversized heads, short arms, and quite short legs.

My son’s familiarity with Maurice Sendak’s creations is shared by a sizable and constantly growing number of American children under eight. As a writer, as an illustrator, and as both, Sendak has been associated with a number of successful children’s books of the past decade. In addition to the “Little Bear” series, the “Nutshell Library,” and “Where the Wild Things Are,” there have been “A Hole Is to Dig,” written by Ruth Krauss, “The BatPoet” and “The Animal Family,” both written by the late Randall Jarrell, “Lullabies and Night Songs,” with music by Alec Wilder, and “Hector Protector.” More than fifty other children’s books contain illustrations by Sendak, and more than half a dozen have texts by him; many of them sell well enough to keep Sendak surprised by his affluence.

“Pierre!” Nicholas announced. The next jump was the most ambitious yet, and Nicholas fell off the bed. As he rubbed his knee, my wife asked, “Are you hurt?” In a much softer voice, he replied, “Yes, Mother Bear.” Mother Bear is a large, comfortable source of reassurance in “Little Bear,” a series of four books written by Else Holmelund Minarik and illustrated by Maurice Sendak. The Pierre whom Nicholas had been emulating is the hero of a book called “Pierre,” which is part of the four-volume “Nutshell Library,” written and illustrated by Maurice Sendak; Pierre, even after he is swallowed by a famished lion, will say only “I don’t care.” On top of a chest of drawers next to Nicholas’s bed is a large picture of a dancing creature with horns, sharp teeth, yellow eyes, and a scaly body. He is a wild thing—an inhabitant of “Where the Wild Things Are,” a book written and illustrated by Maurice Sendak. Some reviewers of children’s books have asserted that the wild things are frightening, but Nicholas finds them quite funny.

I looked puzzled, and Sendak smiled. “You see, I don’t believe, in a way, that the kid I was grew up into me,” he said. “He still exists somewhere, in the most graphic, plastic, physical way. It’s as if he had moved somewhere. I have a tremendous concern for him and interest in him. I communicate with him—or try to—all the time. One of my worst fears is losing contact with him.” Sendak frowned. “I don’t want this to sound coy or schizophrenic, but at least once a day I feel I have to make contact,” he went on. “The pleasures I get as an adult are heightened by the fact that I experience them as a child at the same time. Like, when autumn comes, as an adult I welcome the departure of the heat, and simultaneously, as a child would, I start anticipating the snow and the first day it will be possible to use a sled. This dual apperception does break down occasionally. That usually happens when my work is going badly. I get a sour feeling about books in general and my own in particular. The next stage is annoyance at my dependence on this dual apperception, and I reject it. Then I become depressed. When excitement about what I’m working on returns, so does the child. We’re on happy terms again. Being in that kind of contact with my childhood is vital to me, but it doesn’t make me perfectly certain I know what I’m doing in my work. Especially in books for children under six. I don’t think anyone really knows what kids that young like and what they don’t like. They’re formless, fluid creatures—like moving water. You can’t stop one of them at any one point and know exactly what’s going on. A child may react strongly to a book because it reaches him emotionally in some way the author intended. Then, again, it may be that he once saw a duck from a train window and never saw one again until he looked at the book, and though the book is rotten, he loves it because there’s a duck in it. Once in a while I encounter reactions to one of my books that make me think I may be getting some idea of what happened. From letters and from talking to parents and librarians, I’ve found out that, of the four books in the Nutshell Library, ‘Pierre’ is invariably the favorite with children. But here, too, I don’t know what level the child is reacting on. On one level, ‘Pierre’ is slapstick. Then, the text has a rhythmic quality—the repetition that kids like—and some children may be drawn mainly by that. On another level, Pierre is defiant—irrationally so, when it comes to the lion that finally eats him—and the child may enjoy a surface identification with the fun of rebellion. And, on a deeper level, Pierre is saying, ‘I’m me . I’ll be what I am and I’ll do what I want to do.’ The book that children have reacted to most strongly, though, is ‘Where the Wild Things Are.’ They wear out copies at libraries and keep rereading it at home. Some have sent me drawings of their own wild things, and they make mine look like cuddly fuzzballs. My wild things have big teeth. Some of their wild things not only have big teeth but are chewing on children. I have yet to hear of a child who was frightened by the book. Adults who are troubled by it forget that Max is having a fine time. He’s in control. And by getting his anger at his mother discharged against the wild things he’s able to come back to the real world at peace with himself. I think Max is my truest creation. Like all kids, he believes in a world where a child can skip from fantasy to reality in the conviction that both exist. One seven-year-old boy wrote me a letter.” Sendak rose, rummaged through a file folder in the bookcase, found the letter, and handed it to me. The boy had written, “How much does it cost to get to where the wild things are? If it is not too expensive my sister and I want to spend the summer there. Please answer soon.”

A Sealyham terrier came in. This, I was told, was Jennie, who was twelve years old and had a tendency to brood. Jennie has appeared in most of Sendak’s books, often looking more cheerful than she does in real life. Having sniffed at me briefly, Jennie left. Sendak lit a cigarette. As I looked at him, I found that he reminded me of the children in his books, and I told him so. “Yes, they’re all a kind of caricature of me,” he said. “They look as if they’d been hit on the head, and hit so hard they weren’t going to grow anymore. When I first started showing my work to children’s-book editors, about seventeen years ago, they didn’t encourage me, and a major reason was the kind of children I drew. One editor, I remember, told me they were too European. What she meant was that they seemed ugly to her. And even now I’ll get a letter at least twice a year from a librarian who wants to know why my children are so drab. Well, they’re not drab, but they’re not innocent of experience, either. Too many parents and too many writers of children’s books don’t respect the fact that kids know a great deal and suffer a great deal. My children also show a great deal of pleasure, but often they look defenseless, too. Being defenseless is a primary element of childhood. It’s not that I don’t see the naturalistic beauty of a child. I’m very aware of that beauty, and I could draw it. I know the proportions of a child’s body. But I am trying to draw the way children feel —or, rather, the way I imagine they feel. It’s the way I know I felt as a child.” Sendak leaned forward, and continued, “It may be that in projecting how I felt as a child onto the children I draw I’m being terribly biassed and inaccurate. But all I have to go on is what I know—not only about my childhood then but about the child I was as he exists now.”

The first day I visited his studio, Sendak, a short, shy man with dark-brown hair and green eyes, smiled after he saw me staring intently at the picture. “It’s hard to get away from her, isn’t it?” he said. “If you stay here long enough, you’ll find that her eyes follow you around the room.” He moved in front of the photograph. “Her face is unfinished—a round, beautiful child’s face—but her eyes tell you she could be forty-five years old. Such knowledge and pain are already there. I couldn’t do without her.”

Sendak, a bachelor, lives in a duplex on Ninth Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. On the street level he has a bedroom and a large living room with a piano and a profusion of bookcases, one of them reserved for first editions (he has close to two hundred) of works by Henry James. On the floor below are a spacious kitchen, a dining room with a brick fireplace, and a small studio, lit only by the lamp over Sendak’s drawing board, which is to the left of the room’s entrance. On the walls of the studio are paintings, photographs, and posters advertising art exhibits. A bookcase near the studio door contains an extensive collection of children’s books, formed largely around Sendak’s favorite illustrators: Randolph Caldecott and George Cruikshank, of nineteenth-century England; Ludwig Richter and Wilhelm Busch, of the same period in Germany; A. B. Frost and Edward Windsor Kemble, Americans who between them spanned the last half of the nineteenth century and the first three decades of this one; Ernst Kreidolf, a Swiss artist of those years; and, among contemporaries, the late Hans Fischer of Switzerland and André François of France. To the right of Sendak’s drawing board is a worktable, and above this is a pegboard supporting a swarm of objects. Among them are talismans—a brontosaurus constructed for him by a nephew, for instance—and postcard reproductions of paintings by Watteau, Goya, William Blake, and Winslow Homer; there are also a number of toys that Sendak has brought back from Europe, where he goes about every other year. Across the room from the worktable, an imposing high-fidelity unit stands on top of another bookcase, this one containing a large record collection, in which works by Mahler, Mozart, Beethoven, Wolf, Wagner, and Verdi are heavily represented. What dominates the room, however, is a huge photograph. Taken at an orphanage in Sicily, it shows a ten-year-old girl standing sidewise in front of a whitewashed wall. She is wearing a ragged white dress, a fly has alighted on her back, and she looks out into the room with enormous black eyes. Her hand is on her hip—a pose that is frequently assumed by the children in Sendak’s books.

Fantasy, I learned in subsequent visits to the studio, has been familiar terrain to Sendak from his earliest years. He was born in Brooklyn on June 10, 1928, the youngest of three children of Philip and Sarah Sendak. (His sister, Natalie, was eight when he was born, and his brother, Jack, was five.) Both parents had come to America before the First World War from Jewish shtetls , or small towns, outside Warsaw. The father, who worked in the garment district, told his children long stories based on tales he remembered from his childhood and alive with myth and fantasy. “He was a marvellous improviser, and he’d often extend a story for many nights,” Sendak recalls. “One short one I’ve always wanted to make into a book was about a child taking a walk with his father and mother. He becomes separated from them. Snow begins to fall, and the child shivers in the cold. He huddles under a tree, sobbing in terror. An enormous figure hovers over him and says, as he draws the boy up, ‘I’m Abraham, your father.’ His fear gone, the child looks up and also sees Sarah. He is no longer lost. When his parents find him, the child is dead. Those stories had something of the character of William Blake’s poems. The myths in them didn’t seem at all factitious. And they fused Jewish lore with my father’s particular way of shaping memory and desire. That one, for instance, was based on the power of Abraham in Jewish tradition as the father who was always there—a reassuring father even when he was Death. But the story was also about how tremendously my father missed his parents. Not all his tales were sombre, though. My father could be very witty, even if the humor was always on the darker side of irony.”

In addition to the tales his father told, and occasional stories told by his mother, books, to which Sendak early formed a passionate attachment, also stimulated his imagination. His sister gave him his first books—“The Prince and the Pauper” and “The Three Musketeers.” Besides being fascinated by the contents of the books, he was drawn to them as physical entities. “I can still remember the smell and feel of the bindings of those first two books,” he says. “I didn’t read them for a long time. It felt so good just having them. They seemed alive to me, and so did many other inanimate objects I was fond of. All children have these intense feelings about certain dolls or other toys. In my case, this kind of relationship, if you can call it that, was heightened because up to the age of six I spent a lot of time in bed with a series of illnesses. Being alone much of the time, I developed friendships with objects. To this day, in my parents’ home there are certain toys that I played with as a child, and when I visit my parents, I’m also visiting those toys.”

In “Kenny’s Window,” which was published in 1956, and was the first book that Sendak wrote as well as illustrated, he distilled much of his own childhood—the attachment to particular objects, the fantasy, the loneliness. Kenny wakes from a dream and remembers meeting in a garden a rooster, who gave him seven questions to answer. In the course of searching for the answers, he has serious conversations with several of his toys. Kenny is angered by a favorite Teddy bear, who reproaches him for having been left under the bed all night, but soon Kenny writes the bear a poem assuring him of his love, and that conflict is resolved. In fantasy, Kenny journeys to Switzerland and talks with a goat in order to find the answer to one of the rooster’s questions: “What is an only goat?” An only goat, Kenny finally learns, is a lonely goat who is not allowed by an overprotective master to do what he most enjoys doing. There is also a meeting, on the roof of Kenny’s house, with a talking, flying horse. Kenny resolves not to tell his parents about the horse and its ability to talk and to fly. (“They’d say it was a dream. They don’t know how to listen in the night.”) Another crisis occurs when one of Kenny’s two favorite lead soldiers reminds the other of a promise Kenny has broken—to take care of them always. The first soldier is chipped in four different places. He complains to Kenny. Enraged at being made to feel guilty, Kenny exiles the chipped soldier to the outside ledge of his window in the cold, but then he brings the soldier in again and tells him he has not broken his promise. When the rooster later asks Kenny one of the seven questions again—“Can you fix a broken promise?”—Kenny answers, “Yes, if it only looks broken, but really isn’t.”

In his adult life, Sendak’s rapport with particular inanimate objects has not been limited to the toys in Brooklyn. One afternoon, in his studio, he pointed out to me several pens on his drawing board, and said, “Some of these pens are with me, and some are against me. In a store, some look as if they want to be sold to me. Others will fight me to the end. I may antagonize some and not be able to win back their friendship, but others are less stubborn.” He picked up a small, smooth rock. “This is a friend,” he said. “I found him on a beach in Italy in 1953. He goes with me on all my trips.” Sendak looked at me somewhat warily, and added, “I suppose that sounds strange.” Since I have similar feelings about an old lighter and three pipes, I was able to tell him it didn’t.

Sendak did have other friends besides objects as he grew up. He had a close relationship with his brother Jack. Both boys enjoyed drawing, and one of their amusements was making books. These combined cut-out newspaper photographs and comic strips with sketches of the Sendak family. The books were bound with tape, had elaborately illustrated covers, and contained a good deal of painstaking hand lettering.

“I was always conscious of usable material for books,” Sendak recalls. “I remember examining my grandmother all the time and placing her in various fantasies. And I was so conscious of the streets on which I lived that I can remember them now in complete detail—how many houses there were, who lived in which house, what the people looked like. During my early teens, I spent a lot of time at the window, sketching the kids at play, and those sketchbooks are, in a sense, the foundation of much of my later work. Maybe that’s another reason the children in my books are called European-looking. Many of them resemble the kids I knew growing up in Brooklyn. They were Jewish kids, and they may well look like little greenhorns just off the boat. They had—some of them, anyway—a kind of bowed look, as if the burdens of the world were on their shoulders.”

“The Sign on Rosie’s Door,” a Sendak book published in 1960, begins with the dedication:

Remembering Pearl Karchawer _ all the Rosies_ _ and Brooklyn._

Rosie is a girl with an unusually lively imagination, and she gets her friends—who do indeed look like Jewish children on the streets of Brooklyn—to take part in her fantasies. At one point, Rosie, sitting on a cellar door and covered from head to foot in a red blanket, identifies herself as “Alinda the lost girl.” “Who lost you?” asks a neighborhood literalist. “I lost myself,” Rosie answers. Like the fantasies in “Kenny’s Window” and a number of Sendak’s other stories, Rosie’s often involve highly active play. She announces that her “Magic Man” is coming, and all the children close their eyes, because he will not appear otherwise. They hear her speak to him, and when they are allowed to open their eyes again, Rosie tells them that the Magic Man has informed her that they can all be firecrackers. Rosie and her friends proceed to leap and dance through several pages.

When the teen-age Sendak wasn’t making books, he was reading other people’s. Though some were stories for children, his reading was indiscriminate. His sister subscribed to the Book-of-the-Month Club, and he read many of the volumes she received. “Now I can’t remember any children’s books or artists that profoundly influenced me in those years except Walt Disney,” he says. “I now say it to my shame, yet he did something tremendous for me. His pictures did move, and they often embodied lots of fantasy. With whatever money I had, I’d buy his coloring and cutout books, and I made animated sequences of my own based on his characters. And when I saw Disney’s ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’ at the Radio City Music Hall, I had an inkling of what it was I especially wanted to do. It was only later that I could see how Disney had despoiled beautiful stories and had abused the idea of animation. Kids don’t always know about the vulgar and tasteless, and to me Disney was a god. I remember a Mickey Mouse mask that came on a big box of cornflakes. What a fantastic mask! Such a big, bright, vivid, gorgeous hunk of face! My ambition was to work for Disney.”

Sendak graduated from Lafayette High School, in Brooklyn, in 1946. “I was an art major in high school, but we had no real instruction—I just sat and did what I wanted to,” he says. After school and weekends, he had worked for All American Comics, his job being to adapt “Mutt and Jeff” strips for comic books, fitting them into the page, filling in backgrounds, and extending the story line when necessary. He enjoyed this work, but school, by contrast, was a place of acute discomfort. “Nearly every morning, in order to get there, I had to talk myself out of a state of panic, he says. “I couldn’t stand being cloistered with other children, and I was usually so embarrassed that I stammered.”

After graduation, he went to work full time at Timely Service, a window-display house in lower Manhattan, beginning in a warehouse, where he helped construct store-window models of such figures as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs out of chicken wire, papier-mâché, spun glass, plaster, and paint. “It was one of the best times of my life,” Sendak says. “I was in Manhattan, and, for the first time, I knew people who were artists, who considered their work for Timely Service just a job to enable them to do real painting at night in their cold-water flats. There were all kinds of people I’d never met in Brooklyn.” When he had been at Timely Service for nearly two years, he was promoted to the department that conceived the window-display designs to be built in the warehouse. There he was unhappy. “The department consisted of another kind of artist—people in their fifties who had never got anywhere,” he recalls. Sendak left the display house in the summer of 1948, and during the next two months, at home in Brooklyn, he and his brother constructed six intricate animated wooden toys, performing scenes from “Little Red Riding Hood,” “Little Miss Muffet,” “Hansel and Gretel,” “Aladdin’s Lamp,” “Old Mother Hubbard,” and “Pinocchio.” The pieces, five of which Sendak now has in his studio, are in the tradition of eighteenth-century German lever-operated toys. When a lever on Little Red Riding Hood’s basket is pulled, for instance, a ferocious wolf leaps out of bed and Little Red Riding Hood collapses. The Sendak brothers took their toys to F. A. O. Schwarz. Their work was received with respect, but an official at the store pointed out that it would be too costly to reproduce the toys in large quantities. “Nor were we ready to compromise, if a compromise had been suggested,” Sendak says. “We wanted a workshop of little old men creating the little wooden parts, and we would not have permitted any kind of plastic substitute.” Ultimately, though, Richard Nell, Schwarz’s window-display director, was sufficiently impressed by the way in which Maurice Sendak had painted the toys to hire him as an assistant in the construction of window displays. (His brother, meanwhile, although he went on to work in the electronics field, has also written several children’s books, two of which Maurice has illustrated.)

Sendak worked at the toy store for three years, and attended evening classes at the Art Students League during most of that time. “It was the only kind of school I could endure, because it was freewheeling,” he says. “What you learned depended on what you wanted to learn.” Sendak took classes in life drawing, oil painting, and composition, and feels that he benefited particularly from the instruction in composition he was given by the illustrator John Groth. “He was important for me because he gave me a sense of the enormous potential for motion, for aliveness, in illustrations,” Sendak recalls. “And he himself was so deeply committed to the field that he showed how much fun creating in it could be.”

At F. A. O. Schwarz, Frances Chrystie, the store’s book buyer, who was a friend of Sendak’s, knew that he was eager to try illustrating children’s books, but when she suggested introducing him to Miss Nordstrom—partly because Harper’s was the publisher whose children’s books he most admired—he demurred, out of shyness. Miss Chrystie thereupon arranged for Miss Nordstrom to “happen by” one day, in the spring of 1950, when Sendak had tacked up a broad variety of his pictures on the walls of the store’s studio. The next day, Miss Nordstrom called Sendak and offered him the opportunity to illustrate Marcel Aymé’s “The Wonderful Farm.” He accepted, and the book was published in 1951. This was not the first time Sendak’s work had been published; in 1947 he had done diagrams and spot drawings for “Atomics for the Millions,” written by Hyman Ruchlis, one of his high-school teachers, and three years later he had illustrated a book about the Sabbath, “Good Shabos, Everybody,” for the United Synagogue Commission on Jewish Education, but “The Wonderful Farm” was the first real children’s book he had worked on. “It made me an official person,” Sendak now says.

In 1952, Sendak became widely known in the children’s-book field as the illustrator of Ruth Krauss’s “A Hole Is to Dig.” The book was quite unconventional for its time. It had no story. Instead, Miss Krauss, by talking with and listening to children, had assembled a series of children’s definitions, among them “A face is so you can make faces,” “Buttons are to keep people warm,” “A whistle is to make people jump,” and—a particular favorite with the book’s readers—“A tablespoon is to eat a table with.” The general idea of “A Hole Is to Dig” has since been repeated many times, often coyly. But Sendak’s small people, seen at play among themselves, sticking out their tongues, closing their eyes in anticipation of being kissed by their dogs’ tongues, wiggling their toes, and sliding delightedly in the mud, never seem saccharine.

An established illustrator had originally been considered for the assignment, but when he was shown simply a collection of definitions, he felt that there was no book in them at all. From the start, however, Sendak was enthusiastic about the book’s possibilities. “It was like being part of a revolution,” he says. “This was the first time in modern children’s-book history that a book had come directly from kids. The notion was so startling to some academics, in fact, that the book was included in a course at Columbia on the uses of language. And, you know, some of those definitions have become part of the language. Working on that book, I learned something else, too. When it seemed to me to be all done, Ruth Krauss pointed out that I was giving the kids who would read the book middle-class attitudes toward their roles. I had the boys doing what boys were expected to do and girls doing what they were expected to do. God forbid a boy should be jumping rope! Of course, that isn’t the way it is, and at the last minute I made some quick changes.”

“A Hole Is to Dig” prepared the way for such later works by others as “A Friend Is Someone Who Likes You,” “Love Is a Special Way of Feeling,” and “Happiness Is a Warm Puppy,” and it was influential in other ways, too. Its format was small, and its success brought back what Sendak identifies as “the little book,” adding, “And, God help us, it hasn’t stopped.” The book was printed on brown-tinted paper, and for the illustrations Sendak had deliberately used his most “old-fashioned” style, his pen-and-ink drawings including a considerable amount of crosshatching, in the tradition of nineteenth-century German and British illustrators.

The success of “A Hole Is to Dig” was such that Sendak was able to leave F. A. O. Schwarz, move to Manhattan, and become a freelance illustrator. Assignments poured in, from Miss Nordstrom and from editors at other publishing houses, and in the years that followed Sendak illustrated the work of various writers. There have been seven more books by Ruth Krauss, and seven books for older children by the Dutch-born writer Meindert Dejong, and Sendak has also had the privilege of collaborating posthumously with Tolstoy (“Nikolenka’s Childhood”), the German Clemens Brentano (“The Tale of Gockel, Hinkel & Gackeliah” and “Schoolmaster Whackwell’s Wonderful Sons”), the German Wilhelm Hauff (“Dwarf Long-Nose”), and the American Frank Stockton (“The Bee-Man of Orn” and “The Griffin and the Minor Canon”). In a preface to “The Griffin and the Minor Canon,” Sendak describes his basic aim as an illustrator: “I wanted at all costs to avoid the serious pitfall of illustrating with pictures what the author had already . . . illustrated with words. I hoped, rather, to let the story speak for itself, with my pictures as a kind of background music—music in the right style and always in tune with the words.”

Sendak elaborated on the degree to which he conceives his work musically in an article called “The Shape of Music,” which appeared in the Sunday Herald Tribune late in 1964. “The spontaneous breaking into song and dance seems so natural and instinctive a part of childhood,” he wrote. “It is perhaps the medium through which children best express the inexpressible; fantasy and feeling lie deeper than words—beyond the words yet available to a child—and both demand a more profound, more biological expression, the primitive expression of music.” Sendak is convinced that children will respond most spontaneously to illustrations that, in his words, “have a sense of music and dance and are not something just glued onto the page.”

In the work of the illustrators that Sendak most admires, he invariably finds a musical quality that he terms “authentic liveliness.” He points to the linear arabesques in the lamb’s dance of death in Boutet de Monvel’s drawings for La Fontaine’s “Fables Choisies pour les Enfants,” and to the same artist’s “harmonic inventions” achieved by the subtle use of color and line. In the work of Randolph Caldecott, Sendak is fascinated not only by the abundance of actual dancing, singing, and playing of instruments but also by the many ways in which Caldecott used the theme-and-variations technique, combining simple themes into what Sendak describes as “a fantastically various interplay of images.”

When Sendak is at work, he not only thinks in musical terms but often has music playing. He begins by trying to find the composer and the piece of music that fit the mood and tone of the story on his drawing board, and he may listen to many recordings before he hits on the right musical colors. “Books, too, can be evocative for me when I’m working on a series of illustrations,” he says. “I often turn to James, Stendhal, D. H. Lawrence, and Melville—especially James, with his acute sensitivity to what happens inside someone growing. But it is music that does most to open me up. That’s why I have all these records—and I go to quite a lot of concerts, too. The other night, for example, I was sitting here listening to ‘Die Meistersinger,’ which I know by heart, and got excited about it all over again. What struck me this time was that Wagner, in some mysterious way, had made the atmosphere—the very night air—of Nuremberg into music. I could see the city and smell it. And that’s the kind of thing I want to convey in my illustrations. The pictures should he so organically akin to the text, so reflective of its atmosphere, that they look as if they could have been done in no other way. They should help create the special world of the story. When this kind of drawing works, I feel like a magician, because I’m creating the air for a writer.”

In illustrating stories of his own, Sendak sometimes encounters an odd difficulty in performing this magic. “I find myself writing things that I don’t like to draw, as if I were two separate people,” he explains. “As a writer, I may, for instance, ask the illustrator part of me to draw too many specific details of a room or of clothes. As an illustrator, I most enjoy interpreting emotions. In ‘Where the Wild Things Are,’ those two selves fused, in that the illustrations were a complete imaginative backdrop to the feelings experienced in the course of fantasy. Being dreamlike and fluid, the scenes aren’t hung up with the kind of particulars that are involved in aiming at literal verisimilitude.”

“Where the Wild Things Are,” which was published in 1963, marked a key stage in Sendak’s development. In 1964, the book received the Caldecott Medal, awarded annually by the American Library Association for the most distinguished American picture book for children. Sendak went to St. Louis for the presentation, and in his acceptance speech he said, “With ‘Where the Wild Things Are,’ I feel I am at the end of a long apprenticeship. By that I mean all my previous work now seems to have been an elaborate preparation for it.” Miss Nordstrom says that “Where the Wild Things Are” is of singular historical importance because “it is the first American picture book for children to recognize that children have powerful emotions—anger and fear as well as the need Max had, after his anger was spent, to be ‘where someone loved him best of all.’ ” She adds, “A lot of good picture books have had fine stories and lovely pictures, and some have touched beautifully on basic elements in a child’s life—physical growth, coming to terms with a new sister or brother, and the like. But it seems to me that ‘Where the Wild Things Are’ goes deeper than previous picture books have gone.”

Miss Nordstrom was not surprised that the book met with some hostile reactions from critics and librarians. “The furor reminded me of the New York Public Library’s refusal to give shelf room to E. B. White’s ‘Stuart Little’ for some months back in 1945, when it came out,” she says. “The statement that Mrs. Little’s second son was born looking very much like a mouse made one librarian there unable to sleep for three nights. Or so she told me. But the children who read and loved that book weren’t thinking of any actual process of giving birth to a mouse—they thought it was nice to have a mouse in the family. There were even some negative reactions to ‘A Hole Is to Dig.’ One librarian was appalled at the definition ‘A face is to make faces with.’ She said she didn’t want her children making faces and when ‘Where the Wild Things Are’ came out, another librarian told me the book would frighten little children to death. ‘But Max conquers those monsters,’ I said. ‘He becomes king of the wild things.’ But she was obviously horrified, perhaps too horrified to imagine that children might react with pleasure to the book.” A reviewer for the Journal of Nursery Education mused, “We should not like to have it left about where a sensitive child might find it to pore over in the twilight.” Publishers’ Weekly , after saying that “the plan and technique of the illustrations are superb,” cautioned, “But they may well prove frightening, accompanied as they are by a pointless and confusing story.” Among the adults who were not traumatized by Max’s journey was a critic for the Library Journal , who wrote, “Each word has been carefully chosen to express Max’s mood precisely,” and “The wild things who acclaim him their king are at once both ugly and humorous.” The critic did, however, feel compelled to add, “This is the kind of story that many adults will question and for many reasons, but the child will accept it wisely and without inhibition, as he knows it is written for him.” A reviewer for the Cleveland Press was also both appreciative of the book and apprehensive about possible adult storms, noting, “Boys and girls may have to shield their parents from this book. Parents are very easily scared.”

Sendak had expected a certain amount of angry reaction to “Where the Wild Things Are.” In his speech accepting the Caldecott Medal, he referred with some acerbity to those noncontroversial children’s books that offer “a gilded world unshadowed by the least suggestion of conflict or pain, a world manufactured by those who cannot—or don’t care to—remember the truth of their own childhood.” Of these he said, “Their expurgated vision has no relation to the way real children live. I suppose these books have some purpose—they don’t frighten adults. . . . The popularity of such books is proof of endless pussyfooting about the grim aspects of child life, pussyfooting that attempts to justify itself by reminding us that we must not frighten our children. Of course, we must avoid frightening children, if by that we mean protecting them from experiences beyond their emotional capabilities; but I doubt that this is what most people mean when they say, ‘We must not frighten our children.’ The need for half-truth books is the most obvious indication of the common wish to protect children from their everyday fears and anxieties, a hopeless wish that denies the child’s endless battle with disturbing emotions.”"
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/panoramas-contemporary-scope,newyorker,Panorama’s Contemporary Scope,[],"Modern music festivals affirm the contemporary. They celebrate a cluster of artists, sounds, and songs that appeal broadly enough and affect deeply enough to gather thousands of people and generate millions of dollars in one weekend. Coachella, the greatest of the great lawns, has grown into a coveted pilgrimage and routinely sells huge numbers of tickets before the bill is even announced. Last year, its organizers eyed the city for a second outpost: Panorama débuted amid small controversy, set to take place on Randall’s Island just a few weeks after the long-standing Governors Ball. “Scheduling two same-genre festivals on top of each other like this makes it difficult for either to provide the maximum benefit to its fans, its neighbors, and taxpayers,” Tom Russell, a Governors Ball co-founder, told Billboard . But Panorama went on as planned; local permit politics mattered little to ticket holders, who probably would have trekked to Flushing Meadows for such a stacked lineup, which ranged from Arcade Fire to Kendrick Lamar to LCD Soundsystem.

This year, some seventy singers, rappers, musicians, and d.j.s will set up and break down across Panorama’s three days, July 28-30. Standouts include MGMT, Girl Talk, Breakbot, and Justice, all part of a generation of indie and electronic twiddlers who restructured pop into a bottom-up format a decade ago—MGMT’s “Electric Feel” and Justice’s “D.A.N.C.E.” have proved evergreen, and their brimming appeal arguably set the tone for the current Spotify sound. Angel Olsen, Future Islands, Mitski, Cherry Glazerr, and Bleached are among the names bolstering college rock today, a scene oscillating between folk and punk, but glossier than traditional images of both, and undoubtedly more female. Like those bands, the rappers Vince Staples, Noname, and 24hrs have yet to enjoy the kind of tentpole hits that reach outside their base; still, a steady stream of output has made their divergent sounds—schizophrenic L.A. rap, soft-shell hip-hop soul, and bludgeoning Southern bounce, respectively—speak to many of the same kids.

But few voices speak louder than Frank Ocean’s, and with so few words. The young singer-songwriter plays his first stateside set since the release of “Blonde,” his dazzling third full-length. Reports from the Lovebox Festival, in the U.K., where Ocean appeared earlier this month, described opacity and elusion; trailed by Spike Jonze with camera in hand, Ocean performed mostly new material in even newer ways, touching only on “Thinkin Bout You” from his best-known album, “Channel Orange.” His controversial old pal Tyler, the Creator is back in the public eye as well—Panorama will be his first show since the début of a new record, “Flower Boy,” which plays on his dual personas of agit-rap anarchist and misunderstood nostalgist while hinting at even more layers. After appearances by Solange and Tame Impala, Sunday sets from Nine Inch Nails and A Tribe Called Quest close out the weekend—two iconic groups who have recently offered new material, diving brow-first into the present while retaining their trademark textures. ♦"
http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-cruelty-and-cynicism-of-trumps-transgender-military-ban,newyorker,The Cruelty and Cynicism of Trump’s Transgender Military Ban,[],"Nearly a half century ago, young Donald Trump—a Wharton graduate, and an avid player of squash, football, and tennis—scored a 1-Y medical deferment. Hundreds of thousands of young men were being deployed to Vietnam. Trump had some bone spurs. He then limped happily into his father’s real-estate business without delay.

When Trump was interviewed by the Times about his deferment during the 2016 campaign, he admitted that the foot condition was “temporary” and “minor”—usually orthotics or stretching eased the pain—and yet, “I had a doctor that gave me a letter—a very strong letter on the heels.” He promised the paper that he would look for the letter. Amazingly, it never turned up. Later, however, his unforgettable physician, Dr. Harold N. Bornstein, assured the nation that Trump, if elected, “will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.”

On Wednesday morning, the Commander-in-Chief declared by tweet-fiat that, “after consultation with my Generals and military experts,” he had decided to reverse an Obama Administration decision and bar transgender individuals from serving in the military “in any capacity.” Trump tweeted further, “Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming . . . victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.”

Let’s begin with the retrograde cruelty. There are thousands of transgender people already serving among the 1.3 million active-duty members of the military. These are people who have volunteered their service and have potentially put their lives on the line, and yet their President, who managed to come up with a flimsy doctor’s note back in the day, denies them their dignity, their equality. He will not “accept or allow” them in the military. Imagine the scale of this insult.

However, today’s outrage—they seem to come at least once daily—is not merely one that reflects on Trump’s low character. It also reveals yet another layer of his political cynicism, and his willingness to use any tactical means available to try to emerge whole from his current predicament.

The President is in the midst of a colossal scandal, and the country, to an increasing measure, knows it. It’s not merely a matter of poor popularity polls. A sizable portion of the country wants to be rid of him and suspects he is unworthy of his office. Six months into his Presidency, according to a USA Today /Media Ethics poll, the country is split on whether or not he should be impeached, with forty-two per cent on either side of the question. The scandal is broad-based, but it surely includes (but is not limited to) contacts with Russian officials during the campaign and potential collusion to undermine the Clinton campaign; the constant lying about same; the firing of James Comey; the threats to fire Jeff Sessions and Robert Mueller; the appalling vulgarity of his public performances (cf. the “Playboy After Dark” speech before the Boy Scouts of America ); the accumulating evidence of a history of sleazy business practices and partners; and the level of sheer incompetence in the West Wing.

It is implausible that Trump paid much attention to his highest-ranking generals, or to experts, generally; Secretary of Defense James Mattis has supported transgender individuals joining the military. And the hardly radical Rand Corporation has published an in-depth study refuting the idea that transgender soldiers are somehow expensive, or that they undermine the morale and cohesion of the military over all. Trump’s decision to bar transgender people from the military is pure politics, cheap and cruel politics, a naked attempt to divert attention from his woes, to hold on to support from his base—a base that he believes will cheer his latest attempt to do battle with the secular-humanist coastal élites who are so obsessed with identity politics. (One Administration official told Axios’s Jonathan Swan that the move was intended to force Democrats from Rust Belt states to take “complete ownership of this issue.”) In other words, it is a decision straight out of the Steve Bannon playbook. Cue the organs of the alt-right press.

Trump likes to declare what a “disaster” the military is, how deeply it has fallen into disrepair, and how he will be its salvation. When you begin to consider the meanness of what Trump has done, it is worth remembering him saying that he was “smarter” than the generals on military matters, and that he mocked John McCain’s service in Vietnam because “I like people who weren’t captured.” When you begin to think about the scale of this offense, it is worth remembering Khizr Khan , the Gold Star father who lost a son in Iraq, addressing Trump directly from the lectern of the Democratic National Convention: “You have sacrificed nothing and no one.”"
http://www.newyorker.com/books/second-read/octavia-butlers-prescient-vision-of-a-zealot-elected-to-make-america-great-again,newyorker,Octavia Butler’s Prescient Vision of a Zealot Elected to “Make America Great Again”,[],"Octavia Butler’s tenth novel, “ Parable of the Sower ,” which was published in 1993, opens in Los Angeles in 2024. Global warming has brought drought and rising seawater. The middle class and working poor live in gated neighborhoods, where they fend off the homeless with guns and walls. Fresh water is scarce, as valuable as money. Pharmaceutical companies have created “smart drugs,” which boost mental performance, and “pyro,” a pill that gives those who take it sexual pleasure from arson. Fires are common. Police services are expensive, though few people trust the police. Public schools are being privatized, as are whole towns. In this atmosphere, a Presidential candidate named Christopher Donner is elected based on his promises to dismantle government programs and bring back jobs.

“Parable of the Sower” unfolds through the journal entries of its protagonist, a fifteen-year-old black girl named Lauren Oya Olamina, who lives with her family in one of the walled neighborhoods. “People have changed the climate of the world,” she observes. “Now they’re waiting for the old days to come back.” She places no hope in Donner, whom she views as “a symbol of the past to hold onto as we’re pushed into the future.” Instead, she equips herself to survive in that future. She practices her aim with BB guns. She collects maps and books on how Native Americans used plants. She develops a belief system of her own, a Darwinian religion she names Earthseed. When the day comes for her to leave her walled enclave, Lauren walks west to the 101 freeway, joining a river of the poor that is flooding north. It’s a dangerous crossing, made more so by a taboo affliction that Lauren was born with, “hyperempathy,” which causes her to feel the pain of others.

By writing black female protagonists into science fiction, and bringing her acute appraisal of real-world power structures to bear on the imaginary worlds she created, Butler became an early pillar of the subgenre and aesthetic known as Afrofuturism. (Kara Walker cites her as an inspiration; and, as Hilton Als has pointed out, Butler is the “ dominant artistic force ” in Beyoncé’s visual album “Lemonade.”) In the ongoing contest over which dystopian classic is most applicable to our time, Kellyanne Conway made a strong case for George Orwell’s “Nineteen Eighty-Four” when she used the phrase “alternative facts” and sent the novel to the top of Amazon’s best-seller list. Margaret Atwood’s “The Handmaid’s Tale” also experienced a resurgence in sales, and its TV adaptation on Hulu inspired protest costumes. But for sheer peculiar prescience, Butler’s novel and its sequel may be unmatched.

Butler was born in 1947, in Pasadena, California, and raised by her grandmother and mother, who worked as a maid. Her father, a shoe shiner, died when she was seven. As a child, she often accompanied her mother to work at a wealthy Pasadena household, where the help entered through back doors. In one of Butler’s first stories, “Flash—Silver Star,” which she wrote at the age of eleven, a young girl is picked up by a U.F.O. from Mars and taken on a tour of the solar system.

Butler ignored the received idea that black people belonged in science fiction only if their blackness was crucial to the plot. (In 1979, a fellow-science-fiction writer advised Butler that points about race might better be made with extraterrestrials.) As she wrote in a 1980 essay for the magazine Transmission , titled “Lost Races of Science Fiction”: ""No writer who regards blacks as people, human beings, with the usual variety of human concerns, flaws, skills, hopes, etc., would have trouble creating interesting backgrounds and goals for black characters.” She later made a habit of explaining, as here to the Times , “I wrote myself in, since I’m me and I’m here and I’m writing. I can write my own stories and I can write myself in.”

In “Octavia E. Butler: Telling My Stories,” an exhibition of Butler’s papers at the Huntington Library, in San Marino, California, which runs through August 7th, there is tangible evidence of her outsize resolve. Over the decades, as she was writing her most popular novel, “ Kindred ,” and two highly regarded series—her five-part Patternist books and her Xenogenesis trilogy—Butler was filling personal journals with affirming mantras. “I am a bestselling writer,” one entry, dated 1975, reads. “I write bestselling books.” She closes: “So be it! See to it!” She was still talking to herself in this manner in 1988, even though by then she had won both a Hugo and a Nebula award, science fiction’s highest honors. “I shall be a bestselling writer,” she writes in a notebook that year. “So be it! See to it!”

By the time she began working on the Parable books, in 1989, Butler was in her forties and had written nine novels. The series, she decided, would be her “If this goes on…” story. In colorful diagrams, Butler extrapolated her vision of a near-future dystopia from what she read in the news, forecasting what kind of collapse might result if the forces of late-stage capitalism, climate change, mass incarceration, big pharma, gun violence, and the tech industry continued unhampered. (“More Hispanics,” she writes in one notebook. “More High Tech.”) Butler took a cyclical view of history. She also thought social progress was reversible. As the public sphere became hollowed out, a fear of change would create an opening for retrograde politics. With collapse, racism would become more overt.

The sequel, “ Parable of the Talents ,” published in 1998, begins in 2032. By then, various forms of indentured servitude and slavery are common, facilitated by high-tech slave collars. The oppression of women has become extreme; those who express their opinion, “nags,” might have their tongues cut out. People are addicted not only to designer drugs but also to “dream masks,” which generate virtual fantasies as guided dreams, allowing wearers to submerge themselves in simpler, happier lives. News comes in the form of disks or “news bullets,” which “purport to tell us all we need to know in flashy pictures and quick, witty, verbal one-two punches. Twenty-five or thirty words are supposed to be enough in a news bullet to explain either a war or an unusual set of Christmas lights.” The Donner Administration has written off science, but a more immediate threat lurks: a violent movement is being whipped up by a new Presidential candidate, Andrew Steele Jarret, a Texas senator and religious zealot who is running on a platform to “make American great again.”

In Butler’s prognosis, humans survive through an intricate logic of interdependence. Soon after leaving her family’s walled neighborhood, Lauren discerns that her natural allies are other people of color, including mixed-race couples, since they are likely to become targets of white violence. Several of the migrants who join Lauren’s pack and the community she later establishes, Acorn, turn out to also be “sharers,” the term for people with hyperempathy. But Butler is not making a sentimental case for the value of empathy. In the day to day of the Parable books, hyperempathy is a liability that makes moving through the world more complicated and, for tactical reasons, requires those who have it to behave more ruthlessly. When defending herself against attackers, Lauren often must shoot or stab to kill, or else risk being immobilized by the pain she inflicts. In one particularly dark manifestation of the syndrome, she is raped and experiences both her own pain and the pleasure of her rapist.

In 1995, Butler became the first science-fiction writer to be awarded a MacArthur fellowship. The grant, she hoped, would enable her to finish four more books she had planned for the Parable series. But the story, she found, was “too depressing.” She changed course and wrote a vampire novel, her last book, “ Fledgling ,” which came out in 2005. The following year, Butler died unexpectedly, at the age of fifty-eight, when she fell and hit her head outside her home, north of Seattle. In her lifetime, Butler insisted that the Parable series was not intended as an augur. “This was not a book about prophecy,” she said, of “Talents,” in remarks she delivered at M.I.T. “This was a cautionary tale, although people have told me it was prophecy. All I have to say to that is: I certainly hope not.”"
http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/trump-supporters-furious-that-they-still-have-health-care,newyorker,Trump Supporters Furious That They Still Have Health Care,[],"WASHINGTON ( The Borowitz Report )—With a fury that could spell political trouble for Republicans in the midterm elections, Trump voters across the country on Friday expressed their outrage and anger that they still have health coverage.

“I went to bed Thursday night and slept like a baby, assuming that when I woke up I would have zero health insurance,” Carol Foyler, a Trump voter, said. “Instead, this nightmare.”

Harland Dorrinson, who voted for Trump “because he promised that he would take my health care away from me on Day 1,” said that he was “very upset” that he will still receive that benefit.

“I woke up this morning, and my family and I could still see a doctor,” he said. “This is a betrayal.”

Many Trump supporters said that congressional Republicans “gave up too soon” in their efforts to deprive ordinary Americans like them of their health care.

“They should not take August off,” Calvin Denoit, a Trump supporter, said. “They should stay in Washington and keep working until I totally lose my coverage.”

For Trump voters like Benoit, the abject disappointment of continuing to have health care raises fears about which other campaign promises might soon be broken.

“Now I don’t know what to believe,” he said. “Are we still going to get to pay billions of dollars in taxes for that wall?”"
http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/dunkirk-a-war-movie-about-patriotic-ciphers,newyorker,“Dunkirk”: A War Movie About Patriotic Ciphers,[],"The outline of Christopher Nolan’s “Dunkirk” is a clever twist on a familiar trilogy: land, sea, and air. Nolan parses a week of combat during the Second World War, from May 26 through June 4, 1940, and the effort to rescue British and French troops into those three components, and gives each a time frame (a week, a day, an hour, respectively) that corresponds to its speed. The movie thus leaps about in time, with each thread of action moving ahead fitfully, until the three threads unite in the movie’s evident conclusion, the successful retreat of more than three hundred thousand soldiers (about two-thirds of them British, one-third French) across the English Channel from Dunkirk, France, to Great Britain. (The movie is centered on British soldiers; the French are a brief but melodramatic afterthought.) The preservation of this fighting force was, of course, crucial for the preservation of Great Britain and the eventual outcome of the war; the retreat was the defeat that helped to secure victory.

Nolan’s construction turns a forward tread into a mosaic and breaks the sense of a unified dramatic arc into a series of observational anecdotes, of isolated deeds and lonely confrontations. He highlights individual acts of courage and heroism, dependent on infinitesimal details of choice and chance, on which the overall historic event depends. In separating three through-lines and fields of action, Nolan suggests the uncertainty, the indeterminacy, the quasi-metaphysical randomness, and the seemingly miraculous synergy of disparate events of which the outcome was comprised. The hand of pure chance weighs heavily in the opening scene, for instance, which features one British soldier—who has just escaped a heavy-machine-gun barrage in the streets of Dunkirk—reaching the beach, where thousands of other soldiers are lined up and waiting to board ships. Suddenly, a German bomber roars overhead; the soldiers drop to a crouch, bombs fall, and some soldiers are blown to oblivion, while others get up and reassemble, bearing stretchers carrying the fallen toward ships.

That bloodless opening scene is the first sign that “Dunkirk” is no “Saving Private Ryan”; Nolan suppresses the mutilations and agonies of war to focus on its basic moral horror. (There’s only one brief scene of excruciating physical horror, involving fire in the water.) “Dunkirk” is a movie of paradox; its very subject is character, the mettle of men (and almost all of the characters, and all of the principal ones, are male) who, faced with decisions that could mean life or death for themselves and others, master their emotions and act thoughtfully, responsibly, honorably, potentially self-sacrificingly for the good of a collective mission that they’re all aware of: to get back to Great Britain in order to defend it against a likely attack by Germany. Yet Nolan doesn’t delve into their character at all—doesn’t at all consider any personal traits that foster such bravery. The film is, rather, both literally and figuratively, a collection of war stories—a set of anecdotes that stay rigorously within the context of battle, that emphasize the courage and the severity, the existential moment of war (and do so with a portentous shadowing of telling details) while showing nothing (actually nothing) of the soldiers outside the realm of battle.

It has been a recent trend in movies to blank out characters—to filter out thoughts and emotions that render them as complex individuals rather than visual-shorthand types. In many cases (as in “Baby Driver”and “War Machine”), this seems less a directorial choice than a lack of artistic imagination. In Nolan’s case, it’s something of a surprise: for all his jigsaw scripting and visual bombast, Nolan is also a director of backstory. He’s passionate about it (as in “Inception”) as about little else. I’ve been wondering whether, in “Dunkirk,” Nolan feels morally inhibited about ascribing to real-life characters and situations the depth of imagination that he feels free to pour into fictional ones. Yet I think that the blankness of his characters is a directorial decision—not merely the mark but the essence of his overarching artistic strategy.

With “Dunkirk,” Nolan has made what may be the first V.R. movie—one that does its best to put viewers literally into the position of combatants and participants in the Dunkirk rescue, as if viewers were meant to fill in the blanks of the characters’ inner lives with their own and imagine themselves to be fighting the Second World War for the very preservation of Great Britain. It isn’t (I suppose) that Nolan can’t or won’t conceive of that generations’ mental and personal life, but that he’s sufficiently awed by their achievements and wants to place viewers’ little feet into our predecessors’ giant shoes—to let us clomp around in them and imagine the strength that went into even the slightest step under those circumstances. “Dunkirk” is, in that sense, a war movie with a daddy complex. (Nolan differs in this regard from Steven Spielberg, who faces his cinematic father issues by trying on the big shoes himself.)

Of course, there’s much else from those times that is almost impossible to imagine. Many people today would agree that there’s something distinctive and world-historic about the Second World War, which has something to do with what’ s distinctive about the ideological differences between the two sides, between the values of the Allied powers and those of Nazism. But the Germans, let alone the Nazis, seem to have nothing to do with what Nolan’s characters are fighting for. The word “Nazi” is never heard; there’s no mention of Hitler; I don’t even think I heard the word “Germans” (once, someone refers to them by the British slang term “Jerries”). Nolan’s subject lies elsewhere, lies hidden—it’s his tribute to the collective purpose, the national unity, the total mobilization for a total war in which Britain’s very existence, the very existence of national culture, is at stake. Nolan achieves that paean to patriotic unity not by seeing and hearing it forged from multiplicity, but by excluding multiplicity, filtering out everything that isn’t already a part of it. In a weird and likely unintended way, the result is a tribute to the virtue-inspiring power of war.

The fastidiously severe images that are usually a watermark of Nolan’s willful artistry here give way to an anonymously practical recessiveness; rather than inflect his images, he lets the scale of his format, the 70mm. negative and the IMAX screen, do the bulk of the visual work. The next step in the movie’s immersive viewing might have been for cold water to wash along the aisles. Hans Zimmer’s absurdly overbearing music, which virtually bellows emotional commands at viewers, is matched by Nolan’s use of bass sounds—whether those of the music or of sound effects—that made the floor rumble and the seats shake at the IMAX screening I attended. The sensory overload of “Dunkirk” is also an anti-intellectual barrage that effaces the actual differences that were overcome with difficulty in pursuing the war—not just personal ones but also skepticism of bureaucracy, resentment of military discipline and hierarchy, social and political conflicts—the full spectrum of public discord that may have been muted in the midst of the war but that were detailed afterward by journalists, historians, and artists. (George Orwell’s wartime writings also give a sense of it.) “Dunkirk” seems, rather, like one of the self-censoring exhortations of wartime itself. Nolan’s sense of memory and of history is as flattened-out and untroubled as his sense of psychology and of character.

When it comes to watching movies, I’m format-agnostic. It’s a pleasure to see movies projected in public on the big screen. The air section of “Dunkirk,” in particular, is a visual wonder—less because Nolan’s direction of the sequences is distinctive than because solo flight in combat is irresistibly, sensuously fascinating to watch, and has been so since William Wellman’s “Wings” (1927) and Howard Hawks’s “The Dawn Patrol” and Howard Hughes’s “Hell’s Angels” (both from 1930)—and the expanse of sky is all the more engulfing, thrilling, terrifying on a screen the size of an apartment building. But it’s also a pleasure to watch movies, even visually daring movies, at home, on TV or even a computer, and pause to savor, freeze frames, back up, and watch scenes again, or even watch some parts backward. There are differences between the feelings aroused by different modes of viewing—but the differences are different from film to film, and a movie that seems good in one format will always seem so (if differently) in another. Except, perhaps, for “Dunkirk,” which, if it’s not seen in enveloping and engulfing and body-shaking scale, may be nothing at all."
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/the-tv-that-created-donald-trump,newyorker,The TV That Created Donald Trump,[],"For months, it felt easier to avoid watching Donald Trump on television. It was like sniffing spoiled milk: you didn’t need a sip to know it was bad. Then, in June, the President held the first meeting of his complete Cabinet. It aired live, as Trump’s early campaign rallies had, in full and without commentary, on CNN. Wearing a striped tie that rhymed with the flag behind him, Trump sat at a massive table, smiling. “Mike?” Trump said, and Vice-President Pence took the cue. “Thank you, Mr. President. It is the greatest privilege of my life to serve as Vice-President to a President who is keeping his word to the American people.” As cameras clicked like cicadas, each appointee offered up an homage; Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, thanked Trump for the “opportunity and the blessing that you’ve given us to serve your agenda.” Many compared the spectacle to something out of North Korea. But it was also a near-replica of a production closer to home. It’s become a wearying, ugly observation, a media truism at once superficial and deep: if “The Apprentice” didn’t get Trump elected, it is surely what made him electable. Over fourteen seasons, the television producer Mark Burnett helped turn the Donald Trump of the late nineties—the disgraced huckster who had trashed Atlantic City; a tabloid pariah to whom no bank would lend—into a titan of industry, nationally admired for being, in his own words, “the highest-quality brand.” And here we were again, at the boardroom table, listening to the compliments to the boss, suspended in that eerie, unstable blend of improvisation and scripting. It was enough to make a television critic nostalgic. As it happens, most episodes of Trump on “The Apprentice” are curiously hard to find: they’re not available to stream or download. Only first-season DVDs are for sale, legally, online—and only used ones. The show is not at the Paley Center for Media’s research library, either. (M-G-M, which owns the rights, declined to comment.) To watch, you’ll need occult methods. But at the Paley you can catch something nearly as illuminating: a video of a panel discussion about the show, from 2004, following its first season. It was filmed the day after “The Apprentice” lost the Emmy for best reality show to “The Amazing Race.” The moderator is the “Access Hollywood” host Billy Bush, who, a year later, played Trump’s wingman in the pussy-grabbing tape. Trump, in a dark suit, leans forward in his chair, hands clasped. Mark Burnett, wearing jeans and a shell necklace, lounges next to him. Both are aglow. A year earlier, NBC, whose TV programming was then run by Jeff Zucker, had been in free fall, with the hit sitcom “Friends” about to end and nothing to replace it. Burnett and Trump had provided Zucker with a hat trick: the network’s first strong reality franchise; a solution for its Must-See TV Thursday slot; and a lure for ads from corporations like Pepsi and Microsoft. Bush asks surprisingly tough questions: he wonders whether Burnett softened Trump with an image “makeover”; he talks about whether reality television is a fad, and whether it’s cruel; and he asks what it felt like to lose the Emmy. As the drip of praise slows, Trump shows flashes of sourness, griping about old enemies, like the host of “The View”—“this fat slob Joy Behar who can’t stand me.” Burnett never wavers. A brilliant entrepreneur, and one of the most powerful men in television, he had produced “Survivor,” on CBS, which exploded the economics and aesthetics of television, launching a transformative new genre. “The Apprentice” was the savvy workplace variation that he pitched to Trump in 2002. And yet Burnett presents himself, whether humbly or cannily, as Trump’s acolyte: Robin to Trump’s Batman, he insists. Then he casts Trump in a fresh light, years before the 2016 campaign. Trump, Burnett explains, struck him as “a real American maverick tycoon.” Donald “will say whatever he wants.” He “takes no prisoners. If you’re Donald’s friend, he’ll defend you all day long. If you’re not, he’s going to kill you. And that’s very American. He’s like the guys who built the West. America is the one country that supports the entire world—because of guys like Donald, who create jobs and a tax base that can support the entire planet.” That’s what “The Apprentice” means to him, the producer concludes, with a grin: it’s “a love letter from me to America, and to New York City, because we chose New York City, about what makes America great.”

In a 1981 segment of “Rona Barrett Looks at Today’s Super Rich,” the gossip columnist asks the thirty-four-year-old Trump if he’d consider a run for President. Trump laments that television has ruined politics, to the extent that Abraham Lincoln could no longer get elected: “He was not a handsome man and he did not smile at all.” He skirts questions about his political pull, his controversial tax abatements. With his cold eyes, baby cheeks, and rosebud mouth, he resembles James Spader—silky and guarded, a Master of the Universe in a boxy brown suit. Throughout the eighties, as Trump built Trump Tower, then the Javits Center, helping to make Manhattan into a luxury playground, he played himself on television. He was omnipresent in pop culture, often as a punch line. He was the “short-fingered vulgarian” of Spy and the inspiration for the bully-villain of “Back to the Future Part II.” But on TV he had swagger: in 1985, he feuded with Mayor Ed Koch on “60 Minutes”; he was a sharp-dressed landlord on the Judith Krantz miniseries “I’ll Take Manhattan”; he appeared briefly in a 1983 “This Old House” episode about Trump Tower. There were numerous appearances on David Letterman, and the time when he asked Larry King, “Do you mind if I sit back a little bit, because your breath is very bad. . . . Has this ever been told to you before?” (King laughed, shocked, and then analyzed Trump’s neg: “That’s how you get the edge.”) Early on, Trump had greater self-control than he had as a candidate, but he couldn’t quite crack the likability factor—and, maybe, he didn’t want to. Long before Tony Soprano launched the anti-hero drama, Trump was that guy. He was a handsome go-getter, but also an arrogant self-promoter, proud of his toughness, a flirt with a fat wallet. On “60 Minutes,” he complains about media coverage. “I believe they like to make me out as somebody a little more sinister than I really am,” he tells Mike Wallace. “I don’t look at myself, necessarily, as being sinister.” In 1990, Trump appeared on a game show called “Trump Card,” set at Trump’s Castle, in Atlantic City. As his life became unstable, rocked by divorces and bankruptcies, his TV persona stayed flush. He made cameos on sitcoms: on a 1994 episode of “The Fresh Prince of Bel Air” (Carlton faints in admiration); on a 1996 episode of “The Nanny” (he dates Fran). In 1999, he ruined a perfectly good episode of “Sex and the City.” In these incarnations, Trump is a Manhattan fixture. And yet it feels as though he’s shrunk to a fun-size Trump: red tie, yellow hair, “the Donald.” He’s less an icon than he is a retro cartoon. By the turn of this century, in the eyes of New Yorkers, all that remained of the once powerful developer was his logo. This was when he began to reinvent himself as a star in new genres: reality television, pro wrestling, and cable news, particularly Fox News. These combative art forms suited his style—flamboyant and vaudevillian. When Trump first entered TV, the entire medium had been dismissed as junk. Now, even as critics were swooning over the artistry of cable drama, Trump swerved deeper, into stranger regions, straight into the types of television that nobody took seriously, the ones dismissed as guilty pleasures.

When Burnett pitched Trump to NBC, it was as the host of only the first season of “The Apprentice”; after him, new tycoons, including Mark Cuban and Martha Stewart, were supposed to step in. According to the book “Trump Revealed” (2016), by Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher, the plan quickly changed. Trump’s comfort on camera, his ability to improvise—including the “You’re fired!” tagline—cemented his value, as did the strong first-season ratings. Burnett conceived of the show as “Survivor” in the “urban jungle,” and it became NBC’s flagship. Trump’s relationship with viewers was transformed: “He was a hero, and he had not been one before,” Jim Dowd, then NBC’s publicity director, told Kranish and Fisher. Rewatching “The Apprentice” more than a decade later, it’s easy to see why it struck a chord. Glossy and upbeat, the show, which débuted after 9/11 but before the economic collapse, introduced itself as a stirring advertisement for Wall Street as a meritocracy. Each episode opens with the earworm “For the Love of Money,” by the O’Jays, with its “moneymoneymoneymoney” groove: “Talk about cash money! / Dollar bills, y’all . . . For that lean lean lean mean green / Almighty dollar.” The credits feature a dazzling, supersaturated montage of Manhattan, studded with Trump logos, along with cabs, clocks, sped-up clouds. The names of contestants glide by, in neon, formatted as Wall Street tickers. In the voice-over that begins the pilot, Trump recasts his failures as triumphs: “I fought back and won—big league. I used my brain. I used my negotiating skills.” Now he will teach us to do the same. The show’s early contestants were bona-fide strivers, with business backgrounds, not show-biz wannabes. In Season 1, there’s a nerd, Sam Solovey, who moons over Trump like a stalker; and there’s the villainous, dishonest Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth, who became a breakout star (and, once Trump was elected, assistant to the President in the White House). But the contest narrows to a white Loyola graduate named Bill Rancic and an African-American Harvard M.B.A., Kwame Jackson. As Joshua Green points out, in his book, “Devil’s Bargain,” “The Apprentice” attracted an unusually high percentage of black and Latino viewers, in part because it highlighted contestants from those groups not as criminals but as entrepreneurs. It also featured contestants from Asian, Indian, and Middle Eastern backgrounds, and, in Season 5, recent immigrants. But race is rarely explicitly discussed. Gender is, all the time. In fact, from a certain angle, the show resembles a “Lean In” feminist boot camp. In this utopian twist on Wall Street, half the players are female, and, initially, all are on the same team. Together, they strategize about how to work with their eccentric male boss and his icy female lieutenant (in later seasons, Trump’s daughter Ivanka). He’s a supportive mentor, but he’s also prone to saying things like “You’re all beautiful women. Do you think you had an advantage over the men, in selling ice cream?” The show’s early “challenges” are sweetly low-key: in the pilot, the players hawk lemonade—no brand names are visible. As with most reality shows, a huge proportion of the series consists of facial expressions—apprehension, disgust, glee—with musical cues, to heighten tiny conflicts. But each episode ends in grandeur, when Trump arrives to pass judgment. First, the losing team deconstructs its failings. Then three candidates grovel before him. Finally, one gets fired, and descends in a golden elevator. These final sequences take place in a boardroom so dimly lit that stripes of shadow pass over the contestants’ faces, as if they were crossing into the underworld. In many ways, “The Apprentice” is a classic reality show of the era, a sleek blend of game show, documentary, and soap opera, spiked with comedy. And yet “The Apprentice” is also “classy,” in Trumpian terms: no one eats bugs or gets too drunk. It’s a fun, upscale fantasy, a voguing competition in executive realness. “You jest.” In one way, however, it departs radically from reality: no one criticizes the boss. Instead, the Trump of “The Apprentice” receives endless praise, even behind his back. All scandal and debt are erased; Trump’s combative streak is alchemized into Daddy’s tough love. Celebrities who sign up for reality shows often agree to be made fun of. On “The Apprentice,” while Trump is outrageous, he’s rarely ridiculous: if he insults people, they deserve it (and often love it). He’s a family man and a business genius. Contestants are grateful for his attention, even negative attention, since he could be off doing deals. Frequently, he narrates from a helicopter, hovering like Zeus. Early on, the prizes are tied to Trump’s biography: a visit to his Louis Quatorze apartment (which he describes as being generally reserved for “Presidents and kings”), to meet his then girlfriend, Melania; dinner at the 21 Club, where the winner is seated at the “Fred Trump table.” In the finale, the winner chooses which Trump property to help manage. Often, the winners—who do, in fact, go on to work for Trump, with a salary of $250,000—tell him that they’ve chosen the project that will let them be “closer to you.” The Trump of “The Apprentice” is not a wholly foreign figure. In the second episode, he practically pulls the advertising C.E.O. Donny Deutsch off his feet with a handshake. He rates women’s looks reflexively. He’s also hung up on eugenics, an unspoken contradiction of the show’s meritocratic themes. In one episode, Sam is interrogated in the boardroom. “You don’t believe in the genetic pool? That what you have, you have?” Trump asks Sam. “I’ve got genetic pool big-time, Mr. Trump!” Sam insists, gesticulating. “Just like you got from your father, Fred Trump, and your mother, Mary Trump.” Trump determines who has a “lousy personality” and who “is not very well liked”—this comes up most often with women, especially in the show’s final rounds. He can be crude. “This suit is really gross,” he says, dangling a skimpy bathing suit, designed by a black gay contestant. Yet the negativity doesn’t linger. “The Apprentice” is set in a patriotic world of capitalist potential, where the boss takes you in a helicopter to view the Empire State Building (he boasts, deceptively, about his stake in it), and to gaze at the sunset-lit Statue of Liberty, which is, in Trump’s telling, “one of the truly beautiful symbols of anything, anywhere in the world.” In an emotional voice-over, the contestant Adam Israelov speaks about his immigrant father, who arrived with “nothing in his pocket.” “Not bad, Adam,” Trump says. “If you make a lot of money, this”—he gestures at their private aerie—“is the way you’re going to live.”

After Season 1, the ratings began to drop. Each year, Trump obsessed over and lied about them, needling reporters who cited them. Even during the 2004 Paley panel, which took place just over a week into the second season, Trump complained that the show’s launch did better because in January “everyone was watching TV,” whereas, in September, “everyone was playing golf.” As cable began its ascent, Trump clung tightly to network values: quality measured only by ad dollars and Nielsen ratings. The producers began to fiddle with the recipe. The second season stuck with the men against the women; the next tried “street smarts” versus “book smarts.” Then back to a battle of the sexes, then no categories, with the contestants instead advertised as “personally selected by Trump.” He had other ideas: in 2005, Entertainment Weekly reported that he wanted to pit black contestants against white ones. (“Whether people like that idea or not, it is somewhat reflective of our very vicious world,” he explained later.) The sixth season jumped to Los Angeles, where each week’s winning team (the Haves) lived in a mansion and the losers (the Have-nots) in a “tent city.” Each year, the challenges got less creative; often, contestants were simply deputized to promote a sponsor. Trump seemed crankier and nastier. He more frequently called people “losers,” “quitters,” “pathetic.” In 2007, NBC dropped “The Apprentice” from its fall schedule. In what felt like a preëmptive strike, Trump announced new reality-TV projects, without Burnett. There was “Pageant Place,” for MTV, about an apartment full of beauty queens. And there was “Lady or a Tramp,” a Fox series in which “rude and crude” party girls were sent to finishing school—a concept that, over two years, morphed into the Britishized show “The Girls of Hedsor Hall.” The host was Tara Conner, a former Miss USA, to whom Trump had given a second chance after she broke pageant rules. The comedian Rosie O’Donnell accused him of hypocrisy—who was the womanizing Trump to judge? During a press conference for the show, in 2009, Trump spun the incident into a crass rant, speculating about O’Donnell’s motivations: “Tara, I hate to tell you this, for reasons you don’t want to know about, but Rosie would have given you a second , third , and fourth chance, O.K.? And she would’ve loved every minute of it.” Neither series lasted more than a season. This lurid display was a striking break from “The Apprentice.” But Trump was also embracing yet another role, one that let him play out his most aggressive and debasing impulses: a spot in the pro-wrestling ring, an industry he’d supported since 1988, when he sponsored the W.W.E. event WrestleMania. The first W.W.E. Trump-based story was a bout between wrestlers dressed up as “Trump” and “Rosie,” a one-time experiment that flopped with fans. Then, the spring that “The Apprentice” vanished from NBC, Trump himself entered the ring as a W.W.E. character—a preening, crudely macho version of his role on “The Apprentice.” In the story, “Mr. Trump” arrives to vanquish his former friend Vince McMahon, the insecure tyrant who owns the W.W.E. Trump is introduced as an Oz-like face on a giant screen, as “For the Love of Money” plays and dollar bills tumble from the rafters. (McMahon’s money, not Trump’s.) Their showdown is more of a bro-down: Trump brags that his “Trump Towers” are bigger than McMahon’s “grapefruits.” The audience might be rooting for Trump, McMahon says, “but ninety-five per cent of them are idiots.” Trump replies, “To me, they look like a very smart group of people.” Wrestling—even more than reality TV—makes anyone who describes it sound like a lunatic. But the series climax, “Battle of the Billionaires,” is so campily homoerotic, so rife with heat and humiliation, that it’s a critic-proof fever dream. “It’s the hostile takeover of Donald Trump!” announcers shriek, as Trump pounds McMahon. Trump’s “second” in the ring is a near-naked black wrestler named Bobby Lashley. McMahon is represented in the ring by Umaga, a Samoan who grunts and screams. When Trump wins, he shaves McMahon’s head. Trump might have forged a different path on television, as a libidinous Barnum. Instead, in 2007, just before the economy crashed, NBC revived his old show as “The Celebrity Apprentice.” The reboot was glitzier, more circus-like. The ensemble now comprised C-level celebrities: wrestlers and lesser-known country singers; piggish guys like the rock star Gene Simmons, who bonded with Trump over women; and various others, among them the singer Cyndi Lauper, the athlete Darryl Strawberry, and the disgraced Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich. Rather than compete for a job, the contestants raised money for charities, often by pestering more famous friends. The professional poker player Annie Duke gives to Refugees International, interviewing an Iraqi translator who had difficulty getting visas for her children; Simmons to the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation. The original show had painted the bankrupt Trump as a respected mogul; “The Celebrity Apprentice” made the tightwad a philanthropist. During Season 5, Trump filmed a special boardroom segment with Ignacio, a child beneficiary of the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Ignacio, from Milwaukee, had won an essay contest on “Why I’m Proud to Be Bilingual.” His “wish” is to be fired by Trump. Instead, the host praises him and hands him a check. For all the do-gooder icing, the deeper shift was toward more aggressive product integration. As always, Trump touts his hotels and resorts, his water and his ties; and the celebrities do the same for their albums and perfumes. The human brands praise the corporate ones, which benefit by association with the charitable ones. The structure echoes that of the Trump Foundation: each week, money is funnelled to philanthropy under Trump’s name, though none of it is donated by him. Whereas the original “Apprentice” bore some resemblance to Wall Street training, “The Celebrity Apprentice” was sheer shilling: its sponsors paid from five million to nine million dollars for a slot, according to an estimation by Ad Age . “There’s never been another show where you’ve had a product sold for two hours,” Trump told the magazine, in 2011. “They do a 30-second commercial, but where do they do two hours?” The value of those products was another matter. In one episode, about identity theft (“a yuge problem,” Trump says), the sponsors are Norton and Lifelock, a subscription online-security service based in Tempe, Arizona. The challenge is to create an advertorial in Time . In a particularly delightful moment, Blagojevich worries that they’re misusing the term “bank fraud” in their copy. The episode aired on March 28, 2010. Nineteen days earlier, the F.T.C. had fined Lifelock twelve million dollars for deceptive business practices and for failing to secure sensitive customer data. In 2015, the company was ordered to pay a hundred million dollars after failing to meet security standards. In the third episode of Season 7, “Outside the Box,” the client is Kodak, which also sponsored the season, creating miniature “Kodak moments.” In January, 2007, when the episode aired, Kodak was veering toward collapse, owing to the rise of digital photography. But, on “The Celebrity Apprentice,” Kodak appeared to be a gleaming model of vigorous corporate muscle, a company that had “reinvested in digital.” The two contestant teams—Empresario and Hydra—are assigned to create Airstream trailers touting the company’s printer ink. Inspecting the project is a guest judge, Jim Cramer, the investment-plugging host of “Mad Money,” on CNBC. He greets the country-music star Trace Adkins by saying, “How’s business?” Trace drawls back, “Well, you know, I’ve got a stock tip for you, man.” As Cramer smiles encouragingly, Adkins explains that, once he’s “done exposing the world to what the Kodak Easyshare will do,” the stock will be “through the roof.” In the boardroom, Simmons is mocked for talking back to the clients when they reject his slogan, “It’s a Kodak World.” “Talk your way out of this one, big boy!” the British pundit Piers Morgan scoffs. “Mate, you say Kodak’s wrong. Kodak’s the biggest success story in America right now.” In the end, Trump fires Simmons. Two years later, the company posted a hundred-and-thirty-seven-million-dollar loss. In 2012, it filed for bankruptcy."
http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson-sorkin/lisa-murkowski-lindsey-graham-and-how-the-health-care-vote-went-down,newyorker,"Lisa Murkowski, Lindsey Graham, and How the Health-Care Vote Went Down",[],"Two Republican senators—Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, and Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina—separately spoke to the press yesterday, in the tense hours before the failure of their party’s latest plan to destroy Obamacare, and the contrast between those exchanges says a good deal about the current political moment. Both senators, for different reasons, presented themselves as possible no votes on Senator Mitch McConnell’s “skinny repeal.” When Graham spoke to the press, he called that bill “a fraud.” But only Murkowski opposed it when the votes were counted, joining with Susan Collins, of Maine, and, in a late, dramatic addition, John McCain , of Arizona, to protect health-care coverage for millions of Americans.

Murkowski did so despite being the object of crass insults and bullying from President Donald Trump, conveyed via tweet, telephone, and emissary. There were reports that Ryan Zinke, the Secretary of the Interior , had called her about her no on earlier versions of the bill, saying that Alaska might find that it had a little trouble as a result—as if the state were someone’s aunt’s candy store, and might have its windows broken. Her encounter with the press came as she was hurrying down a hall in the Capitol. As she walked and consulted with aides about where she was supposed to go, she confirmed that Zinke had called her, saying that he had just “told me what I already knew” from her own conversations with the President, which was that Trump “wasn’t pleased.” But when a reporter asked, of Zinke, “Did he threaten you?” Murkowski stopped and turned to the microphone.

“You know, I don’t think it’s appropriate to use words like that,” Murkowski said. (This was around the same time that Anthony Scaramucci, in a call to my colleague Ryan Lizza , upended the definition of “appropriate” Washington words.) She continued, “The reality is, it was a difficult conversation. And what I told the President, what I have told the President since he was elected, is that I’m here to help the people of Alaska, and that I’m here to help the people of this country.” That is an exotic standard in today’s Washington. One might also pause to appreciate Murkowski’s rhetorical power move: she wasn’t even going to engage with Zinke’s posturing; the man she was talking to was his boss. More practically, Murkowski, who chairs the Senate’s Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which has oversight over the Interior Department, decided to delay a series of confirmation hearings; she is not anybody’s fool. (Dan Sullivan, Alaska’s other senator, also got a call from Zinke about Murkowski’s behavior, but his reaction—he told reporters that Zinke had made him “fear” for Alaska’s well-being—had an edge of panic.)

Senator Graham had a different set of worries, which might be summed up this way: he could no longer reliably gauge how irrational, irresponsible, and self-destructive members of his own party might be. At a press conference at which he appeared with McCain and Senators Ron Johnson, of Wisconsin, and Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana, Graham described what he called “the pitch” from the Party’s leaders: if the Senate passed the skinny bill, which would lead to fifteen million Americans losing their coverage and, possibly, the collapse of insurance markets, then an entirely new bill could be worked out in what is known as a conference committee with the House, which had already passed a version that would lead to even more Americans losing their coverage. That pitch, Graham said, “makes eminent sense to me.” He was happy to vote for a bill that he described, to the assembled reporters, as “a disaster” and “terrible policy” in the name of keeping the effort to kill Obamacare going, with one condition: “we actually go to conference.” But he’d received a disturbing phone call from a friend of his in the House’s Freedom Caucus, who had tipped him off to a movement to treat the skinny bill as “the final product”—that is, to “go directly to the House Floor, vote on it, and that goes to the President’s desk,” where it would, no doubt, be signed into law. Graham’s great fear, then, was that the manifest awfulness of the skinny bill would not stop House Republicans from voting for it; it certainly wouldn’t stop Trump from signing it.

Graham said that all he needed to get to yes was a guarantee from Ryan and his team that the House wouldn’t pass the skinny bill without a conference. But, so far, he had only been told that Ryan “ prefers to go to the conference, intends to go to the conference. I want to know, like, are you going to go to the conference?” Graham’s fears about Ryan’s reliability—would he, in a pinch, give in to Obamacare extremists?—reveal how uncertain even leading members of the Republican Party are about who, exactly, has leverage over whom. The instruments of moderation appear to be broken. When the House was considering its health-care bill, Ryan won over votes by promising, in effect, that the Senate would fix the crazier parts; that didn’t happen.

Graham presented his stand as an example of down-home common sense. He told reporters, “If I don’t get those assurances, I’m a no, because I’m not going to vote for a pig in a poke.” And yet Graham, by asking for guarantees that the skinny bill would just be a placeholder for some unknown future measure, was the one demanding to vote for a pig in a poke. Similarly, when he said, of Obamacare, “I’d rather get out of the way and let it collapse than have a half-assed approach where it is now our problem,” it was hard to pinpoint his own concept of responsible governance.

McCain followed Graham to the lectern and said that he, too, couldn’t vote for the bill without knowing that there would be a conference. But McCain added a word to his vision of those negotiations: “bipartisan.” Perhaps Graham didn’t hear him. A few hours later, he voted for the bill—the final text of which was not revealed until 10 P.M. —after declaring that Ryan had finally assured him that the bill that he was voting for would never become law. He might have saved himself the trouble and voted against it. McCain kept his decision to himself until late in the night. Then, when his name was called, he spotted Murkowski and smiled at her, gave a thumbs down, and said “no.” She already knew what she had to do."
http://www.newyorker.com/news/ryan-lizza/how-jared-kushner-helped-the-russians-get-inside-access-to-the-trump-campaign,newyorker,How Jared Kushner Helped the Russians Get Inside Access to the Trump Campaign,[],"If you read Jared Kushner’s statement to congressional committees looking for evidence of a crime, there isn’t much there. But if you read it from the perspective of the Russians trying to gain a toehold—or more—inside the Trump campaign, you realize how easy he made it for them. As the evidence mounted last year that the Russian government launched an unprecedented hacking and influence campaign to affect the 2016 election in Donald Trump’s favor, the Trump team, including Kushner, became increasingly more solicitous to high-level Russians offering information and requesting meetings.

Kushner’s first meeting with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian Ambassador to the United States, seems relatively innocuous. According to Kushner’s account, they met in April, 2016, at the Mayflower Hotel, in Washington, D.C., during a reception before a speech that Trump delivered on foreign policy. Dimitri Simes, the publisher of The National Interest and the organizer of the event, introduced Kushner to Kislyak and three other ambassadors. To Kushner, the introduction was forgettable. Without specifying which ones, he noted that some of the ambassadors invited him to lunch but that he “never took them up on any of these invitations.”

For Kislyak, it was clearly an important moment. The Russian Ambassador represents a country whose intelligence services had hacked their way into the Democratic National Committee’s networks ten months earlier and hacked the e-mail account of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, the previous month. At Trump’s speech, Kislyak was honored with an invitation to the reception and a front-row seat . Trump’s speech itself extended an olive branch to Vladimir Putin, calling for “improved relations with Russia” and an effort to “make a deal that’s great” for “America, but also good for Russia.”

By May, Russia’s General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate—the G.R.U.—“had exfiltrated large volumes of data from the DNC,” according to the U.S. intelligence community’s unclassified report on Russian meddling. In June, the Russian government adopted “a clear preference” for Trump, according to the report. “Beginning in June, Putin’s public comments about the U.S. presidential race avoided directly praising President-elect Trump, probably because Kremlin officials thought that any praise from Putin personally would backfire in the United States. Nonetheless, Putin publicly indicated a preference for President-elect Trump’s stated policy to work with Russia, and pro-Kremlin figures spoke highly about what they saw as his Russia-friendly positions on Syria and Ukraine.”

That same month, Russian associates of the Trump family reached out to offer the Trump campaign some direct assistance. On June 3rd, Rob Goldstone , a British music publicist and former tabloid journalist, e-mailed Donald Trump, Jr., offering “some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,” and noted that the offer was “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” A meeting was set for June 9th , and Trump’s oldest child forwarded the full e-mail exchange to Kushner and Paul Manafort, who at the time was the campaign chairman. The subject line was “Russia - Clinton - private and confidential.”

Yesterday, Kushner insisted, “I did not read or recall this e-mail exchange before it was shown to me by my lawyers.” Whether or not that’s true, he attended the meeting. According to Kushner’s account of the meeting, it was uneventful. He got there late, some Russians he never heard of were discussing adoption policy, and he quickly messaged his assistant to call him so he had an excuse to bail. Longtime intelligence officials have a more jaundiced view. Michael Hayden, the former head of the Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency, told me that he was convinced the meeting was a classic “soft approach” by Russian intelligence. He cited a recent Washington Post article , by Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, that argued that the meeting “is in line with what intelligence analysts would expect an overture in a Russian influence operation to look like,” and that it may have been the “green light Russia was looking for to launch a more aggressive phase of intervention in the U.S. election.”

Hayden told me, “My god, this is just such traditional tradecraft.” He said that he has talked to people in the intelligence community about Mowatt-Larssen’s theory and that “every case officer I’ve pushed on this” agreed with it. “This is how they do it.”

Hayden explained that the Russians would have learned several things from the approach. “Would they take the meeting?” he said. “So, then you get the willingness. No. 2, would they report the meeting?” Hayden suggested that Russian intelligence was sophisticated enough to know whether the Trump campaign reported the meeting to the F.B.I., which it didn’t. So, while Kushner claimed that the meeting was irrelevant, from a Russian intelligence perspective it would have been seen as a clear signal. “At the end, they have established that these guys are willing,” Hayden said, pausing. “How do I put this? They did not reject a relationship.”

The intelligence community’s report makes a similar point, noting, “Russian influence campaigns are multifaceted and designed to be deniable because they use a mix of agents of influence, cutouts, front organizations, and false-flag operations.”

On July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks published its first batch of e-mails stolen from the D.N.C., and revelations contained in the e-mails became a favorite topic for the Trump campaign throughout the summer and fall. On October 4th, after a lengthy internal debate, the Obama Administration finally went public with its accusations about Russia’s meddling. “The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations,” a joint statement by the Department of Homeland Security and the director of National Intelligence that was posted at 3:30 P.M. said. One hour later, Podesta’s e-mails were released by WikiLeaks. (It was an eventful day : in between, at about 4 P.M. , the infamous “ Access Hollywood ” tape was also released.)

The Trump campaign was more interested in the release from WikiLeaks than the release from the intelligence community. “This just came out—WikiLeaks!” Trump exclaimed at a rally on October 10, 2016, in Pennsylvania, promoting the latest disclosures. “I love WikiLeaks!” Trump, according to one count , mentioned the group or the leaked e-mails a hundred and sixty-four times in the last thirty days of the campaign.

Eric Swalwell, a Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told me that one of the key questions that congressional investigators have for Kushner is why he ignored the intelligence community’s warnings about Russia. “Once it became public that they were interfering in our election, which was in June, why did you continue to have contacts with them?” Swalwell, whose committee interviewed Kushner on Tuesday morning, said. “They don’t discuss at all, like, ‘Hey, Russia is interfering in our election. Should we talk to them about that?’ ”

In fact, Kushner never raised Russia’s meddling during his two post-election meetings with Russians, according to his own accounts. Kislyak contacted Kushner on November 16th, and they met on December 1st. Once again, the Russians seemed to have a level of access to the Trump campaign that other countries, including Western allies, could only dream of. In his testimony, Kushner confirmed that at this meeting, which took place in Trump Tower, he and Kislyak and Michael Flynn, the incoming national-security adviser, who also attended, discussed using communications equipment at the Russian Embassy. Kushner said the purpose was to relay information from Russian generals about Syria.

There was no skepticism about Russia or its actions in recent years from Kushner. But Kislyak was representing a leader who, as John Brennan, the former C.I.A. director, recently noted , “assaulted one of the foundational pillars of our democracy, our electoral system, that invaded Ukraine, annexed Crimea, that has suppressed and repressed political opponents in Russia and has caused the deaths of many of them.”

The Kushner-Kislyak relationship continued. On December 13th, at Kislyak’s urging, Kushner met with Sergey Gorkov, a Russian banker who is close to Putin. Again, what jumps out from Kushner’s account of the meeting is the easy access that the Russians had—“I agreed to meet Mr. Gorkov because the Ambassador has been so insistent,” and “said he had a direct relationship with” Putin, Kushner noted—and the obvious attempts to soften up Trump’ s closest aides and family members. Gorkov, whose bank, Vnesheconombank, was affected by the Obama Administration’s sanctions against Russia, brought Kushner a piece of art and a bag of dirt from Nvgorod, Belarus, where Kushner’s grandparents are from. Kushner insists that there were no real policies discussed at the meeting, which he said lasted less than a half hour.

As with his accounts of all the other interactions with Russians, Kushner claims he was simply a naïve staffer exchanging benign pleasantries. His professed innocence about the nature of these contacts may be the most troubling part of his testimony. The Russians were running a complex—and seemingly successful—campaign to gain access to Trump’s orbit, and the President-elect’s most trusted adviser claims he was clueless about what was actually going on. Kushner’s testimony does not reveal evidence of any crimes, but it does reveal a campaign and Presidential transition that were remarkably easy targets for Russian intelligence efforts.

“The Russians clearly thought they had reasons to believe this would be a friendly audience,” Hayden said. “If you’ve never seen a major-league curveball, you shouldn’t pretend you’re a major-leaguer.”"

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/trump-jr-and-why-spies-love-business,newyorker,"Trump, Jr., and Why Spies Love Business",[],"My grandmother’s close friend and, I later learned, occasional lover was, in the fullest sense of the phrase, an international man of mystery. He had a lavish apartment in Manhattan, across from Lincoln Center, and another in London, as well as homes in Israel and France, and he travelled from one to another, showing up suddenly and disappearing just as quickly. He told me sometimes about his impoverished childhood, in Lithuania and in New Jersey; it was never clear exactly how he had become wealthy. There was talk of “interests” in various firms, of lucky real-estate investments, of his time running the production company that made the James Bond films. Much later, not long before his death, in 2004, I learned the truth, revealed by documents unearthed after the fall of the Soviet Union: Joseph Katz was an important Soviet agent in New York and Europe in the nineteen-thirties and forties. His cover was running businesses that his Soviet bosses had created for him. He had a front company that manufactured gloves, another that owned parking lots, and a third that did importing and exporting.

I thought of Joe recently when I heard about the meeting between Donald Trump, Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort, and a group of Russian, British, and Georgian businesspeople, some of whom have connections to Russian intelligence. The meeting, which was held in Trump Tower, last June, was arranged by a pop star (whose billionaire father, a Russian real-estate mogul, had financed his career) and his British public-relations man, who, apparently, was happy to add international intrigue to his list of services. The guests included Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer who has represented the F.S.B., her country’s intelligence service, and Irakly Kaveladze, a financier who has been investigated by Congress for laundering Russian money through companies in Delaware. The ostensible agenda for the meeting ranged from the political (possible dirt on Hillary Clinton) to the financial (lifting American sanctions on Russian oligarchs and their companies).

In Joe’s time, there was a sharper distinction between business and espionage. Joe once wrote that he had “dreams of creating a better world.” His motivation was ideological, and his companies were a tool whose value—whose very existence—would disappear when Communism won. The meeting at Trump Tower is an example of the crude form of capitalism that ultimately triumphed in Russia. Now business is both goal and tool, inducement for coöperation and its reward.

“There’s a natural fit between business and intelligence,” Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a former C.I.A. operative who runs intelligence and defense projects at Harvard’s Kennedy School, told me. Spies carefully assess the commitments and vulnerabilities of potential sources; when camps are set up along moral lines, such as pro- and anti-Communist, it is difficult to move somebody from one to another. Businesspeople are less of a challenge. “Anytime you have money involved, it’s perfect for intelligence officers,” Mowatt-Larssen said.

This doesn’t mean that businesspeople are knowingly aiding foreign intelligence services for a few bucks. Rather, it suggests that it is far easier for spies to gather information when it comes out of a business relationship. Indeed, Russian intelligence has demonstrated something of an obsession with the real-estate and finance industries. Vince Houghton, the curator and historian at the International Spy Museum, in Washington, D.C., reminded me of the last major Russian spy scandal, in 2010, when the U.S. government arrested ten Russian agents living in America undercover. One, a woman born Anya Kushchenko but going by Anna Chapman, hid her activities behind her online real-estate startup. Another, Lidiya Guryev, who used the alias Cynthia Murphy, attended Columbia Business School and sought relationships in New York finance, particularly with Alan Patricof, a billionaire who co-chaired Hillary Clinton’s 2008 Presidential campaign. Guryev’s handlers in Moscow urged her “to build up relations little by little” with Patricof (she wasn’t successful); they also thanked her for uncovering details of the gold market.

The methods of today’s Russian spies are similar to those of their Soviet predecessors, with one significant difference. “To big-business types,” Houghton said, “the Soviets could not offer financial incentives worth their time.” Today, Russians “can offer incentives in the billions: ‘We’ll bring you into a Russian natural-gas consortium.’ ” A business deal can be an opportunity for profit as well as a lure into a murkier relationship.

Joe Katz ultimately rejected Soviet Communism, in part because of a K.G.B. purge of Jewish agents. He parlayed his front businesses into a profitable career, and into a life of good food, fine drink, and romantic liaisons. A recent article about him in Commentary revealed that Israeli intelligence and F.B.I. officials puzzled over this former Soviet agent: Was he loyal to Russia? To Israel? To America? What seems clear from Joe’s personal correspondence, collected in a moving book, “Letters to My Brother,” is that, for Joe, it was not an ideology that replaced Communism: it was money. ♦"
http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/stuart-hall-and-the-rise-of-cultural-studies,newyorker,Stuart Hall and the Rise of Cultural Studies,[],"In the summer of 1983, the Jamaican scholar Stuart Hall, who lived and taught in England, travelled to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, to deliver a series of lectures on something called “Cultural Studies.” At the time, many academics still considered the serious study of popular culture beneath them; a much starker division existed, then, between what Hall termed the “authenticated, validated” tastes of the upper classes and the unrefined culture of the masses. But Hall did not regard this hierarchy as useful. Culture, he argued, does not consist of what the educated élites happen to fancy, such as classical music or the fine arts. It is, simply, “experience lived, experience interpreted, experience defined.” And it can tell us things about the world, he believed, that more traditional studies of politics or economics alone could not.

A masterful orator, Hall energized the audience in Illinois, a group of thinkers and writers from around the world who had gathered for a summer institute devoted to parsing Marxist approaches to cultural analysis. A young scholar named Jennifer Daryl Slack believed she was witnessing something special and decided to tape and transcribe the lectures. After more than a decade of coaxing, Hall finally agreed to edit these transcripts for publication, a process that took years. The result is “ Cultural Studies 1983: A Theoretical History ,” which was published, last fall, as part of an ongoing Duke University Press series called “Stuart Hall: Selected Writings,” chronicling the career and influence of Hall, who died in 2014.

Broadly speaking, cultural studies is not one arm of the humanities so much as an attempt to use all of those arms at once. It emerged in England, in the nineteen-fifties and sixties, when scholars from working-class backgrounds, such as Richard Hoggart and Raymond Williams, began thinking about the distance between canonical cultural touchstones—the music or books that were supposed to teach you how to be civil and well-mannered—and their own upbringings. These scholars believed that the rise of mass communications and popular forms were permanently changing our relationship to power and authority, and to one another. There was no longer consensus. Hall was interested in the experience of being alive during such disruptive times. What is culture, he proposed, but an attempt to grasp at these changes, to wrap one’s head around what is newly possible?

Hall retained faith that culture was a site of “negotiation,” as he put it, a space of give and take where intended meanings could be short-circuited. “Popular culture is one of the sites where this struggle for and against a culture of the powerful is engaged: it is also the stake to be won or lost in that struggle,” he argues. “It is the arena of consent and resistance.” In a free society, culture does not answer to central, governmental dictates, but it nonetheless embodies an unconscious sense of the values we share, of what it means to be right or wrong. Over his career, Hall became fascinated with theories of “reception”—how we decode the different messages that culture is telling us, how culture helps us choose our own identities. He wasn’t merely interested in interpreting new forms, such as film or television, using the tools that scholars had previously brought to bear on literature. He was interested in understanding the various political, economic, or social forces that converged in these media. It wasn’t merely the content or the language of the nightly news, or middlebrow magazines, that told us what to think; it was also how they were structured, packaged, and distributed.

According to Slack and Lawrence Grossberg, the editors of “Cultural Studies 1983,” Hall was reluctant to publish these lectures because he feared they would be read as an all-purpose critical toolkit rather than a series of carefully situated historical conversations. Hall himself was ambivalent about what he perceived to be the American fetish for theory, a belief that intellectual work was merely, in Slack and Grossberg’s words, a “search for the right theory which, once found, would unlock the secrets of any social reality.” It wasn’t this simple. (I have found myself wondering what Hall would make of how cultural criticism of a sort that can read like ideological pattern-recognition has proliferated in the age of social media.)

Over the course of his lectures, Hall carefully wrestles with forebears, including the British scholar F. R. Leavis and also Williams and Hoggart (the latter founded Birmingham University’s influential Center for Contemporary Cultural Studies, which Hall directed in the seventies). Gradually, the lectures cluster around questions of how we give our lives meaning, how we recognize and understand “the culture we never see, the culture we don’t think of as cultivated.” These lectures aren’t instructions for “doing” cultural studies—until the very end, they barely touch on emerging cultural forms that intrigued Hall, such as reggae and punk rock. Instead, they try to show how far back these questions reach."

Is it a mirror or a music, a camera or a painting? Is it best designed for the long haul or for fine circular flights? Is it where we make a fetish of the perfect sentence, or a more relaxed religion of the appropriate form? Nabokov liked to dismiss writers who failed the Nabokovian sentence test, such as Camus, Mann, and Stendhal (who indeed likened the novel to a mirror). But the novelist ideally writes in paragraphs and chapters, not in sentences, as Woolf reminded her readers. Novelistic form, the accretion of many sentences, must find its own deeper, slower rhythm. In this regard, Iris Murdoch once divided the twentieth-century novel into the journalistic and the crystalline, and Woolf, the modernist aesthete who also loved Dickens and Scott and Tolstoy, couldn’t quite decide whether she liked her novels hospitably journalistic or stylishly crystalline. Like many of us, she wanted different pleasures from different novelists.

Joshua Cohen is an extraordinary prose stylist, surely one of the most prodigious at work in American fiction today. (And he is only thirty-six.) At his best, he resembles Saul Bellow: his sentences are all-season journeyers, able to do everything everywhere at once. He can be witty, slangy, lyrical, ironic, vivid; he possesses leaping powers of metaphor and analogy. Most writers develop certain talents at the expense of others, but Cohen relishes verbs as much as adjectives, metaphor-making as much as epigram-minting. Style is a patent priority: his fiction displays the stretch marks of its originality. In his new novel, “ Moving Kings ” (Random House), there are wonderfully strange verbs. In a cab: “The driver rancored away in Arabic, to himself or just a specter.” At a party: “A girl brisked over.” There are interesting new adjectives (or nouns turned into adjectives): “A hypermarket, a pharmacy, a dun huttish structure topped with a blinking red neon star.” And precise metaphorical descriptions, like this one of traffic in Queens: “He turned onto Northern Boulevard heading south. The cars seeped like spread tar and hardened into traffic.” Or the heat in Mexico: “The sun was sowing him a migraine.” But even when Cohen is not putting out his flags the prose is alert, tense with vitality. Here David King, newly arrived in Israel, prepares to meet his cousins: “The next morning, the second day—the day that God divided the sky from the waters below and so created the conditions for jetlag—David’s cousins were waiting in the lobby.”

Cohen is, in fact, a crystalline novelist with a journalistic openness to the world; his stylish sentences are loaded with the refuse of the real, with the facts, social data, and informational surplus of postmodernity. In this will to supreme combination, he resembles Thomas Pynchon (with Joyce the blessed progenitor), or David Foster Wallace. Cohen’s previous novel, the massive and massively ambitious “ Book of Numbers ” (2015), marched, in seven-league boots, over vast terrain: comparative theology, postmodern philosophy, questions of contemporary gender, the monstrous complacencies of the Internet age. As in Wallace’s work, there is a recognizable tension between the priority of style and the boisterous claims of the world, a tension as old as realism itself.

There are moments in Cohen’s work when his worldly omnivorousness (the desire to cover everything) and his stylistic talents (the desire to cover everything in the most brilliant style) seem to be running a race with each other. “Book of Numbers” was sometimes hard to read, not because it was incomprehensible or too demanding but because its textures were overwhelming, and because it struggled to find a form that could contain and focus those textures. Cohen’s natural inclination is toward a loquacious, storytelling largesse, but each of his sentences is also a micro-adventure in abundance. Here, in his new novel, he sketches some of the guys who work for David King’s company, King’s Moving. Each brief portrait is a stuffed pantechnicon:

Gyorgi had worked as a mover until he’d touched a female minor who’d clerked at a gypsum sheather in Paterson, served most of a lenient sentence, and was now confined behind a storage cage to be more findable by his parole officer. . . . Ronaldo Rodriguez, AKA Ronriguez, AKA Godriguez, AKA Burrito Ron, earned the last of his nicknames pioneering the technique of taking a customer’s odd loose possessions and rolling them up in a rug for efficiency of transport. He was a squat wide-assed low center of gravity surmounted by a slick pubic moustache. Malcom C, alias Talcum X, powdered his pits to stay dry and his hands to improve his grip. He was bullet bald and jacked, with two additional adductor muscles found in only .006% of the population.

“Moving Kings” also struggles with form, but this may represent a conscious effort on the author’s part at self-contraception. It is relatively brief (two hundred and forty pages), accessible, and more or less conventionally structured; it is highly intelligent but not a novel of ideas, and though its prose does plenty of swaggering, the swagger belongs to the characters—which is to say, most of the novel is written in close third-person or free indirect style, the grammar of everyday contemporary realism. It’s the right style for this novel’s world, which is burly with particularities and vibrant with voice. The atmosphere at times resembles a Jewish “Sopranos,” minus the violence—men, family, moneymaking, muscle. David King, the son of a Jewish immigrant and Holocaust survivor, reared in Queens, owns a successful moving company with storage facilities in all five boroughs. We first encounter him at a fancy fund-raiser in the Hamptons, where he stands out like a sweating cart horse among dry Arabians—bigger, coarser, burdened by work and apprehensions of work: “He moved among the servers who made $8.75 an hour and so who made about 14 cents, 14.5833 cents, he did the figures in his head, for each minute it took them to carve him primerib or fix him a scotch or direct him and his menthols to a smoking area.”

David King is recognizable enough, if not to the partygoers on Long Island: much less successful at life than at business; cocky, self-reliant, thinly cultured, wounded, comically poor in diet and karma. He has survived a heart attack, a pulverizing divorce from Bonnie, his Christian-convert wife—“Bonnie, the Fordham Road Albanian Orthodox who’d dipped in the mikveh and stepped out dripping for him”— and an affair with Ruth, his office manager. He has witnessed and waited out his daughter Tammy’s drug addiction and recovery, her graduation from N.Y.U. rewarded by the paternal gift of a brownstone in Crown Heights.

Until now, David’s Jewishness has been atavistically reflexive. He has visited Israel from time to time, but hasn’t given the country much concentrated thought, tending to liken its fate to his business prospects: if the core concern is strong, you don’t sweat the smaller stuff, which you can’t do much to influence anyway. That changes in the spring of 2015, after David’s heart attack. His cousin Dina e-mails to ask if he might host (and employ) her son, Yoav, who is finishing his national service in the Israeli Army. David responds from his convalescence in a way that seems forgivably sentimental, if also novelistically convenient. To have Israeli family in America, thinks David, is to have Israel in America: “If he’d stay in touch with Israel, if he’d maintain with Israel, certain responsibilities would devolve on the living after his demise. He was almost sure of it, he almost said it aloud: who among the living was going to shovel the dirt in his grave or say a kaddish? His daughter?”

A certain kind of Jewish novel would proceed to burn this familiar fuel: a father finds a substitute son, a religiously indolent American Jew renovates his ancient inheritance, the tough guy from Queens, getting older and sicker, softens up a bit. Cohen prepares the fire but proves nicely uninterested in the combustion. Wary of conventional payoffs, or even of conventional rises and falls, he likes to swerve away from a story or a character he has spent many pages establishing, in search of a fresh center of interest. The intermittency can be frustrating. As a novelist, he’s jittery, mobile, always on the prowl for new material, not so much easily distracted as easily consumed, quickly recentered. Once he has set up Yoav’s arrival and David’s soft patriarchal anticipation, he largely moves his focus away from David’s American scene and fills in, at some length, Yoav’s experiences as an Israeli soldier during the 2014 Gaza War."

http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/how-to-travel-like-a-millionaire-ask-the-points-guy,newyorker,How to Travel Like a Millionaire? Ask the Points Guy,[],"On a Wednesday afternoon in June, Brian Kelly, better known as the travel guru the Points Guy, left his office, on Park Avenue, and boarded a helicopter on East 34th Street. Six minutes after takeoff, he touched down at John F. Kennedy International Airport, and approximately seven minutes after that, with the help of his T.S.A. Pre status, he was through security and perched at the bar of a lounge inside Terminal 5. When I arrived, twenty minutes later, still flustered from maneuvering a rolling suitcase around a packed A train for the better part of an hour, he was sipping a complimentary glass of Sancerre and chatting up a male model he had ushered into the lounge with a guest pass.

Kelly has made a career out of flying first class around the world, subsidizing his trips with a seemingly endless supply of credit-card points and airline miles and, on his Web site, ThePointsGuy.com, advising his readers on how to do the same. His site, which attracts around four million readers a month, reviews first-class cabins and V.I.P. lounges, and breaks news about credit-card offers with enticing sign-up bonuses and rewards. Despite airlines’ reputation for uncouth treatment of passengers— dragging them off oversold planes , threatening jail time , forcing them to squeeze into skinny seats like so many chickens into a coop—Kelly insists that we’re actually in a “golden age” of travel. You just have to know how to game the system.

Maxim No. 1, Kelly says, is “get the right credit cards.” “Not only are the sign-up bonuses really high, the competition is so fierce,” he told me. The Points Guy is an avid collector—he currently has twenty credit cards, down from thirty. Credit-card companies also pay him now, via affiliate marketing—he gets a nominal fee when someone clicks through his Web site to apply for a card, which is explained in a disclaimer posted at the bottom of every ThePointsGuy.com page. (Last year, after reading the Points Guy’s iPhone app, my fiancé convinced me to get the Chase Sapphire Reserve card, which at the time came with a hundred-thousand-point sign-up bonus.) “I used to really worry, Am I a snake-oil salesman?” Kelly told me. “I’m asking people to get these financial products, but as long as you’re smart about it and pay your bill off in full—which, everyone knows, it’s your responsibility—I’ve never gotten a single e-mail that said, ‘I got points and I wasn’t able to use them.’ ”

While we were talking, a guy in a black leather jacket approached Kelly, roll-aboard trailing behind. “You’re the Points Guy, right?” he asked.

“Yeah! Hey, how’s it going?” Kelly replied.

“Thank you so much, man,” the guy said. “You got me into points so many years ago, and I just got in here,” he gestured around the lounge, rife with coveted electrical outlets and little bowls of Chex Mix. “Thanks a lot, I appreciate it.”

I asked Kelly what most people don’t know about maximizing their points. “Link your credit or debit card to shopping or dining programs,” he said. “The dining programs are crazy. Link your account, it takes two seconds, and, anytime you dine at a participating restaurant, you get points in your account in addition to the points on your credit card. It’s like double dipping.”

Then there are frequent-flier miles. “Last minute is the best time to use them,” he said. “Most people think you should redeem eleven months in advance, but that’s an old adage. The airlines now have better computer systems. Within the week of departure, or even the same day, tons of award seats— tons —the very best, open up. If you have a little bit of an appetite for risk, wait until the week of or a couple of days before.”

To prove it, Kelly whipped out his phone and pulled up the Alaska Airlines app. More tech savvy than many of its competitors, it allows users to search for award fares on partners such as Emirates, which has ultra-luxe amenities including functioning showers and an onboard bar. “Let’s go to Sydney—that’s always the hardest,” Kelly said, tapping his screen. “Right now, tonight, we could go economy for forty thousand miles and forty-one dollars. It’s nothing.”

Instead, we’re off to Los Angeles (home for me, meetings for Kelly—to brainstorm a possible Points Guy television show). He checked his watch and said, “We actually have to board.” He shrugged on a cardigan and sauntered to the men’s room. At six feet seven, he doesn’t do well in airplane lavatories. “I joke that that’s how I’m going to die, just a little bit of turbulence and. . . .” He mimed the side of his head crashing into a wall.

Kelly’s fascination with airfare deals started at the age of twelve, when his father, a pharmaceutical consultant, got a job at a California startup and asked Kelly, the family’s resident computer whiz, to book his flights back and forth from Philadelphia, where the family lived. Kelly would use Travelocity, which was new at the time. “I used to call it Travel-oh-city , because I had no idea,” Kelly said. “My dad paid me ten dollars per booking because he thought I had called the airline.”

In college, Kelly attained his own élite status and discovered FlyerTalk, an online forum of mileage-and-points enthusiasts. One of his first jobs after graduation was in human resources at Morgan Stanley, where he’d fly between colleges to recruit I.T. professionals. When the 2008 financial crisis hit, he took on an additional role: “Every time we had a major layoff, because I’m so tall, I’d wait outside in a suit to escort people to the lobby,” he told me. “It was miserable.” Many times a day, he’d soothe himself by checking his frequent-flier accounts.

In 2010, at the suggestion of friends, Kelly turned his hobby into a serviceable Web site. “At first, it was just a smart form—tell me your name, where you want to go, and how many miles you have,” he said. “I’d figure it out, like a crossword puzzle, and you’d pay me fifty dollars via PayPal. It was a little travel agency for points.” Kelly promoted the site on Facebook and began blogging about credit-card offers. One day, a college friend who worked at Chase asked him to meet for drinks. “I thought he was asking me out on a date, and I had no interest,” Kelly said. “Finally, we had a glass of wine in Times Square, and he said, ‘You’re the dumbest person I know. You’re direct linking to credit-card companies and they will pay a stupid amount of money for that.’ ”

During his first month of affiliate marketing, in February of 2011, Kelly made five thousand dollars. Two months later, he published a post about a hundred-thousand-point bonus offer from Chase and British Airways. Hundreds of readers applied for the card. He made thirty thousand dollars in twenty-four hours and gave notice at Morgan Stanley the next day. Today, his sway has grown so strong that many banks consult him before releasing new credit cards to the public. (Since 2012, the Points Guy has been owned by Bankrate, a consumer-finance company.)

We were somewhere above Ohio, noshing on taro chips and eggplant dip, by this point in Kelly’s origin story. He grew contemplative. “I’m a middle-class kid, my parents put me through college; I fully understand my privilege,” he said. The nature of his job— chastising a first-class lounge at a Chinese airport for using plastic cutlery instead of silverware—used to make him feel guilty. So, last year, he started Points for Peace , an initiative that partners with the nonprofit Peace Jam to fly Nobel laureates to children who might benefit from their guidance. “Everyone looks at charities, like, ‘Oh, they have too many administrative costs and travel,’ ” Kelly said. “I said, ‘What if I come in and help?’ ” Kelly now travels every few months for Peace Jam events in sub-Saharan Africa. Last June, in Ghana, he held a “Shark Tank”-style competition with three hundred and fifty teen-agers, awarding micro-finance loans to the most entrepreneurial of the group. He told me, “When I see talent, I want to develop it.”

Prior to boarding our JetBlue flight, Kelly received a text message from the airline’s publicist: Did he know that there was a thirteen-year-old boy in Pakistan marketing himself as the Points Guy, Jr., e-mailing various airlines, asking for free flights and discounts? Kelly did know. He had plans to meet the boy, Shailen Verma, in New York the following week, as part of a birthday present organized by Verma’s parents. On the plane, Kelly told me, “I’m going to sit him down and tell him how great it is that he’s enterprising, but he’s got to come up with a different name.”"
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/06/05/brush-clearing-with-teen-age-boys-in-arkansas,newyorker,Brush Clearing with Teen-Age Boys in Arkansas,"['Ellis Rosen', 'Ed Ruscha', 'Norman Rush']","In the summer of 1967, I took a job working for the Neighborhood Youth Corps in Little Rock. It was not a job I wanted—just one I could get. I was living in my mother’s apartment. She had assured me that I was welcome there. But I would need to work and bring in money if I meant to stay. I had worked at some job, been gainful at some mode of employment, every single day since I was twelve. Not to work, not to have a job, and to be idle was an unrecognized human state in my family. We were working people.

That summer I was twenty-three. I had a second-rate college degree. I’d just spent a difficult year teaching junior high and coaching baseball in inner-city Flint, Michigan. I was, I believed, spiritually “fatigued” and needing time to rest and reflect. I’d have been happy to stay home and read Flaubert. But that was not on offer, as the saying goes.

The name Neighborhood Youth Corps might summon up visions of clean-cut boys in spruce khaki uniforms, standing at attention on a parade ground while a government official reads a proclamation dispatching them to do what needs to be done for the good of all. The Corps may even have been intended to work that way when Lyndon Johnson made it a showcase program of the Great Society, by which poverty and social injustice would be eradicated from our land.

In Arkansas, however, the Neighborhood Youth Corps was a piñata from which those same government officials meant to get their mitts on a shower of federal dough, a laughably infinitesimal portion of which was earmarked to provide low-income (read: black) kids with “work experience,” which would—it was dearly hoped—keep them in school and out of the state’s hair. It was the summer of the Detroit riots and nine months before the murderous spring of ’68. Trouble was hotting up again in Dixie.

My job—to the extent that it could be defined—was to tutor twelve decidedly un-uniformed teen-age boys in the complex art of manual brush clearing, performed under the tormenting summer sun of central Yahoo. The state of Arkansas, it seemed, owned a lot of vacant land in Little Rock, which, surprisingly, it wasn’t using. Over time, this land had succumbed to sucker weeds and briars and red-brush saplings, all of which, it was determined, badly needed clearing. Or, at least, could be cleared—by someone. Use of the land wasn’t contemplated. Only clearing it. Much work done in the world is like this—virtually meaningless. Make-work.

Though not for me make-work. I was management—tasked and poorly paid to get down among ’em and impart the skills of swing-blade, of scythe, of axe and hatchet, of shovel and “come-along.” All things I knew about. My “men,” a dozen skinny black kids between sixteen and eighteen, took a skeptical view of how these lessons would be put into practice. They stood in a lank group around me, coolly observing me as I waded into the thickets and sweatily set the scythe or the sickle or some other vicious instrument into motion. I was demonstrating the skills. “See,” I said, looking fitfully up at them out of the dense bosk. “Make short strokes. Aim for the base of what you want to cut. Conserve your energy. Focus your efforts. Don’t flail. Be careful of who’s behind you.” (All sound advice for most occupations.) “Now,” I said, wiping stinging sweat out of my eyes and gaping. “Who’s ready to try it?” Hardly any of them were, a fact that they expressed by mutely continuing to watch me. One, sometimes two—the younger boys—would step forward as if their feet hurt, take whatever implement I was holding out to them, and merely stare at it, as though it were a weapon they were better off not having in their hands. Now and then, they’d try a tentative swipe with the blade or an awkward down-cut with the axe. Then they’d laugh and look around at their buddies, roll their eyes, and hand the job back to me for more demonstration.

These were not stupid boys. They weren’t being paid much, if anything. Only helped. The fact that I had a job that depended on them and was intended to keep them out of mischief and assure social justice and cure poverty conferred no mission on their lives. At their tender ages, they had already seen things—many things—that I hadn’t. They recognized hard, pointless, idiotic toil when they saw it. Possibly their fathers were practicing it that same hot summer day. All of it might come to them soon enough. But, until then, this was fine work for me to do.

And in that way the summer of ’67 passed: with me down in the underbrush, showing these black kids how work was done, while they calmly looked on, waiting for their futures to arrive. ♦

He wasn’t happy. Earlier in the night, I’d tweeted , citing a “senior White House official,” that Scaramucci was having dinner at the White House with President Trump, the First Lady, Sean Hannity, and the former Fox News executive Bill Shine. It was an interesting group, and raised some questions. Was Trump getting strategic advice from Hannity? Was he considering hiring Shine? But Scaramucci had his own question—for me.

“Who leaked that to you?” he asked. I said I couldn’t give him that information. He responded by threatening to fire the entire White House communications staff. “What I’m going to do is, I will eliminate everyone in the comms team and we’ll start over,” he said. I laughed, not sure if he really believed that such a threat would convince a journalist to reveal a source. He continued to press me and complain about the staff he’s inherited in his new job. “I ask these guys not to leak anything and they can’t help themselves,” he said. “You’re an American citizen, this is a major catastrophe for the American country. So I’m asking you as an American patriot to give me a sense of who leaked it.”

In Scaramucci’s view, the fact that word of the dinner had reached a reporter was evidence that his rivals in the West Wing, particularly Reince Priebus , the White House chief of staff, were plotting against him. While they have publicly maintained that there is no bad blood between them, Scaramucci and Priebus have been feuding for months. After the election, Trump asked Scaramucci to join his Administration, and Scaramucci sold his company, SkyBridge Capital, in anticipation of taking on a senior role. But Priebus didn’t want him in the White House, and successfully blocked him from being appointed to a job until last week, when Trump offered him the communications job over Priebus’s vehement objections. In response to Scaramucci’s appointment, Sean Spicer, an ally of Priebus’s, resigned his position as press secretary. And in an additional slight to Priebus, the White House’s official announcement of Scaramucci’s hiring noted that he would report directly to the President, rather than to the chief of staff.

Scaramucci’s first public appearance as communications director was a slick and conciliatory performance at the lectern in the White House briefing room last Friday. He suggested it was time for the White House to turn a page. But since then, he has become obsessed with leaks and threatened to fire staffers if he discovers that they have given unauthorized information to reporters. Michael Short, a White House press aide considered close to Priebus, resigned on Tuesday after Scaramucci publicly spoke about firing him. Meanwhile, several damaging stories about Scaramucci have appeared in the press, and he blamed Priebus for most of them. Now, he wanted to know whom I had been talking to about his dinner with the President. Scaramucci, who initiated the call, did not ask for the conversation to be off the record or on background.

“Is it an assistant to the President?” he asked. I again told him I couldn’t say. “O.K., I’m going to fire every one of them, and then you haven’t protected anybody, so the entire place will be fired over the next two weeks.”

I asked him why it was so important for the dinner to be kept a secret. Surely, I said, it would become public at some point. “I’ve asked people not to leak things for a period of time and give me a honeymoon period,” he said. “They won’t do it.” He was getting more and more worked up, and he eventually convinced himself that Priebus was my source.

“They’ll all be fired by me,” he said. “I fired one guy the other day. I have three to four people I’ll fire tomorrow. I’ll get to the person who leaked that to you. Reince Priebus—if you want to leak something—he’ll be asked to resign very shortly.” The issue, he said, was that he believed Priebus had been worried about the dinner because he hadn’t been invited. “Reince is a fucking paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac,” Scaramucci said. He channelled Priebus as he spoke: “ ‘Oh, Bill Shine is coming in. Let me leak the fucking thing and see if I can cock-block these people the way I cock-blocked Scaramucci for six months.’ ” (Priebus did not respond to a request for comment.)

Scaramucci was particularly incensed by a Politico report about his financial-disclosure form, which he viewed as an illegal act of retaliation by Priebus. The reporter said Thursday morning that the document was publicly available and she had obtained it from the Export-Import Bank. Scaramucci didn’t know this at the time, and he insisted to me that Priebus had leaked the document, and that the act was “a felony.”

“I’ve called the F.B.I. and the Department of Justice,” he told me.

“Are you serious?” I asked.

“The swamp will not defeat him,” he said, breaking into the third person. “They’re trying to resist me, but it’s not going to work. I’ve done nothing wrong on my financial disclosures, so they’re going to have to go fuck themselves.”

Scaramucci also told me that, unlike other senior officials, he had no interest in media attention. “I’m not Steve Bannon, I’m not trying to suck my own cock,” he said, speaking of Trump’s chief strategist. “I’m not trying to build my own brand off the fucking strength of the President. I’m here to serve the country.” (Bannon declined to comment.)

He reiterated that Priebus would resign soon, and he noted that he told Trump that he expected Priebus to launch a campaign against him. “He didn’t get the hint that I was reporting directly to the President,” he said. “And I said to the President here are the four or five things that he will do to me.” His list of allegations included leaking the Hannity dinner and the details from his financial-disclosure form.

I got the sense that Scaramucci’s campaign against leakers flows from his intense loyalty to Trump . Unlike other Trump advisers, I’ve never heard him say a bad word about the President. “What I want to do is I want to fucking kill all the leakers and I want to get the President’s agenda on track so we can succeed for the American people,” he told me.

He cryptically suggested that he had more information about White House aides. “O.K., the Mooch showed up a week ago,” he said. “This is going to get cleaned up very shortly, O.K.? Because I nailed these guys. I’ve got digital fingerprints on everything they’ve done through the F.B.I. and the fucking Department of Justice.”

“What?” I interjected.

“Well, the felony, they’re gonna get prosecuted, probably, for the felony.” He added, “The lie detector starts—” but then he changed the subject and returned to what he thought was the illegal leak of his financial-disclosure forms. I asked if the President knew all of this.

“Well, he doesn’t know the extent of all that, he knows about some of that, but he’ll know about the rest of it first thing tomorrow morning when I see him.”

Scaramucci said he had to get going. “Yeah, let me go, though, because I’ve gotta start tweeting some shit to make this guy crazy.”

Minutes later, he tweeted, “In light of the leak of my financial info which is a felony. I will be contacting @FBI and the @TheJusticeDept #swamp @Reince45.” With the addition of Priebus’s Twitter handle, he was making public what he had just told me: that he believed Priebus was leaking information about him. The tweet quickly went viral.

Scaramucci seemed to have second thoughts. Within two hours he deleted the original tweet and posted a new one denying that he was targeting the chief of staff. “Wrong!” he said, adding a screenshot of an Axios article that said, “Scaramucci appears to want Priebus investigated by FBI.” Scaramucci continued, “Tweet was public notice to leakers that all Sr Adm officials are helping to end illegal leaks. @Reince45.”

A few hours later, I appeared on CNN to discuss the overnight drama. As I was talking about Scaramucci, he called into the show himself and referenced our conversation. He changed his story about Priebus. Instead of saying that he was trying to expose Priebus as a leaker, he said that the reason he mentioned Priebus in his deleted tweet was because he wanted to work together with Priebus to discover the leakers.

“He’s the chief of staff, he’s responsible for understanding and uncovering and helping me do that inside the White House, which is why I put that tweet out last night,” Scaramucci said , after noting that he had talked to me Wednesday night. He then made an argument that journalists were assuming that he was accusing Priebus because they know Priebus leaks to the press.

“When I put out a tweet, and I put Reince’s name in the tweet,” he said, “they’re all making the assumption that it’s him because journalists know who the leakers are. So, if Reince wants to explain that he’s not a leaker, let him do that.”

Scaramucci then made a plea to viewers. “Let me tell you something about myself,” he said. “I am a straight shooter.”

How apropos for our yellow-haired queen of mayhem. “On a night like this, you came into the world,” Tyrion says. He, Varys, Daenerys, Grey Worm, and Missandei are in the Map Room, looking like a bunch of evil geniuses. Dragonstone is quite something: cavelike walls, torch sconces, ghastly, eye-socket-like windows overlooking the dark seas. There’s a map-covered table dotted with chess-type pieces—“not so many lions,” Dany says, meaning the Lannisters. The Queen and her advisers have a bracing chat. Sure, they could take Westeros, with their dragons and whatnot—but to what end? “You’re not here to be queen of the ashes,” Tyrion says. They talk about transparency, trust, and the nature of government. Dany tells Varys to promise that if he wants to criticize her, he should do it to her face, not behind her back. He swears it.

“If you ever betray me, I’ll burn you alive,” she says.

“I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons,” he says. These two! The moment is ruined by the arrival of—ugh!—Melisandre. She tries to butter up Dany with the “I used to be a slave” routine, then starts talking about the Lord of Light’s prophecies about who will bring the dawn (ugh again) and then moves on to Jon Snow. Now you’re talking!

“He sounds like quite a man,” Dany says. Oh, he is.

Tyrion pipes up. “I can’t speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow, and I trusted him. And I’m an excellent judge of character,” he says. They send Jon an invitation raven.

At Winterfell, the courtyard is once again being used for combat practice below and strategizing above. Jon Snow and Sansa are reading letters. Ah, a letter from Tyrion! These Season 7 episodes are moving along briskly, as are the mails.

Meanwhile, at Cersei’s, things are a bit more . . . intense. In her fiery throne room, she’s talking to a crowd, including some bannermen of House Tyrell, about rape, murder, butchering, Lady Olenna, the Mad King, and Dany, in a highly unflattering manner. Spin, one might call it. Jaime is smirking a little. Look how happy she is, he’s thinking. She deserves this. The people listening seem slightly less psyched. In a corridor, Jaime tries to get Samwell Tarly’s dad, Randyll Tarly, to pledge his loyalty to the Lannister side of things, which would include fighting Olenna Tyrell’s people. “I’m a Tarly,” Tarly says. “I swore an oath to House Tyrell. I’ve known Olenna since I was a child.” Jaime isn’t having it. “She brought the Dothraki to our shores!” he says. “Do you fight with us, or with the foreign savages and eunuchs?” I’ve come to love Jaime, but his vision of government has limited appeal. He tries to sweet-talk him: “When the war is won, the Queen will need a new Warden of the South,” he says, practically wiggling his eyebrows.

At the Citadel, Tarly the younger is looking depressed: the man whose horrible Greyscaled arm he discovered last week has only six months to live, Archmaester Jim Broadbent tells him. Sam looks even more flummoxed when the maester pooh-poohs his medical advice—and further still when he discovers the patient’s identity. “Mormont!” Sam says. He might be thinking, This guy’s dad saved me from a wight in Season 3 ! Now I will save him from the Crud That Cannot Be Scraped Off.

At King’s Landing, Cersei is looking pleased in the Lair of Dragon Skulls. Wait till she sees Dragonstone—if she wins this shebang, perhaps she can use it as a summer house. Her trusty aide Qyburn, who made Jaime’s prosthetic hand, among other medical and murderous innovations, has rigged up what he hopes is a good dragon-shooter: a giant crossbow. Cersei optimistically fires it at a dragon skull, and seems to wound it.

At Dragonstone, the party is really getting off the ground. Guests include the better Greyjoys, Yara and Theon, and the whole Dorne contingent—Ellaria Sand, some Sand Snakes, and dear old Olenna Tyrell. They are in town and fired up ! What do they want? War! When do they want it? Now! Our team has got boats and dragons, let’s do this. It will be a cinch! “I am not here to be queen of the ashes,” Dany says, sagely. Tyrion, moving some pieces around the map, says that they won’t appeal to their enemies’ nationalism by having the Unsullied storm the capital: they will have the Greyjoys and the Dornish and Tyrell armies do it. (How convenient, Lady Olenna says.) Tyrion proposes that Grey Worm and the Unsullied capture the Lannisters’ true seat of power, Casterly Rock. Everybody eventually agrees to this. Lady Olenna is still wearing her adorable hat and veil, and dispensing wise, cranky wisdom like there’s no tomorrow. “May I speak with you alone?” Dany asks Olenna. She scoffs at Cersei, at the concept of peace, and at Tyrion. “Clever men—I outlive them all. You know why? I ignore them,” she says. “Are you a sheep? No. You’re a dragon. Be a dragon.” Every show should have a Lady Olenna/Dowager Countess figure. Every life should have one, in fact. I am currently accepting applications.

The next scene, unexpectedly, begins as a tender, wounded goodbye between Grey Worm, who’s off to capture the true seat of power, and Missandei—“You are my weakness,” he says—and abruptly turns into perhaps the hottest eunuch sex scene of all time. They kiss; she boldly disrobes; he is worried about his pants area; she isn’t; they move to the bed, toned and lit by torchlight; and the scene takes a satisfyingly Jane Campion-ish direction, in which women’s rights are fully respected. Just before the apex of things, the scene cuts to a library bookshelf, and a hand unshelving a book. Oh, yeah .

That book means that Sam Tarly is at it again. He goes to Jorah Mormont’s room with a cart of secret potions, introduces himself properly, and announces that he’ll be trying out an experimental Greyscale procedure few else would attempt. “Please try not to scream,” he says kindly, giving Jorah something to bite on and getting out his knives and pastes. Dr. Tarly is in!

Arya continues to eat her way across Westeros, heading to King’s Landing. At a pub, she runs into her old friend Hot Pie, and they compare crust-making techniques. “You’ve been making pies,” he says.

“One or two,” she says. He gossips: he’s seen Brienne of Tarth, looking to defend Starks; the great Sept went “boom”; Jon Snow is King in the North; Winterfell is back , baby, and the Boltons are dead. Arya nearly chokes on her buttered crust and gets up. Plans have changed! “You’re pretty,” Hot Pie says. Aw, Hot Pie.

“Take care of yourself, Hot Pie,” she says. “Try not to get killed.”

Jon Snow gets a letter from the Citadel. Why, it’s from Samwell Tarly! Back at the hall of guys, he excitedly hollers the news: Dragonstone is full of dragonglass! He also says that Tyrion is at Dragonstone with Dany, and that they’ve just invited him for a visit, and that they’ve got dragons. He wants to go; nobody else wants him to. “We need to mine it and turn it into weapons!” he says. So far, he’s yelled about mining in two consecutive episodes, and I’m not sure I’m on board for a big mining story line. They also need allies, Jon says. The plan is controversial. Sansa protests that the Mad King roasted their grandfather alive. The hoary old guys are freaking out; even wise little Lyanna Mormont is not on board. Too bad, Jon says. I’m out of here, and Sansa’s in charge. With this she cannot argue. Afterward, Jon Snow and Littlefinger have a whisper fight in front of a statue of Ned Stark, in which Littlefinger tries to ingratiate himself. “I love Sansa and I loved her mother,” Littlefinger whispers.

Jon whips around and thrusts him against the wall. “Touch Sansa and I’ll kill you myself,” he says. Brothers don’t like that kind of talk, Littlefinger, you clown.

Soon, we see him departing on horseback, exchanging a little Jaime-and-Brienne-style wave with Sansa as he trots away.

Arya is in the woods at a fire, alone with her horse, no Ed Sheerans in sight. Perhaps in her head she’s singing that little tune he sang last week. Her horse is freaking out—kind of dancing around—and suddenly there’s an intense wolf-pack situation happening. And then: a giant dog appears, apparently Arya’s long-lost direwolf, who has gone off and started a whole new life in the woods. “Nymeria?” she says. “Nymeria, it’s me.” Nymeria plays it cool. “I’m heading north, girl, back to Winterfell. I’m finally heading home. Come with me.” Nymeria turns away, wanting to stay wild. “It’s not you,” Arya says, echoing a line she’d once said about her own nature. I’m hoping Nymeria is taking mental notes and returns to rip some bad guys’ faces off at some later opportune moment.

In the belly of the Greyjoys’ ship, Theon is looking grim, like he wishes he didn’t have to listen to his sister and Ellaria Sand flirt. Well, he doesn’t for long—there’s an attack! Who should it be but their demented Uncle Euron. The camera cuts to a huge Eeevil thing that approaches with the vibe and ominous music of the ghost ship in “Pirates of the Caribbean,” and Euron, continuing to be an evil madcap, ta-da!s his way on deck via viper-faced drawbridge, hacking his way around in a barrage of grunting, eyeliner, facial hair, and excitement. He laughs; Theon looks more stressed out, and may be morphing back into Reek. Fight fight fight fight fight.

Ships aflame, Greyjoy fleets shrinking. Fire, hatchets—this reminds me of a new bar in New Jersey that I keep hearing about. Euron kills one of the Sand Snakes; it’s what we call an exciting lesser battle, in which characters you don’t particularly like kill characters you don’t care much about, and threaten ones you do. Euron, to his credit, smiles when he fights. I don’t like fighting, but I do like smiling. Yara holds her own with Uncle Euron, jumping on him from a height and getting in some good rage thwacking, but he bests her. As Euron seems poised to kill Yara in front of Theon, Theon, rather than doing anything swashbuckling, trembles, looks pained, and jumps overboard. Euron laughs—O.K., Euron, I’ve changed my mind. Enough laughing! He disappears with Yara, and he’s got her by the throat.

Theon has rediscovered his inner Reek, all right, and Reek is in the water. What’s his plan? I’m not sure he’s sure, either. But he’s in a pickle. Yes, he seems to be panicking, and he could drown. He’s surrounded by flaming ships and hanging corpses. But he’s sensitive, so don’t rule him out. Sometimes the sensitive types can surprise you. He could join the ranks of the Mysteriously Offscreen. Or he could drown. One thing is clear: when word gets back to Dragonstone, Tyrion is going to have to rearrange some chess pieces in the Map Room."
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/10/01/mugglemarch,newyorker,J. K. Rowling’s Novel for Adults,[],"The conifer hedges in front of J. K. Rowling’s seventeenth-century house, in Edinburgh, are about twenty feet tall. They reach higher than the street lamps in front of them, and evoke the entrance to the spiteful maze in the film adaptation of “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,” the fourth volume of her fantasy series. Rowling, who, at forty-seven, is about to publish her first novel for adults—it is set in a contemporary Britain familiar with Jay-Z and online pornography, but is shaded with memories of her own, quite cheerless upbringing—lives here with her second husband, Neil Murray, a doctor, and their children. She has a reputation for reserve: for being likable but shy and thin-skinned, and not at all comfortable with the personal impact of having created a modern myth, sold four hundred and fifty million books, and inspired more than six hundred thousand pieces of Harry Potter fan fiction, a total that increases by at least a thousand stories a week. Ian Rankin, the writer of Edinburgh-based crime novels, became friendly with Joanne Rowling when they were neighbors in another part of the city; he recently described her as “quite quiet, quite introspective.” He recalled urging Rowling to join him for an onstage interview at the Edinburgh International Book Festival, a few years ago. After Rowling watched Rankin being interviewed at a similar event, she told him, “I don’t think I can do that.” Rankin said, “I think she feels uncomfortable in a room full of adults. I’ve seen her in a room of kids, and she’s in her element.” Rankin noted that Rowling, in her writing, retains “the power of life and death over these characters.” She is wary “of situations you can’t always control—in the real world.” In the spring, nearly five years after the appearance of the seventh, and final, Harry Potter novel, Little, Brown, Rowling’s publisher, announced “The Casual Vacancy,” and offered a glimpse of the plot: an idyllic English town named Pagford; the death of a man named Barry; a parish-council election. In response, a British publisher announced “The Vacant Casualty,” billed as a parody, if one can parody something whose contents are unknown. Commenters on the Guardian ’ s Web site guessed at Rowling’s likely models, with reference to Robertson Davies and “Desperate Housewives.” One reader, playing on Rowling’s word for non-wizard society, suggested an alternate title: “Mugglemarch.” And the hosts of Pottercast, a popular American fan podcast, picked over the press release, registering both delight at fresh data—Rowling has written ten tweets in three years—and a hint of worry that an extraordinary global bond between an author and her readers, and between two generations, was about to be severed. They were opening an invitation to a party where they might not be quite welcome. During the podcast, they looked up “parish council” on Wikipedia, and established that the term refers to the lowest rung of English local government. One of the hosts, Melissa Anelli—a thirty-two-year-old who runs a Potter Web site, stages an annual Potter convention, and has published a sharp-witted book about Potter enthusiasts—pondered the title, asking, “What’s casual, ever, about a vacancy?” She and her co-hosts wondered whether they’d go to a midnight party to celebrate the book’s launch, as many fans had for the later Potter novels. In Britain, Ian Rankin typically publishes a new novel in October, and it tends to go to the top of the best-seller list. He said that, this year, his publisher moved the date to November, fearing that the late-September launch of “The Casual Vacancy” will, for weeks, render all other fiction invisible to readers and to the media. Rankin was taken aback but glad for the extra writing time. He wondered if “The Casual Vacancy” might have a whodunnit air; Rowling has talked to him of her admiration for British crime writing of the nineteen-twenties and thirties. “She loves Margery Allingham and Dorothy L. Sayers,” he said, adding that the Pagford setting had relieved him of his greatest fear: that Rowling had been working on a crime novel set in Edinburgh. He said, “I hope she’ll create an English village that she will know intimately—and it will be real to us.”

“I have drawn a map of Pagford,” Rowling told me when we met, in late August. “It’s one of the first things I did.” We were not speaking in her Edinburgh house, or at her country place—which stands in grassland, overlooking a fast-running river in a valley north of the city—or in her home in an expensive part of west London. We were at her office, which occupies an unmarked Georgian building on a handsome street in central Edinburgh, not too far from a café that, in mockery of competitors, has hung a sign that reads “ J. K. ROWLING NEVER WROTE HERE. ” The office has high ceilings, Turkish rugs over wooden floors, figurative oil paintings by modern Scottish artists, and the air of a small but very well-funded embassy. According to the London Sunday Times , Rowling is worth nine hundred million dollars. An assistant had shown me to a front room on the parlor floor. Rowling was sitting at the head of a polished table, with a cup of black coffee and a newspaper; as I entered, she took off large black-framed glasses. She was slight, with her blond hair pulled back, and her V-necked sweater was pushed up at the sleeves to show freckled arms. She appeared to be wearing false eyelashes and rather heavy foundation. We talked at that table, and—after a brief, rainy walk—in the lounge of a nearby hotel. There was a stiffness to the transaction, but she was not unfriendly; she laughed now and then, and was clearly pleased to be able to talk about her book. It had been fourteen years, she calculated, since she’d been interviewed by someone who’d read the imminent novel. Once the Potter series had taken off, her representatives kept unflinching watch over Rowling’s words, in order to enhance the drama of synchronized international releases, and to help suppress piracy. (It was in this context that, in 2005, a British security guard who had stolen two copies of “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince” from a book-distribution center fired a gun during negotiations to sell a copy to a reporter from the Sun .) Her writing life was oddly self-contained, even if, by the end of the Potter series, she was receiving between one and two thousand pieces of mail a week. Rowling does not widely distribute her unpublished manuscripts, and her publishers seem to have processed them with little intervention. (Neil Blair, her agent, told me, “She takes a lot of time getting it right and then hands in a book that doesn’t need much editing.”) A few years ago, in a conversation with Melissa Anelli, the podcast host, Rowling criticized herself for not quite finishing “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.” “I didn’t do the final edit that I normally do before I hand it to the editors, and it definitely shows,” she said, sounding almost like a self-published author. In 2007, more than twenty-five million copies of “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows” were printed, in the first edition, and Rowling estimated that only seven people in the world, including her British agent and her editors in New York and London, had read the novel before stores began selling it. I asked her if publishing the new book made her feel exposed. “I thought I’d feel frightened at this point,” she said. “Not just because it’s been five years, and anything I wrote after Potter— anything —was going to receive a certain degree of attention that is not entirely welcome, if I’m honest. It’s not the place I’m happiest or most comfortable, shall we say. So, for the first few years of writing ‘The Casual Vacancy,’ I kept saying to myself, ‘You’re very lucky. You can pay your bills, you don’t have to publish it.’ And that was a very freeing thought, even though I knew bloody well, in my heart of hearts, that I was going to publish it. I knew that a writer generally writes to be read, unless you’re Salinger.” After all the fretting—“Christ, you’re going to have to go out there again”—she discovered that she was calm. “I think I’ve spent so long with the book—it is what I want it to be,” she said. “You think, Well, I did the best I could where I was with what I had.” She laughed. “Which is a terrible paraphrase of a Theodore Roosevelt quote.” In the decade or so after A. A. Milne published the “Winnie-the-Pooh” books, in the nineteen-twenties, he wrote several plays and novels for adults, as well as an autobiography in which he expanded on a thought expressed by a character in an Arnold Bennett play: that the artist who has early success with a painting of a policeman is expected to paint policemen forever. Milne wrote, “If you stop painting policemen in order to paint windmills, criticism remains so overpoweringly policeman-conscious that even a windmill is seen as something with arms out, obviously directing the traffic.” He added, “As a discerning critic pointed out: the hero of my latest play, God help it, was ‘just Christopher Robin grown up.’ So that even when I stop writing about children, I still insist on writing about people who were children once.” I read “The Casual Vacancy,” which is five hundred and twelve pages long, in the New York offices of Little, Brown, after signing a non-disclosure agreement whose first draft—later revised—had prohibited me from taking notes. (With this book, Rowling was hoping for a “more run-of-the-mill publishing experience,” but that hope goes only so far.) Within a few pages, it was clear that the novel had not been written for children: “The leathery skin of her upper cleavage radiated little cracks that no longer vanished when decompressed.” A little later, a lustful boy sits on a school bus “with an ache in his heart and in his balls.” But reviewers looking for echoes of the Harry Potter series will find them. “The Casual Vacancy” describes young people coming of age in a place divided by warring factions, and the deceased council member, Barry Fairbrother—who dies in the first chapter but remains the story’s moral center—had the same virtues, in his world, that Harry had in his: tolerance, constancy, a willingness to act. “I think there is a through-line,” Rowling said. “Mortality, morality, the two things that I obsess about.” “The Casual Vacancy” is not a whodunnit but, rather, a rural comedy of manners that, having taken on state-of-the-nation social themes, builds into black melodrama. Its attention rotates among several Pagford households, in the Southwest of England: a gourmet-grocery owner and his wife; two doctors; a nurse married to a printer; a social worker. Most of the families include troubled teens. Barry’s civic influence is revealed by his departure, rather as George Bailey’s is in “It’s a Wonderful Life.” The story is driven by the long-standing frustration that some of Barry’s disagreeable and right-wing neighbors have about the town’s administrative connection to the Fields, an area of public housing and poverty on the edge of a larger, nearby town. Historically, children from the Fields have had the right to attend primary school in Pagford, a place of flower baskets and other middle-class comforts, and the town has also supported a drug-treatment clinic that serves the neighborhood. In the absence of Barry’s righteous influence, the anti-Fields faction sees an opportunity to rid Pagford of this burden. This is a story of class warfare set amid semi-rural poverty, heroin addiction, and teen-age perplexity and sexuality. It may be a while before we’re accustomed to reading phrases like “that miraculously unguarded vagina” in a Rowling book, and public response to “The Casual Vacancy” will doubtless include scandalized objections to the idea of young Harry Potter readers being drawn into such material. “There is no part of me that feels that I represented myself as your children’s babysitter or their teacher,” Rowling said. “I was always, I think, completely honest. I’m a writer, and I will write what I want to write.” She was ready for a change of genre. “I had a lot of real-world material in me, believe you me,” Rowling said. “The thing about fantasy—there are certain things you just don’t do in fantasy. You don’t have sex near unicorns. It’s an ironclad rule. It’s tacky.” She then added, carefully, “It’s not that I just wanted to write about people having sex.” Rather, she began with the idea of writing about a local election, which gave her a “rush of adrenaline.” The Harry Potter series had an alluring creation story, known to all fans: in 1990, on a delayed train between Manchester and London, Rowling was overwhelmed by the thought of a boy who learns, at the age of eleven, that he is a wizard. The idea for “The Casual Vacancy” also came to Rowling while she was travelling, but this time she was on a private plane, touring America to promote “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.” “It’s been billed, slightly, as a black comedy, but to me it’s more of a comic tragedy,” she said. If the novel had precedents, “it would be sort of nineteenth-century: the anatomy and the analysis of a very small and closed society.” A local election was “a perfect way in,” she said. “It’s the smallest possible building block of democracy—this tiny atom on which everything rests.” One could say that national politics does not rest upon local politics, and that no modern British town is a closed society; some of Rowling’s characters may seem eccentric for the earnestness with which they regard a local election. She acknowledged that the scale of parish-council decision-making is “easy to laugh at” but said that “part of the point is that those decisions that are being made do dramatically affect people’s lives, up to life and death sometimes.” She said, “In my head, the working title for a long time was ‘Responsible,’ because for me this is a book about responsibility. In the minor sense—how responsible we are for our own personal happiness, and where we find ourselves in life—but in the macro sense also, of course: how responsible we are for the poor, the disadvantaged, other people’s misery.” Two years in, she picked up the standard British handbook for local administrators. “I needed it to check certain abstruse points. And in there I came across the phrase ‘a casual vacancy.’ Meaning, when a seat falls vacant through death or scandal. And immediately I knew that that was the title. . . . I was dealing not only with responsibility but with a bunch of characters who all have these little vacancies in their lives, these emptinesses in their lives, that they’re all filling in various ways.” She added, with some passion, “And it’s death! The casual vacancy, the casualness with which death comes down. You expect a fanfare, you expect some sort of pathos or grandeur to it. And, you know, the first big death I ever suffered was my mother’s, and it was that that was so shocking: just gone.”

Rowling is not a recluse: she read at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics; she was Harvard’s commencement speaker in 2008; she appeared in a television documentary about her family tree. But she is not a part of everyday British cultural life. (“I’m not a natural joiner,” she told me.) Her nonfiction canon adds up to just a few thousand words, and includes a single book review—she praised the letters of Jessica Mitford, the British writer and left-wing activist, for whom Rowling’s older daughter is named—and a short essay in a collection of speeches by Gordon Brown, the former Labour Prime Minister, whom she admires, and whose wife, Sarah Brown, is a friend. She has given limited access to her personal history, and in interviews has tended to strike the same few notes: a friend in her teen-age years who freed the two of them by having access to a Ford Anglia, the same car driven by Ron Weasley, Harry Potter’s friend; the train ride that delivered Harry to her; a difficult period, in the nineties, as a single mother. Last year, Lifetime constructed a biopic out of these fragments, filling the gaps with surreally misjudged approximations of a middle-class West Country childhood in the sixties and seventies: in the film, Rowling’s secondary school has exposed timber beams, and people say “I love you” at the end of phone calls. Rowling’s father was an engineer at the Rolls-Royce aircraft-engine plant in Bristol, and Rowling and her younger sister, Dianne, spent their earliest years in villages just outside that city, which is two hours west of London. When Joanne was nine, the family moved a little farther west, to the edge of the Forest of Dean, a more rural and less prosperous district. Neither of Rowling’s parents went to college, but her mother’s family was solidly middle class and educated; Joanne’s great-aunt Ivy was a classics teacher, and she introduced Joanne to Mitford’s writing. The Rowlings now lived in a handsome Gothic Revival cottage, by a church, in the village of Tutshill. “My voice wasn’t Forest of Dean, although it became Forest of Dean, believe you me, pretty damn quickly,” Rowling said. Her accent is still subtly flexible, and at one point in our conversation she exclaimed like a Scot: “Och!” She said that, after the family’s twenty-mile move, “I always felt an outsider.” There’s a resentfully uprooted teen-age Londoner in “The Casual Vacancy,” and Rowling volunteered that this is a partial self-portrait. Unlike other members of her family, Rowling regularly attended services in the church next door. At eleven, she enrolled at Wyedean, a new secondary school. Her mother—a woman of French and Scottish heritage with a smile that was slightly skewed, like her daughter’s—later worked in the school, as a technician in the science department. Steve Eddy, who taught Rowling English when she first arrived, and has since become a writer with an interest in mythology and astrology, remembers Joanne as “not exceptional” but “one of a group of girls who were bright, and quite good at English.” Referring to Harry Potter’s bookish friend, he said, “I suppose you could say she was a bit Hermione-like. I’d ask a question, and some hands would shoot up, and she was definitely one of the group.” He recalled that the class read Stan Barstow’s “Joby”—a realist story about a working-class Northern boy—as well as “The Weirdstone of Brisingamen,” by Alan Garner (a wizard, dwarfs, witches), and “A Wizard of Earthsea,” by Ursula K. Le Guin, whose hero attends a school for wizards. Eddy said that Rowling, when writing stories, was much more likely than other students to produce fantasy. At the time, she had little taste for realism. Several of the key characters in “The Casual Vacancy” are in their mid-teens, and the novel seems most comfortable when it’s with them. This is partly a question of grouping and movement; these are the novel’s tracking shots, when it can follow children on bus rides, on bicycles, and along school corridors; their parents, understandably, are less dynamic. But Rowling also seems profoundly connected to her own teen-age self. (“What does that say about my arrested development, I wonder?” she asked.) One well-observed and recurring motif is the teen-age instinct to adopt, and find comfort in, the families of others—just as Harry Potter adopted the Weasleys. Rowling referred to Jessica, her daughter from her first marriage, who is now a college student but who, until recently, was in a group of friends who moved “from house to house, all of them being charming to everyone else’s parents.” Rowling said that she “hated” being a teen-ager, but then criticized herself for exaggeration, and started again: “I wasn’t particularly happy. I think it’s a dreadful time of life.” She added, “I came from a difficult family. My mother was very ill, and it wasn’t the easiest.” In 1980, when Rowling was fifteen, her mother was given a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. She died a decade later, at forty-five. Rowling has occasionally talked publicly about her grief, and her regret that her mother never knew of her writing career. (Among other philanthropic activities, Rowling founded the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic, at the University of Edinburgh, with a gift of sixteen million dollars.) When Rowling filmed a touching episode of “Who Do You Think You Are?,” the genealogical TV series, the research was all on the maternal line, with particular attention to her French great-grandfather, Louis Volant. The program showed Rowling’s distress at learning that he had not been awarded a Légion d’Honneur, as family lore had it; she had repeated the claim in a 2009 speech, upon receiving her own Légion d’Honneur. And it revealed her pride on discovering that Volant had been awarded a Croix de Guerre, for bravery, in the First World War. “My children have very little sense of my side of the family,” Rowling told me. “I married someone who’s got a vast Scottish family—a clan, really—which is fabulous, and I love it, and I love them, but I wanted to have something I could show my children and say, ‘Look, I also have a family, I also have a background.’ Because there are very few people alive on my mother’s side of the family. I have a sister, that’s clearly very important, but above us nearly everyone’s gone.” That show didn’t mention Rowling’s father, Peter. One of the more interesting characters in “The Casual Vacancy” is Andrew, a restless teen-ager with an abusive, belittling father. “Andrew’s romantic idea that he’ll go and live among the graffiti and broken windows of London—that was me,” Rowling said. “I thought, I have to get away from this place. So all of my energies went into that.” She has previously said that her father frightened her. When I asked her about him, Rowling said, “I did not have an easy relationship with my father, but no one in ‘The Casual Vacancy’ is a portrait of any living person.” I asked if she was writing from experience when Andrew, having done harm to his father, then seeks to make peace with him. “To a degree,” she said. “If you’ve ever been there, if you’ve ever been in a difficult and complex family situation, you will understand. I suppose, to an extent, it’s like Stockholm syndrome, isn’t it? You have to make friends with the warders—this is a matter of survival. And Andrew, having dealt his father this body blow, then turns around and feels it’s time to make an alliance. I think that’s psychologically accurate. Some won’t.” “O.K., maybe that was inelegantly stated.” Her father remarried two years after Anne Rowling’s death. He attended Joanne’s wedding to Neil Murray, in 2001, in Scotland, but they stopped speaking about two years later. “We’ve not had any communication for about nine years,” Rowling told me. She said that the break had already happened when, in December, 2003, Peter Rowling offered his Harry Potter first editions for sale, at Sotheby’s; some of them did not sell, but others did, including a copy of “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,” given to him on Father’s Day, 2000, and signed, “Lots of love from your first born,” with a drawing of a hand reaching for a running gnome. It went for forty-eight thousand dollars. Despite Rowling’s difficult home life, she did well at Wyedean, where only a minority of students went on to college. But she downplayed the achievement of having been head girl, an appointment by school authorities. It meant, she said, “We have caught you once smoking at a bus shelter, and we think you probably won’t go to Borstal”—juvenile detention. (Steve Eddy, the teacher, doesn’t recall the school being so rough.) In 1982, she took the entrance exams for Oxford but was not accepted, and instead studied French at Exeter, a university with a reputation for being “frantically posh,” as Rowling put it. She was suddenly among privately educated girls, in pearls and turned-up shirt collars. Paraphrasing Fitzgerald, she said that she reacted to Exeter “not with the rage of the revolutionary but the smoldering hatred of the peasant.” (There’s some of this spirit in Rowling’s acidic portrait of the haughty youth of Slytherin House, at Hogwarts, Harry Potter’s school.) Martin Sorrell, then a professor of French at the university, recalled a quietly competent student, with a denim jacket and dark hair, who, in academic terms, “gave the appearance of doing what was necessary.” Her own memory is that she did “no work whatsoever.” She wore heavy eyeliner, listened to the Smiths, and read Dickens and Tolkien. In retrospect, she thinks it was fortunate that she didn’t get into Oxford: “I was intimidated enough by Exeter. Imagine—I would have fallen apart at Oxford, I never would have opened my mouth.” Or might she have become academically inspired? “Well, that would have been nice ,” she replied, and laughed. “This isn’t therapy! I don’t want to be talked into eternal regret.” After graduating, in 1986, she worked for a while at Amnesty International, in London, on the research desk for Francophone Africa. In 1990, she had her Harry Potter inspiration, and began developing a detailed plan for a seven-book series. She also worked on an adult novel that she never finished. That year, her mother died. In 1991, she took a job as an English teacher in Portugal. “It was total fight or flight,” she said. “ I’d had a terrible time. Several things happened at once. My mother died, which was obviously the huge one. A long relationship I’d been in ended—and a couple of other things,” including being made redundant from an office job in Manchester. In Porto, she met and married Jorge Arantes, a journalist. She taught at night, and during the day she wrote and listened to Tchaikovsky’s Violin Concerto. Jessica was born in the summer of 1993, and the relationship with Arantes ended soon afterward. He was once quoted in the Daily Express describing their last night; he said that he had dragged her out of their home at five in the morning and slapped her hard. Rowling warned me not to think of the Portugal period, and her first marriage, as a cautious person’s regretted experiment in impetuousness—an E. M. Forster swoon in southern Europe. “I’ll agree with you that going somewhere hot when you’re British always seems like a good idea,” she said. But “that certainly wasn’t the first impetuous thing I’ve done. . . . I had leanings that way for a long time. It wasn’t that Hermione suddenly broke out.” At the end of 1993, she returned to Britain with Jessica, and spent Christmas in Edinburgh with her sister, who was working there as a nurse. Rowling, who no longer owned a winter coat, had three chapters of “Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone” in her suitcase.

We sat in the hotel lounge, in low red chairs. In a neighborhood full of coffee shops, she had brought me to an empty room. She recalled her arrival in Edinburgh. “I was very depressed,” she said. “I felt life was a train wreck. I’d carried this baby out of it, and I was in this place that was very alien and cold, and quite grim.” She decided to stay, with the intention of becoming a schoolteacher; she would need to complete a one-year training course but chose to delay enrollment until she’d finished her book. She signed up for welfare benefits, and found an unappealing apartment, where she lived for a few months. “I was trying to write through that time, and I did,” she said. “But it was patchy and fitful and sometimes I just didn’t have the focus to do it.” (Rowling did write a long, illustrated astrological birth chart for the newborn son of a friend.) She said, “It was Jessica—I have to credit her with so much—that gave me the impetus to go and say to a doctor, ‘I think I’m not quite right, and I need some help here.’ Having done that made a massive difference.” She began therapy, and “pressed on with the book, and things came together. In my head, at least. Externally, my life might not have looked a great deal better. My friend, I hope he wouldn’t mind me saying, my friend Sean, my oldest friend, he lent me a deposit on a much better rented flat.” (Sean Harris was the Wyedean friend with access to the Ford Anglia.) “And, you know, things slowly turned round.” She finished “Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone” in 1995, shortly before starting her teacher-training course. “Having that child forced me to finish the bloody book,” she said. “Not because I thought it was going to save us but because I thought it was going to be my last chance to finish it.” In “The Casual Vacancy,” Krystal Weedon is a teen-ager from the Fields, the housing project near Pagford, and she is the effective head of a household that includes a younger brother and their mother, a heroin addict. Rowling’s descriptions of the family are almost ostentatiously unremitting: drugs, prostitution, the stink of diapers. A visitor notices, in the front yard, “a used condom glistening in the grass beside her feet, like the gossamer cocoon of some huge grub.” There’s little sense that anyone ever made a life in the Fields, or cracked a joke, or hoped for anything but the salvation of Pagford and the middle class; Rowling’s empathy can feel like condescension. But there’s no doubt that she has an understanding of the extremes of British poverty, from sources that include her husband’s experience as a general practitioner in an Edinburgh drug-addiction clinic. (He now practices elsewhere.) Rowling has mocked journalists who, in her view, overdramatize her period of hardship—“I laughed myself stupid,” she has said, after a reporter suggested she couldn’t afford to buy writing paper—but she has contributed to this confusion. In 2008, while in a New York courtroom to oppose the publication of an unauthorized Harry Potter encyclopedia, she testified that there had been times when she was “literally choosing between food and a typewriter ribbon.” She has described her first year or so in Edinburgh as a time of “abject poverty,” or “grinding poverty.” Such language seems to blur the distinction between her life and Krystal Weedon’s. When she spoke at Harvard, she declared that she had been as broke “as it is possible to be in modern Britain without being homeless.” This self-portrait—and talk about life on welfare as “the most soul-destroying thing”—may reflect honorable British embarrassment about the scale of her earnings over the past fifteen years. It balances a private ledger of good fortune and bad fortune. Her account of economic despair, and recovery, may also have a noble political purpose: Rowling has publicly defended Britain’s welfare system against threatened cuts. And it’s true to say that she was a broke single mother, in poor accommodations, at a time of high unemployment. One could understand if she did not want this period to be mistaken for slacker slumming—and her depression may have obscured any advantages she had over other jobless Britons. But those advantages are clear in retrospect: she was a middle-class graduate, poised to start a teaching career, who claimed modest state benefits while she finished a novel, which she partly wrote in an upscale café owned by her sister’s husband. (Such state benefits—for housing and living costs—were then more easily accessible to young British graduates at the start of a professional career than they have ever been in the United States.) This is hard to classify as abject poverty. She has said, “I had to decide whether my baby would rather be handed over to somebody else for most of her waking hours, or be cared for by her mother in far from luxurious surroundings. I chose the latter option.” As she told me, of her time after Portugal, “There wasn’t really any drift. I came back with a plan, I definitely came back with a plan.”

“Dear Mr. Little,” Rowling wrote, in a 1995 letter. “I enclose a synopsis and sample chapters for a book intended for children aged 9–12. I would be very grateful if you could tell me if you would be interested in seeing the full manuscript. Yours sincerely, Joanne Rowling.” Christopher Little, a fairly obscure London literary agent, took her on. A year later, he made a modest deal with Bloomsbury, a British publisher that was only a decade old. “Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone” appeared in 1997, with an initial print run of five hundred. It won Children’s Book of the Year at the British Book Awards, and a gold award in the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize, which is voted for by children. The book also sold to Scholastic, in New York, for more than a hundred thousand dollars. Rowling bought an apartment. She published the second novel, “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,” in 1998. Maria Tatar, a Harvard scholar of children’s literature, recently told me, “It took me years to like Harry Potter.” She now includes the final Potter novel in an undergraduate course entitled “Fairy Tales and Fantasy Literature.” When she first read the books, she recalled, she “could not remember anything.” Then she listened to the audiobooks. “All of a sudden, I got it—I could remember it, and I could visualize it. So much of it is dialogue. It’s not exploring minds. It’s conversations and actions that drive these books.” You’re in the skin of a wizard—“You’re moving along with Harry”—even if you have little access to his mind. She added, “It’s a strange combination of both superficial and deep. That’s what people forget about children’s literature. It is very surface-oriented, but the great writers, and I include Rowling in them, manage to get the depth in, too”—life and death, good and evil. “It’s not a psychological depth but a mythological depth.” Tatar’s students grew up with the books. “You can’t imagine what happens when I just say ‘Harry Potter,’ ” she said. “They’re transported. And they start to speak Harry Potter among themselves, and I feel like an alien.” Many of her students report that, as children, they learned about learning from the books’ depiction of Hogwarts. “It reshaped their understanding of what education was about—and what adults were about. They could recruit these adults and have them help landscape their lives.” Rowling told me, “Very recently, I met a girl in a shop. She was in her early twenties, and she came up to me and said, ‘May I hug you?’ And I said yes, and we hugged. And she said, ‘You were my childhood.’ That’s an amazing thing to hear.” Some people find this disheartening. In Edinburgh, I met Alan Taylor, a journalist and the editor of the Scottish Review of Books , who despaired of Rowling’s “tin ear” and said of her readers, “They were giving their childhood to this woman! They were starting at seven, and by the time they were sixteen they were still reading bloody Harry Potter—sixteen-year-olds, wearing wizard outfits, who should have been shagging behind the bike shed and smoking marijuana and reading Camus.” The Harry Potter books are not rebellious. They validate the concerns of ordinary children: fascination with weird teachers, distress about bullies, desire for status objects. (Broomsticks stand in for the latest electronics.) And Harry, for all the Dickensian under-the-stairs trauma of his early years, starts the series as a winner; he’s wealthy, athletically adept, and famous. Rowling’s respect for a youthful world view never wavers, and her characters do not learn their way out of it. Her achievement is to transfer the everyday dramas of schoolchildren into an abundantly imagined parallel universe. Rowling describes at least four ways, including broomsticks, to move magically from place to place. She uses dozens of beasts from the mythological canon and establishes new myths with matter-of-fact ease. (The idea of a Parselmouth—a person who can speak to snakes—seems ancient and fully formed.) She uses plot devices that could each fuel countless romantic comedies: a truth serum, transfiguration, time travel, invisibility, immortality, alchemy. Readers of the series lived with Harry, but also with Rowling, as the almost-visible engineer of a great fantasy machine that, in the course of seven volumes, runs with remarkable smoothness. Even young enthusiasts seemed to become textual critics of a sort—alert to the idea of an author, at a desk, making decisions about who should live and who should die. “I do think that’s a lot of what children responded to—that sense that someone was in control,” Rowling said. “That they were walking into a place where they knew the rules, or there were rules to be discovered.” There’s little irony, and the reader rarely knows more or less than Harry. In the seven novels, Christmas Day always falls midway. Stephen King and others have teased Rowling for overusing adverbs when describing speech. The habit seems to show a determination not to be misunderstood. So too, in a way, do her repetitions. (Over a few hundred pages, as Harry enters adolescence, Diggory reddens, Harry reddens, Ron reddens, and Fudge reddens; Percy goes slightly pink, then very pink; Hermione is slightly pink; Malfoy is slightly pink and then brilliantly pink; Hermione is very pink and then rather pink; Colin also goes pink; Hermione is, again, slightly pink; so is Ron, and then Hermione; and then she’s flushed pink with pleasure. Lavender blushes, followed by Hagrid and Hermione.) And if Rowling’s metaphors were sometimes grudging—“like some bizarre fast-growing flower”; “like some weird crab”—it may be because metaphors carry you away, for a moment, from the place where the story has put you. Rowling’s goal was to keep you there. Rowling’s mindfulness about plot led her to have almost the same relationship with her material as an obsessive fan did. Ian Rankin recalled bumping into her one day in an Edinburgh café: “It was incredible to see her, writing longhand, doing this family tree for a character. I can’t think of any other author I know who would go into that kind of detail for something that’s not going to be there on the page.” It was like a video game where you never got to the edge of the rendered landscape. Despite the thoroughness of the final reckoning in “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” and its extended epilogue, there’s much that Rowling knows but has not written. In 2007, after the final book was published, she announced that Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts, was gay. I asked her if Dudley, Harry’s cousin, had any children as an adult, and she told me that he had two.

“We coined the phrase ‘denial marketing,’ ” Minna Fry, a former marketing director of Bloomsbury, recently said of the series. “The more people want, the less you give.” Ahead of each publication, she said, “we were extremely tantalizing—releasing little nuggets.” She laughed. “If you were really lucky, you’d get the title! ” As Fry remembers it, the phenomenon changed complexion with the appearance of the fourth novel, “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,” in the summer of 2000. It was the first time that the publication of a Rowling book was synchronized across the Atlantic. Between them, Bloomsbury and Scholastic printed a first edition of more than four million copies. Bloomsbury decked out a steam train as the Hogwarts Express, and it took Rowling around the U.K. Bloomsbury was still a small company; Fry inflated the balloons herself. “We didn’t have events managers,” she said. On the first day, she and her colleagues were astonished by the size of the crowds at King’s Cross. “We couldn’t even get into the station. Can you imagine what it would be like now, with Twitter?” Fry found a reporter from an American newsmagazine hiding in the coal bin behind the steam engine, her face smudged black. When the train made stops, children awaiting an audience with Rowling entered her rail car at one end, and left at the other end with a signed book. As Fry recalled, “There were parents beating up other parents to get in the queue.” At one besieged stop, Fry was Rowling’s decoy, waving to the crowd through a window at the front of the train while Rowling escaped from the rear. Fry said that Rowling was unsettled by the disorder of the tour: “She loved bits of it. But I don’t think any of us realized quite how freaked out she was.” Fry learned this only later. “She was quite thin-skinned about something that we thought was quite funny. I think she thought we’d put her in jeopardy.” Fry had enjoyed a friendly relationship with Rowling, but after that book’s launch Rowling “started to have these layers of people to protect her.” She hired her own public-relations team, and became a little sequestered behind “people who I think made her feel safe.” Unlike before, “we weren’ t able to ring her up and gossip. But she was still kind, funny—very funny—and slightly bewildered by the whole thing. And still deserving of all the good things.” Fry recalled coming across Rowling and her children, not long ago, in a playground in a London park. Fry introduced her young son (who said, “You’re not J. K. Rowling!”), and she was struck by the force of Rowling’s attention upon him. “She was fascinated by everything he was doing, what he was wearing. He had a new toy. She wanted to know how it worked, everything about it.” When I asked Rowling about the period after “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,” she said, “That was a really hard time for me. The pressure of it had become overwhelming, actually. I found it difficult to write, which had never happened to me before in my life. The intensity of the scrutiny was overwhelming. I had been utterly unprepared for that. And I needed to step back. Badly needed to step back.” She had published four books in four years. “I said to Bloomsbury, ‘There won’t be a book next year, I can’t do it,’ which they were great about. It ended up being three years. So it was 2000 for ‘Goblet of Fire,’ and 2003 for ‘Phoenix.’ ” In that time, Warner Bros. began releasing films based on the novels—with a predominantly British cast, thanks in part to Rowling’s pressure. The movies have since made $7.7 billion. She also met Neil Murray, a friend of her sister’s. Rowling resisted being set up: “He was just out of a marriage himself—I just thought that would be complicated. I wasn’t up for that.” But they eventually found themselves seated next to each other at a charity event in Edinburgh. He was aware of the Harry Potter books but hadn’t read them. The couple have a son and a daughter together. A few years ago, a documentary crew travelling with Rowling recorded what seems to be Murray’s only public comment about his wife: “Jo detaches herself,” he said, in her hearing, with a smile. “When she’s very stressed, she’ll detach herself and only trust one person, and that’s herself. So everyone else gets blocked out and she becomes more and more stressed and less and less able to accept any help.”

Late last year, Rowling appeared at the Leveson Inquiry into British press conduct, set up by the government in response to revelations about reporters hacking into celebrity voice-mail inboxes. Over months, scores of actors, politicians, and journalists offered evidence to the inquiry; Rowling appeared on the same day as Sienna Miller, the actress, and Max Mosely, a former car-racing administrator. Mosley described being secretly photographed with five women in a scenario that the News of the World described, falsely, as an enactment of a Nazi-related sexual fantasy with prostitutes. Miller said that, for years, she had to contend with ten or fifteen paparazzi outside her home; she had been chased by them, and even spat upon to provoke a reaction. Her phone was hacked. But Miller was careful to emphasize that others, including the family of Milly Dowler, a murdered teen-ager whose phone was hacked after her disappearance, had experienced worse. “Dear old Havemeyer-he died in the saddle.” Rowling’s evidence was less startling, but it was delivered in a more harrowed, aggrieved tone. It may be that, because Rowling is quite unassuming, she has not thought to learn the art of appearing unassuming in public. (Indeed, her public posture is often that of someone wronged: she has described buying herself a big aquamarine ring as a “no one is grinding me down” gesture made in response to tabloid coverage, and has characterized moving from an apartment to a very large house as being “driven out” by the press.) She told the inquiry that, when Jessica was five, she once came home from school with a note from a reporter in her schoolbag, apparently placed there by the parent of a classmate. One can’t argue with Rowling’s unhappiness about the episode, but it seems a poor example of Fleet Street’s darkest arts. A few years later, Rowling was photographed on a public beach in Mauritius. One published image showed Jessica, breaking a British press rule about paparazzi shots of children. (It was not republished.) More recently, Rowling and Murray were photographed on an Edinburgh street, and the published shot showed the face of their son, David, at nineteen months. Rowling had other stories to tell, and spoke of the burden of having to take preventive measures to avoid further intrusion. But when she wrote, in her witness statement, that “it pains me that my family and I do not appear to have the choice of living our lives in the same way that other members of the general public do,” the wealthiest novelist in history was perhaps asking for too much. She and her family have spent a private evening at the White House, and she told me that the Obama daughters like her books. Across the world, fans call her “My Queen.” And if Rowling, by the standards of her fortune, lives quite modestly—Ian Rankin has told her that, in her position, he would buy a helicopter and gold-plated pinball machines—public documents show that, to expand the grounds of her Edinburgh house, she recently bought and demolished a modern, $1.6-million house that stood next door. Her discomfort with fame can give her the air of being more caught up with the idea of her celebrity than those she’s addressing. Encouraged by Lord Justice Leveson to make recommendations for reform, she said, “I can’t pretend I have a magical answer,” and added, “No Harry Potter joke intended.” If Rowling has become exasperated by the media, the feeling has been reciprocated. When the London Times interviewed her in 2003, it was asked to sign a contract that, according to an account later written by Brian MacArthur, then the paper’s executive editor, “stipulated precisely when the interview would occur and who would be the interviewer and photographer; how and where it would be advertised and promoted in the paper and on radio; and gave Rowling full approval of captions, headlines, straplines, line drawings, graphics, headings, advance trails, quotes and photographs.” Just before publication, there was a gruelling, six-hour argument in the Times offices about what, exactly, was meant by “quote approval.” Rowling was represented by Neil Blair, a British lawyer and a former Warner Bros. executive who had worked on the Harry Potter films, and who joined Christopher Little’s agency in 2001. Blair said that in the interview Rowling had misspoken about her contract with Bloomsbury, and, in insisting that the quote be revised, took a stance that MacArthur found extraordinarily aggressive. MacArthur wrote in his paper that this “left us feeling soiled,” adding, “our self-respect was eroded, our journalistic integrity insulted.” Minna Fry, who was also at the meeting, says that she was, at times, “astonished by what Neil was doing,” and had her head in her hands. “I realized how much was now at stake.” Blair, remembering that day, said he would “swear on the Bible that I was not aggressive at all.” (For this article, Rowling sought quote approval, which was not given.) Last summer, Neil Blair left Christopher Little and set up his own agency. Rowling joined him as the star client of the Blair Partnership. Little’s statement, at the time, was that he was “disappointed and surprised.” As Rowling described it to me, “Neil and Christopher reached a point where it wasn’t working, the two of them together, and I had to make a decision. It was very, very difficult.”"
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/07/11/the-candy-man,newyorker,Roald Dahl’s Subversive Storytelling,[],"Roald Dahl, the British author of children’s books, wrote in a tiny cottage at the end of a trellised pathway canopied with twisting linden trees. He called it the “writing hut,” and, since Dahl was nearly six feet six, he must have inhabited it like a giant in an elf’s house. Dahl died in 1990, at the age of seventy-four, but one day a year his widow, Felicity, invites children to the estate where he lived, in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, and local families swarm in like guests at Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory. There are games—Splat the Rat and Guess the Number of Sweeties in the Jar—and tea, cakes, and orange squash for sale. An R.A.F. band plays in the shade of the house. This year, I attended myself. The appointed day was hot and bright, with a clear sky that Dahl would have described as “milky blue.” The girls wore sherbet-colored canvas hats; the boys, their pale legs poking out of shorts, looked destined for sunburns. Many of the kids peered inside the writing hut—they weren’t allowed in—and seemed to discover there further evidence that Dahl was a strangely sympathetic adult who shared a preoccupation with candy, a clinical fascination with the body, and a love of ingenious, self-devised schemes. The adults who looked into the hut were less impressed. The walls, lined with Styrofoam, were stained sepia from all the cigarettes Dahl smoked; there was a grotty wing chair; and wires for a jury-rigged heating system dangled from the ceiling. “You’d expect it to be grander,” one woman said. But the kids saw more possibilities in a musty old hut of one’s own. They liked the fact that Dahl, unsatisfied with desks, had designed a baize-covered writing board, to balance on his lap just so. And they loved that he kept, on a side table, a jar containing gristly bits of his own spine, which had been removed during an operation on his lower back. Next to the jar was a waxy-looking knob that turned out to be Dahl’s hip bone, along with a titanium replacement. “It makes a good letter opener,” one little boy said of the prosthetic hip. “Has it got blood on it?” another asked hopefully. Several young visitors asked for permission to hold the ball of chocolate-bar wrappers that Dahl had made as a young man; he scrunched a new one into the ball each day, after eating his habitual lunchtime treat. (Now hard and surprisingly heavy, the wad resembles a small cannonball.) Still, what seemed to excite the children the most was the paperback collection of Dahl’s own work. “Look!” several of them cried. “There are the books! ”

Dahl, whose first book for children, “The Gremlins,” was published in 1943, and whose last, “The Minpins,” was published posthumously, in 1991, has been astonishingly popular for nearly half a century. In a 2000 survey, British readers named him their favorite author. Around the world, more than ten million copies of his books sold last year. This number is all the more striking because Dahl did not write an extended series, which is often the key to mega-success as a children’s writer. Nor, in an era when many children’s books are specifically marketed to either boys or girls, does his work appeal primarily to one gender. Six of his books have been made into movies, and a monster-budget version of “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” (1964), directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp as the daft, dangerous, and endlessly inventive confectioner, Willy Wonka, opens in July. Dahl is also, however, a children’s writer whom many adults over the years have disliked or distrusted, though they have not always found it easy to say why. It’s not because his work is sexually explicit (a common complaint about, say, Judy Blume’s). There is no hint of sex, or even romance, in Dahl’s children’s books, most of which are intended for preadolescent children. Nor are they disappointing as pieces of writing—quite the opposite. Dahl’s books, which move along at a seductively brisk pace, are propelled by crisp verbs (“clambered,” “chirruped,” “rasped”) and delightful made-up words (“swishfiggler,” “snozzcumber,” “Vermicious Knids”). He plays exuberantly with synonyms (“He’s dotty!” they cried. “He’s barmy!” “He’s batty!” “He’s nutty!” “He’s screwy!” “He’s wacky!”). The tone is conversational, confiding, and funny, with a liberal sprinkling of exclamation points and phrases written entirely in capital letters. It’s as if the sentences came embedded with their own stage directions. (Like “Winnie the Pooh” and “Alice in Wonderland,” Dahl’s books originated as stories told aloud to children; he had five of his own.) In a Dahl book, you are never out of earshot of a sly authorial voice that is sharing a secret joke about a character—or is announcing that it’s about to yank you out of a scene that’s becoming a bit too gross or distressing. Adults’ objections to Dahl have more to do with his sensibility. There is bathroom humor: the protagonist of “The B.F.G.” (1982), the Big Friendly Giant, insists on “whizpopping,” his word for farting, in front of the Queen. And Dahl has a waspish tone—unsentimental, ever so slightly sadistic, and archly amusing—that’s closer to Evelyn Waugh’s than to Beverly Cleary’s. (Lemony Snicket, the author of “A Series of Unfortunate Events,” owes a significant debt to Dahl.) “Matilda” (1988) is the story of a prodigiously bright little girl who suffers at the hands of her boorish mother and father. The book offers a bracingly disdainful commentary on neglectful, selfish parents. But, first, Dahl has a little fun at the expense of the doting ones: It’s a funny thing about mothers and fathers. Even when their own child is the most disgusting little blister you could ever imagine, they still think he or she is wonderful. Some parents go further. They become so blinded by adoration they manage to convince themselves their child has qualities of genius. Well, there’s nothing very wrong with all this. It’s the way of the world. It’s only when the parents begin telling us about the brilliance of their own revolting offspring, that we start shouting, “Bring us a basin! We’re going to be sick!” School teachers suffer a good deal from having to listen to this sort of twaddle from proud parents, but they usually get their own back when the time comes to write their end-of-term reports. If I were a teacher, I would cook up some real scorchers for the children of doting parents. “Your son Maximilian,” I would write, “is a total wash-out. I hope you have a family business you can push him into when he leaves school because he sure as heck won’t get a job anywhere else.” Or, if I were feeling lyrical that day, I might write, “It is a curious truth that grasshoppers have their hearing organs in the sides of their abdomen. Your daughter Vanessa, judging by what she’s learnt this term, has no hearing organs at all.” Routinely in Dahl’s books, adults who mistreat children or animals get grotesque comeuppances, and these are often engineered by the victims, through their own cunning and courage. In “The Twits” (1980), the repellent Mr. and Mrs. Twit are glued upside down to the floor by the enterprising monkeys and birds they’ve been tormenting. In “James and the Giant Peach” (1961), the evil Aunt Spiker and Aunt Sponge are crushed to death when James and the eponymous peach roll down a hill. And it’s not just bad parents who get their comeuppance. In “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” Dahl metes out nasty punishments to unpleasant children. The greedy Augustus Gloop is squeezed into the chocolate works; the gum-chewing Violet Beauregarde blows up into a giant blueberry; the television addict Mike Teavee is miniaturized; the spoiled Veruca Salt is dropped down a garbage chute. That the kids all make it out of the factory in the end doesn’t much soften the fact that Wonka saw them go with no regret—indeed, with considerable glee. In many children’s books—contrary to what parents tell their children about the meaning of appearances—physical ugliness signifies its moral equivalent. Dahl takes this to an extreme, describing his villains’ repulsive attributes with brio: Mr. Hazell’s “great, glistening, beery face . . . as pink as a ham,” in “Danny, the Champion of the World” (1975); Aunt Sponge’s resemblance to “a great white soggy overboiled cabbage”; the “grizzly old grunion of a grandma” in “George’s Marvelous Medicine” (1981)—the one Dahl book I find irredeemably sour—who has “a small puckered-up mouth, like a dog’s bottom.” Dahl shared with George Orwell an acute sense of why small children often see adults as unsightly or intimidating. “Part of the reason for the ugliness of adults, in a child’s eyes, is that the child is usually looking upward, and few faces are at their best when seen from below,” Orwell wrote. Dahl once said that adults should get down on their knees for a week, in order to remember what it’s like to live in a world in which the people with all the power literally loom over you. In Dahl’s fiction, the bad characters aren’t just bad; they’re swing-kids-around-by-their-braids awful—a quality that some adult readers find unsubtle but many children find hilarious and satisfying. Even the good adult characters are often rash or easily cowed, whereas the kids in Dahl’s books are usually sensible, mature, and unflappable. (The kids make all the “good decisions,” as my nine-year-old son puts it.) And in Dahl’s stories the kinds of elaborate schemes that children are forever concocting—and that sensible adults are forever rejecting as impractical or dangerous—yield triumphant results. When the Giant Peach is attacked by sharks while floating across the ocean, James comes up with the idea of attaching loops of string to a flock of seagulls, in order to lift the peach into the air—and, voilà, that’s precisely what happens! Dahl’s books regularly show up on the American Library Association’s list of titles that patrons ask to be restricted from young children or removed from the shelves. In 1995, a mother attempting to expunge Dahl from elementary-school libraries in Virginia told the Washington Post that in his books “children misbehave and take retribution on adults, and there’s never, ever a consequence for their actions.” According to this surprisingly common critique of Dahl, to defy one adult—no matter how bad a person—is to defy us all. In 1972, the Horn Book , a journal of children’s literature, published a screed against Dahl by Eleanor Cameron, a children’s-book author. “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” she charged, was “one of the most tasteless books ever written for children.” The book was not just about candy; it was candy, “in that it is delectable and soothing while we are undergoing the brief sensory pleasure it affords but leaves us poorly nourished with our taste dulled for better fare.” Dahl reviled television, but his book provided the same easy satisfactions: it was a fast-paced, plot-driven celebration of empty calories. The science-fiction author Ursula K. LeGuin wrote in to second Cameron’s criticism, though she had to admit that “children between eight and eleven seem to be truly fascinated” by Dahl’s books. Indeed, one of her own children, she regretted to say, “used to finish ‘Charlie’ and then start right over from the beginning (she was subject to these fits for about two months at age eleven). She was like one possessed while reading it, and for a while after reading she was, for a usually amiable child, quite nasty.” The books, LeGuin concluded, “provide a genuine escape experience, a tiny psychological fugue, very like that provided by comic books.” In the nineteen-eighties, feminists lambasted Dahl for his supposed misogyny, focussing on “The Witches” (1983). In 1985, one critic called the book “a dangerous publication,” which bore a “striking similarity” to the “misogynistic” fifteenth-century witch-hunting text “Malleus Maleficarum.” It was a bizarre comparison. Dahl does write in “The Witches” that a “witch is always a woman”—but not that a woman is always a witch. The strongest, most appealing character in the book is the boy narrator’s cigar-smoking, tough-minded, and immensely loving grandmother. Anti-Dahlism has been further fuelled by a 1994 unauthorized biography, by the British writer Jeremy Treglown, which presents a complicated, domineering, and sometimes disagreeable man. Dahl was “a war hero, a connoisseur, a philanthropist and a devoted family man who had to confront an appalling succession of tragedies,” Treglown writes. “He was also . . . a fantasist, an anti-Semite, a bully and a self-publicizing trouble-maker.” When his first wife, the actress Patricia Neal, suffered a severe stroke at the age of thirty-nine, he adopted a cruel-to-be-kind strategy—bullying, goading, and sometimes humiliating her into acting again. He was prone to eruptions of pique. In 1981, Robert Gottlieb, who was at the time the editorial director of Knopf, Dahl’s American publisher, severed ties with Dahl, citing his “abusiveness” to the staff. More than once, Dahl offered up anti-Semitic remarks; in 1983, he told a journalist that “there’s a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity . . . I mean there is always a reason why anti-anything crops up anywhere; even a stinker like Hitler didn’t just pick on them for no reason.” (Such noxious sentiments, it must be said, cannot be found in his work for children.) And, in 1989, Dahl, who had no trouble waxing indignant about attempts to ban his own work, denounced Salman Rushdie as “a dangerous opportunist” after the fatwa was issued against him. Dahl’s personal reputation is justifiably tainted, but his work has been unfairly assailed. When it comes to literature for adults, we’ve mostly stopped judging a work by its author’s personal morality. Why should we hold children’s writers to a stricter standard?

Dahl’s own childhood had a lovely, rather magical side, as well as a bitter, Draconian one. He was born in 1916, in Llandaff, Wales, to Norwegian immigrants. His father, Harald, was a successful ship’s broker. His formidable and capable mother, Sofie, looked upon him as her favorite; Roald, one of five children, was known as “the apple.” When Roald was three, the eldest girl, Astri, who was seven, died of appendicitis. Harald Dahl was so “overwhelmed with grief,” Dahl writes in his 1984 memoir, “Boy,” that he had no strength to fight a bout of pneumonia; he died two months later. Each summer, Sofie took the children to a remote island in Norway, where Roald heard marvellous stories about witches and trolls, swam in the ice-blue fjords, and ate ice cream with “thousands of little chips of crisp burnt toffee mixed into it.” Yet the British boarding schools that he attended, starting at the age of nine, were mostly a misery. Much of “Boy” consists of Dahl’s recollections of beatings by his headmasters. Caning was the favored mode of punishment. “I was frightened of that cane,” Dahl writes. “There is no small boy in the world who wouldn’t be. It wasn’t simply an instrument for beating you. It was a weapon for wounding. It lacerated the skin. It caused severe black and scarlet bruising that took three weeks to disappear, and all the time during those three weeks, you could feel your heart beating along the wounds.” When Dahl was at school, his talents seem to have gone unappreciated. A report card from Repton in 1930—which is on display at the new Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre, in Great Missenden—offers the following assessment of his performance in English: “A persistent muddler, writing and saying the opposite of what he means. Fails to correct this by real revision or thought. Has possibilities.” This seems particularly unfair, given that the young Dahl, judging by a sample of his juvenilia at the museum—“The Life Story of a Penny”—already showed flair as a storyteller. But perhaps his teachers didn’t much approve of his nascent sympathy for the underdog—in this case, a lump of copper that must endure having “a picture of King George V’s head stamped cruelly on one side of me.” One compensation for Dahl was that he excelled at games and sports. Being tall probably protected him from a certain amount of torment, too—as a teen-ager, he was well on his way to acquiring his adult nicknames, Lofty and Stalky. He and the other boys at Repton also enjoyed a curious perk, courtesy of the Cadbury chocolate company. “Every now and again, a plain grey cardboard box was dished out to each boy in our House,” Dahl writes in “Boy.” Inside were eleven chocolate bars—aspirants to the Cadbury line. Dahl and the other boys got to rate the candy, and they took their task very seriously. (“Too subtle for the common palate” was one of Dahl’s assessments.) He later recalled this as the first time that he thought of chocolate bars as something concocted—the product of a laboratory setting—and the thought stayed with him until he invented his own crazy factory. Dahl is brilliant at evoking the childhood obsession with candy, which most adults can recall only vaguely. In his books, candy is often a springboard for long riffs on imagined powers and possibilities. Far from being the crude ode to instant gratification that critics like Cameron detect, Dahl’s evocation of candy is an impetus to wonder. When Billy, the boy in “The Giraffe, the Pelly, and Me” (1985), opens his own candy shop—talk about wish fulfillment!—he orders confections from all over the world. “I can remember especially the Giant Wangdoodles from Australia, every one with a huge ripe red strawberry hidden inside its crispy chocolate crust,” he says. “And The Electric Fizzcocklers that made every hair on your head stand straight up on end. . . . There was a whole lot of splendid stuff from the great Wonka factory itself, for example the famous Willy Wonka Rainbow Drops—suck them and you can spit in seven different colours. And his stickjaw for talkative parents.” The word “confection” has a double meaning in Dahl’s world—candy is a source not only of sweetness but of creativity. On a field trip recently, I sat next to three nine-year-old boys who spent forty-five minutes in a Wonka-inspired reverie, inventing their own candies. When Dahl left Repton, in 1934, he did not go to college but instead took a job with Shell, which eventually sent him to East Africa to sell oil. When the Second World War broke out, Dahl joined the R.A.F. as a fighter pilot. “Going Solo,” the sequel to “Boy,” offers lively accounts of Dahl’s encounters with African wildlife—especially the dread black mamba snake—and eccentric British expatriates, “this pack of sinewy sunburnt gophers and their bright bony little wives.” And it contains thrilling stories of Dahl’s experiences flying missions over the Mediterranean. In 1940, he crashed in the Sahara, and suffered injuries that caved in his nose. The plastic surgeon who rebuilt the nose tried, unsuccessfully, to make it look like Rudolph Valentino’s. When Dahl began to suffer blackouts as a result of his crash injuries, he stopped flying, and in 1942 went to Washington, D.C., as a military attaché. He met Martha Gellhorn and Ernest Hemingway and played poker with Senator Harry Truman. He began to write up some of his wartime experiences. He also met Walt Disney, to whom he sold “The Gremlins,” his first children’s story. It was based on an R.A.F. legend of gnomelike creatures with the capacity to sabotage a flight. (No movie version was ever produced.) Most of Dahl’s early writing was for adults. He specialized in wartime stories and macabre tales with surprise endings, or what the British call “a twist in the tail.” In a typical story, a wife kills her husband with a frozen leg of lamb, then cooks the murder weapon and serves it to police investigators. But by the early sixties some of that success had begun petering out. The New Yorker , which had earlier accepted several stories, now sent rejection notices. Dahl’s adult stories were crisply, shiveringly enjoyable—rather like “Twilight Zone” episodes—but they showed little compassion or psychological penetration. It was children, it seemed, not adults, on whom Dahl could lavish empathy. In 1953, he married Patricia Neal, who had recently ended a long affair with Gary Cooper, and the following year bought a house in Buckinghamshire, near his mother and sisters. Dahl adored his children, but in his family life he suffered several tragedies. His baby son, Theo, was badly injured when a car hit the carriage his nanny was pushing across a street in Manhattan. He survived but suffered from hydrocephalus. A daughter, Olivia, died from measles at the age of seven. Treglown writes that, shortly after Olivia’s death, Dahl and Neal visited his old headmaster, the retired Archbishop of Canterbury. Dahl wanted to think that Olivia could have the companionship of dogs in the afterlife, because she had loved them so in life. He was furious when the Archbishop told him that the Christian vision of Heaven did not include canines. In 1965, Neal suffered a stroke while she was pregnant with the couple’s fifth daughter, Lucy. While she recovered, Dahl took over running the household; he even drove the kids to school in the morning. If he was sometimes moody or gruff or turned on people who disappointed him, who can blame him? He was pragmatic and resourceful. Prompted by Theo’s difficulties, he helped devise a valve for draining water on the brain which was used to treat thousands of children. And if he was not physically affectionate with his children—as Tessa Dahl, his eldest daughter, has written—he shared their interest in pranks, knock-knock jokes, and incessant teasing. He also had a gift for creating an aura of magic. Dahl once directed Tessa to look at the grass below her bedroom window. Fairies, he explained, had inscribed her name on the lawn. (He’d done it himself, by sprinkling weed killer.) When the Dahls hosted slumber parties, he’d rouse the children at midnight, take them outside, and tell them stories under a tree. After thirty years of marriage, Dahl divorced Neal, and, in 1983, he married Felicity Crosland, a wood-carver with whom he had been having a long affair. He seems to have found greater happiness and serenity with Felicity, who was fond of gardening and cooking. Tessa Dahl has observed of her father, “When in 1983 he wrote, in ‘The Witches,’ ‘It doesn’t matter who you are or what you look like as long as somebody loves you,’ he was a changing writer. My father had fallen in love. When he married my stepmother in the early eighties, everything altered.” Several of Dahl’s best books—“The B.F.G.,” “The Witches,” “Matilda”—were written during this late period. In these works, his natural acidity is tempered with sweetness. Each book centers on a relationship between a child and an adult which is a dream of perfect understanding and companionability. The boy protagonist of “The Witches” adores his Grandmamma, who tells him the gruesome truth about witches and helps him defeat them. When the boy is transformed into a mouse—one that still has his own voice and feelings—he is comforted to realize that, with a mouse’s shorter life span, he won’t outlive her. He tells her happily, “I’ll be a very old mouse and you’ll be a very old grandmother and soon after that we’ll both die together.” (None of Dahl’s ideal adult companions are mothers—they are fathers, grandparents, or mother surrogates, such as the ladybug in “James and the Giant Peach.”) In “The B.F.G.,” an orphaned and unloved girl, Sophie, forms a strong friendship with the only living giant who refuses to eat human beings: “Words,” he said, “is oh such a twitch-tickling problem to me all my life. So you must simply try to be patient and stop squibbling. As I am telling you before, I know exactly what words I am wanting to say, but somehow or other they is always getting squiffs-quiddled around.” “That happens to everyone,” Sophie said. “Not like it happens to me,” the B.F.G. said. “I is speaking the most terrible wigglish.” “I think you speak beautifully,” Sophie said. “You do?” cried the B.F.G., suddenly brightening. “You really do?” “Simply beautifully,” Sophie repeated. “Well that is the nicest present anyone is ever giving me in my whole life!” cried the B.F.G. “Are you sure you is not twiddling my leg?” “Of course not,” Sophie said. “I just love the way you talk. “How wondercrump!” cried the B.F.G., still beaming. “How whoopsy-splunkers. How absolutely squiffling! I is all of a stutter.” And yet the essence of Dahl is his willingness to let children triumph over adults. He is a modern writer of fairy tales, who intuitively understands the sort of argument that Bruno Bettelheim made in his 1976 book, “The Uses of Enchantment.” Children need the dark materials of fairy tales because they need to make sense—in a symbolic, displaced way—of their own feelings of anger, resentment, and powerlessness. Children also benefit from learning about violence and brutishness in fairy tales, Bettelheim writes, for it counters the “widespread refusal to let children know that the source of much that goes wrong in our life is due to our natures—the propensity of all men for acting aggressively, asocially, selfishly.” Many fairy tales—and most of Dahl’s work—are complex narratives of wish fulfillment. They teach the reader, Bettelheim writes, that “a struggle against severe difficulties in life is unavoidable, is an intrinsic part of human existence—but if one does not shy away, but steadfastly meets unexpected and often unjust hardships, one masters all obstacles and at the end emerges victorious.” Or, in any case, this is a hopeful fantasy which sustains us all."

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/christopher-nolans-wartime-epic,newyorker,Christopher Nolan’s Wartime Epic,[],"Deep space was where Christopher Nolan boldly chose to go for his last feature, “ Interstellar ” (2014). Now he has aimed for shallow waters. Most of “Dunkirk” is set on and off the beaches of northern France, close to the Belgian border—a perilous place to be, in late May and early June of 1940. The British Expeditionary Force, dispatched to France in the fall of the previous year, had been forced into an inglorious retreat. The result was that a multitude of Allied troops were stranded in and around the town of Dunkirk, waiting at the sea’s edge to be rescued. For prowling German aircraft, they were easy prey. Thankfully, salvation did arrive, in the shape not just of the Royal Navy but also of a flotilla of small vessels—the Little Ships, as they came to be known, some seven hundred strong—that had been summoned to the fray. Eventually, in what Churchill called “a miracle of deliverance,” more than three hundred thousand men made it back to England.

This saga is an unlikely candidate for a major Hollywood production, especially one written and directed by the maker of the “Dark Knight” trilogy. It’s hard to think of a more parochial tale. Dunkirk is stitched into the British mythology of the Second World War and, even now, occasional mention is made of “the Dunkirk spirit,” yet the legend has never travelled far, and for obvious reasons. Operation Dynamo—the code name for the evacuation—was not a victory but a barely averted catastrophe, and it came on the heels of what Churchill himself, in the House of Commons, lamented as “a colossal military disaster” in Belgium and France. Many countries, preferring straightforward triumphs, would have swept such an episode under the rug with a mixture of embarrassment and relief. Something about Dunkirk, though, appeals to the peculiar British love of the gallantly narrow squeak, and, in the deployment of the Little Ships, to an abiding fondness for the doughty and the makeshift. You can understand Nolan’s interest; born in London, in 1970, he belongs to what is probably the last generation to have been reared on the rousing fable of Dunkirk. Why on earth, however, should he want to spread the word?

A clue to this puzzle comes early in the film. Up onscreen appear the phrases “1. The Mole,” “2. The Sea,” and “3. The Air.” They introduce us to the three narrative strands that will wind through the next hundred minutes or so; notice the hint of the elemental. The Mole refers to a concrete jetty jutting into Dunkirk Harbor, whereas the air is the domain of a Spitfire pilot (Tom Hardy). When we first encounter him, he is already aloft, in a formation of three. Never do we discover which squadron he belongs to, or what sort of life he has left behind on the ground. For the most part, all that we see of him is his goggled eyes; not until the finale are we shown the rest of him, and only in the ensuing credits do we find out that he is called Farrier. It must have taken Hardy almost an entire morning to learn his lines, which seem even sparser than his dialogue for “Mad Max: Fury Road” (2015), although, as we know from that masterwork, the less we hear from him the tighter our grasp of his character, and the greater the powers that seem to be held in check. At one point in “Dunkirk,” Farrier, low on fuel, is faced with a choice: pursue a German bomber that is harrying a warship crammed with evacuees, or turn tail and head for home before the tank runs dry? He says nothing, but those eyes reveal all. We follow his thoughts as clearly as we do every tip and tilt of his wings.

No such clarity below. Men are lined up on the shore, hoping to get onto one of the ships that dock in the harbor, but a sullen quiet prevails; the next bomb could shred and scatter them, and they cannot predict where it will hit. Shouldering through the crowd are a couple of young British soldiers with a stretcher, who are trying to get one of the wounded on board—and maybe, in the process, sneak a berth themselves. Gradually, one of them, Tommy (Fionn Whitehead), gains a foothold in the drama, though you couldn’t call him the hero, for there is no main character in “Dunkirk.” Instead, various figures move onstage and off: Commander Bolton (Kenneth Branagh), who oversees the embarkation; Alex (Harry Styles), a fellow-evacuee whom Tommy meets halfway through; and a numb and nameless man (Cillian Murphy) found shuddering on a capsized hull. Silent at first, he eventually mutters, “U-boat.”

Meanwhile, out in the English Channel, and heading to Dunkirk, is the Moonstone, skippered by Dawson (Mark Rylance), her owner. (In truth, the majority of Little Ships were requisitioned for the voyage across, but there were exceptions, and that is why Dawson casts off just before the uniformed authorities can reach him.) He recognizes a Spitfire from its growling thrum overhead, without having to glance up. “Rolls-Royce Merlin engine,” he says. “Sweetest sound you could hear out here.” He is no more voluble than the rest of the folk in this film, who seem either stunned by events or taut with determination, but Rylance, as ever, conveys a vigor of spirit through the simple crispness of his gestures. He removes his jacket on departure, and, throughout the ordeal, wears a white shirt, a tie, and a sweater, as if he were doing a bit of Sunday gardening rather than hauling a shoal of his countrymen, half-drowned and drenched in oil, from the unfriendly waves."
http://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/the-strange-wonders-of-cactuses-the-plant-of-our-times,newyorker,"The Strange Wonders of Cactuses, the Plant of Our Times",[],"Cactuses are spiky and rough; foreboding and strange; gnarled, Seussian, and sometimes toxic. They remind us of nature’s irreverent brutality, and of its occasional inexplicability. They evoke places where people can’t survive. But when removed from those places—their native habitats—individually potted, and sold as decoration for a house, a garden, or an office, they are among the easiest plants a person can have, requiring little or no care and still looking good. More unusual species can be novelties, or prizes for collectors, or even significant investments. But many people never consider where their potted cactus or succulent originated, and what purpose its bizarre characteristics served. The magnificent landscapes and ecosystems in which the plant evolved are forgotten.

This bothered three cactus-crazed young men in Los Angeles—Jeff Kaplon, Max Martin, and Carlos Morera—who in 2014 opened the Cactus Store , a boutique featuring a large collection of unusual, interesting, and, in some cases, rare species of cactuses and succulents. (Cactuses are a family within the taxonomy of succulents.) Since California was well into a severe drought, many residents were switching to drought-resilient landscapes, and the timing of the opening, although coincidental, was fortunate. The store was a hit. Selling plants was not, however, its only goal. Kaplon, Martin, and Morera wanted to guide cactus and succulent neophytes beyond a simple aesthetic appreciation of each cactus in its pot. If a customer was admiring an Oreocereus celsianus (commonly known as the old man of the mountain), she would learn before leaving the store that it comes from the high Andes, and that its fluffy mop of white hair evolved to defend it from the sun and the snow.

As the three men expanded their cactus collection and their depth of knowledge, they became increasingly captivated by historic, documentary-style photographs of cactuses and succulents in the wild, most of which were the output of previous generations of devoted cactus hunters. These older obsessives had travelled the world, sometimes taking considerable physical risks, just to see certain species in their native habitats, or to see them in bloom, or to search for others more rare. Over decades, evidence of what these explorers discovered, and of the extreme journeys they took, has been stashed away in bargain bins at cactus shows, in shoe boxes in collectors’ garages, and in dusty old slide carousels that reside with the region’s many cactus-and-succulent clubs. Kaplon, Martin, and Morera gathered as much of this archival material as they could, and eventually decided to put several hundred pictures, drawn from twenty-two explorers’ archives and spanning eighty years, into a new book. They researched and edited the images, conducted interviews with some of the photographer-explorers, and now are preparing to publish the result, titled “ Xerophile: Cactus Photographs from Expeditions of the Obsessed .”

In the same way that a bouquet of wildflowers is lovely but banal while an alpine meadow of blooming wildflowers is astonishing and sublime, these pictures demonstrate how arresting the sight of ancient, alien cactuses in the places they grow wild can be. What is immediately striking in the photos is the unimaginable sizes and shapes of various species, whether gigantic or minuscule, phallic or globose. In one image, several Ferocactus diguetii (giant barrel cactus), photographed in Baja California, Mexico, rise from a clearing, resembling the Jolly Green Giant’s extremities if he were standing underground and all you could see above ground were his fat fingertips (or perhaps another appendage) sticking up from the dry, rocky soil. Another shot of the same species shows a woman with a backpack staring up at a Ferocactus diguetii in disbelief. She is less than half its height and a fraction of its girth. In Chile, a species known as Copiapoa columna-alba is similarly huge, erect, and barrelled—if much harder and denser than Ferocactus . One plant in the book is estimated to be at least five hundred years old, “making it a juvenile at the time of Columbus,” the caption reads. Other clumps of Copiapoa depicted could be more than a thousand years old. One of my favorite photos, shot in Quebrada del Toro, in Argentina, shows many tall Trichocereus (sometimes called torch cactus) growing like menhirs among old gravestones in an abandoned cemetery.

While all of those large cactuses are most commonly seen in nurseries and plant shops as tiny nubs in petite terra-cotta pots, there are many rare, sought-after, mostly unknown species that never grow bigger than a nickel. The so-called belly plant, which lives on mudflats in Mexico, requires a searcher to be on her belly to find it. Rebutia schatzliana , in Bolivia, is smaller than a fingernail (as seen in a picture comparing the two) and grows a glorious miniature red flower. Then, there is the most lovable (and possibly the tiniest) tiny cactus in the world: Blossfeldia liliputana . Its mature size is ten millimetres, and its species name derives from the fictional country of Lilliput, created by Jonathan Swift, in “Gulliver’s Travels.” Native to northern Argentina and southern Bolivia, it often grows on sheer mudstone cliffs or tree bark, usually close to a waterfall. When it blooms, its nearly microscopic white-and-pink flowers are best seen with a magnifying glass.

“Xerophile” is, in sum, a catalogue of wonders that most of us will never get to see in person. Even if we knew where to find these plants in the wild, only a small number of people have enough interest, or obsession, to actually seek them out. Meanwhile, though, potted cactuses and succulents have become the “it” plants—hip, exotic, and, increasingly, ubiquitous. In London, a young woman recently opened a cactus boutique called Prick, inspired in part by the Cactus Store in Los Angeles. And in June, Kaplon, Martin, and Morera opened a pop-up store in a makeshift greenhouse in New York City’s Chinatown. But perhaps it’s fitting that cactuses and succulents are today’s botanical vogue. They represent what people crave and aspire to, as climate change advances and democratic institutions retreat: they can survive the harshest weather and the bleakest landscapes. They are both irreverent and dignified. They are strong and resilient, and will endure for centuries, even millennia.

Still, most people will never want to own a plant like Welwitschia mirabilis —one of the most bizarre succulents in the world, and the rarest plant for sale at the pop-up Cactus Store in Chinatown. It grows wild in the Namib, an ancient, stark desert along the Namibian coast, and it has only two leaves, which keep slowly growing—wrapping, curling, and ripping—into giant, six-foot-long tangles. Some are estimated to be two thousand years old. The Welwitscia in the store is an ugly little two-leaved weed. To the obsessed, however, it’s a work of art.

http://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/whats-missing-from-an-inconvenient-sequel-al-gores-new-climate-change-documentary,newyorker,"What’s Missing from “An Inconvenient Sequel,” Al Gore’s New Climate-Change Documentary",[],"In one of the most memorable moments of Al Gore’s new climate-change documentary, “An Inconvenient Sequel,” Gore refers to a sequence from the film’s 2006 predecessor, the Oscar-winning “An Inconvenient Truth.” The most criticized scene in that movie, he tells an audience of climate-change activists, was an animation showing how a combination of sea-level rise and storm surges could flood the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, then under construction in lower Manhattan. “People said, ‘That’s ridiculous. What a terrible exaggeration,’ ” Gore recalls. A moment later, on the screen behind him, the animated flood is replaced by news footage of Hurricane Sandy, which in late 2012 flooded the main floor of the unfinished museum with seven feet of black, debris-filled water. Several days after the storm, in a briefing on recovery efforts, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said, “There is a wakeup call here, and that is climate change and our vulnerability to it. It was true ten years ago, it was true five years ago. It is undeniable today.”

Eleven years ago, when “An Inconvenient Truth” was released, the effects of climate change were still, for most of us, the stuff of animations and projections. The connection between global warming and extreme weather, though well established in computer models, was difficult to demonstrate in the real world; as scientists routinely reminded the public, no single event—not even one as devastating as Hurricane Katrina—could be confidently attributed to humanity’s impact on the planet. Scientists’ characteristic caution, combined with the George W. Bush Administration’s deep hostility toward climate science and emissions reductions, insured that in the United States, at least, the ramifications of climate change were almost always presented to the public as theoretical and highly uncertain. The souped-up PowerPoint presentation that was “An Inconvenient Truth” effectively separated facts from muddle, and Gore’s earnest, insistent monotone, for so long a political handicap, found its most successful application.

Today, both the causes and the effects of climate change are clearer, and while some people have been harder hit than others, few of us are totally untouched; the news, as Gore puts it in a practiced bit of dark humor, has become “like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation.” The former Vice-President is still giving, and constantly updating, his presentation, and it is now filled with footage from climate-related disasters, ranging from the 2012 inundation of the 9/11 memorial to the painful, ongoing recovery from Typhoon Haiyan , the intense 2013 storm that killed more than six thousand people in the Philippines and affected some eleven million others throughout Southeast Asia. After a 2015 heat wave killed more than twelve hundred Pakistanis, Gore reports, cemeteries in the city of Karachi prepared for the following summer by digging anticipatory mass graves.

“An Inconvenient Sequel,” which opened in select cities on Friday and will open nationwide next week, arrives on the heels of a widely shared New York magazine article by David Wallace-Wells. The piece describes, in dramatic terms, the worst-case repercussions of climate change. “Absent a significant adjustment to how billions of humans conduct their lives, parts of the Earth will likely become uninhabitable, and other parts horrifically inhospitable, as soon as the end of this century,” Wallace-Wells writes. Some climatologists objected to the article’s characterizations of their work, but the real controversy centered on its approach. Michael Mann, the director of the Earth System Science Center, at Pennsylvania State University, declared that he was “not a fan of this sort of doomist framing,” and the sociologist Daniel Aldana Cohen described it as “climate disaster porn.” Wallace-Wells, for his part, acknowledged that his piece was “alarmist,” and proudly so. “We should be alarmed,” he wrote after its publication. (Earlier this month, the biologist Paul Ehrlich used a similar defense after co-authoring a study that warned of a coming “ annihilation ” of vertebrates. “I am an alarmist,” Ehrlich told the Washington Post . “My colleagues are alarmists. We’re alarmed, and we’re frightened. And there’s no other way to put it.”)

Psychologists have studied the dynamics of what advertisers call “ fear appeals ,” and they have found that while fear is very good at getting our attention, it’s not very good at keeping it. For that, the scary stuff must be followed by solutions that are small enough to be practical but large enough to be meaningful. Wallace-Wells’s article, “The Uninhabitable Earth,” successfully got attention, quickly becoming the most-viewed article in New York ’s history. But it offers little in the way of fixes, nodding briefly to the allure—if not the wisdom—of geoengineering and suggesting that civilization will eventually cobble together a substantive response to climate change, if only because the alternative is so appalling. “An Inconvenient Sequel,” which is a work of advocacy rather than journalism, pivots efficiently away from its disaster reel and toward solutions, cheering the rise of cheaper renewables and the promise of the Paris climate accord, even in the wake of the U.S.’s withdrawal. But its tight focus on Gore means that grassroots climate activists —many of whom were galvanized by Gore’s first film, and by the hundreds of trainings he has held in the years since—get short shrift. For the most part, they are shown sitting in auditoriums, listening raptly to Gore’s presentation. A long segment of the film is devoted to Gore’s behind-the-scenes negotiations with the Indian delegation at the Paris conference—which, while procedurally interesting, is hardly the sort of thing that most viewers can try at home.

Intentionally or unintentionally, “The Uninhabitable Earth” leaves room for something “An Inconvenient Sequel” does not: grief. The present and possible future ravages of climate change, on our own species and others, are enormously, often overwhelmingly sad, and most of us would rather not contemplate them. Wallace-Wells, as a journalist, isn’t professionally obligated to pivot away from the worst-case scenarios, and he makes the unusual decision to leave us staring at them. The vantage isn’t pleasant, but its provision feels, oddly, like a gesture of respect: for once, we’re given a chance to absorb and reflect, and, in time, find our own way to a response.

I saw “An Inconvenient Sequel” on a hot July night in Portland, Oregon, at a screening hosted by the environmental group Renew Oregon and attended by Governor Kate Brown. Brown has committed her state to meeting the emissions-reduction goals set by the Paris accord, but most paths to those goals require a price on carbon, and Oregon legislators have so far failed to approve a bill that would do so. At the screening, she announced, to enthusiastic applause, that she would work to pass a state “cap and invest” bill in 2018. “I think the rest of the world needs to see Americans, and Oregonians, standing up,” she told me later. “We must participate, and we must be part of the solution.”

After the credits rolled, Shilpa Joshi, a Renew Oregon staffer, stood to speak to the audience, and acknowledged the weight of the suffering we had just witnessed. “My family is from India, and it resonates with me on a deep level,” she said. She then described how audience members could help build support for a clean-energy economy in Oregon, detailing the kind of right-sized solutions that the movie had only touched upon. “Change at the local level is the best way to create real change in our state, and in our country, and in our world,” she reminded her listeners. No matter how climate change is framed—no matter how sunny or doleful the vision—it’s what happens off the screen, and off the page, that will decide whether the planet remains habitable."

http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-justin-bieber-got-banned-from-performing-in-china,newyorker,Why Justin Bieber Got Banned from Performing in China,[],"Until last week, the Dalai Lama had fairly little in common with Justin Bieber. Then the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture issued an injunction against the twenty-three-year-old pop star, who was in the middle of a global tour, prohibiting him from performing in China. (On Monday, Bieber announced that he was cutting his tour short.) “Justin Bieber is a gifted singer,” the bureau acknowledged, in a statement released on July 21st. “But in order to maintain order in the Chinese market and purify the Chinese performance environment, it is not suitable to bring in badly behaved entertainers.”

The Chinese government, which is not in the habit of divulging the logic of its edicts, didn’t elaborate on the “bad behavior” that got Bieber blacklisted, but one can imagine that his past visits to Asia may have had something to do with it. It’s unlikely, for instance, that being carried up the Great Wall by bodyguards, as the pop star did on a tour in 2013, won him plaudits from Beijing officials. Even worse was Bieber’s infamous 2014 visit to Tokyo’s Yasukuni Shrine, which honors the war dead, including those who inflicted atrocities upon Chinese and Korean civilians before and during the Second World War. Bieber, who seemed to have stumbled upon the shrine by chance, posted photos of his visit to Instagram with the same thoughtless self-assurance that led him to muse, on a visit to the Anne Frank House, the following year, that he hoped the teen-age Holocaust victim “would have been a belieber.” Apparently, the Biebs is slow to learn a lesson.

Of course, Bieber is far from the first celebrity that the Chinese government has attempted to ban from the country. In 2008, at a concert in Shanghai, the Icelandic singer Björk infuriated officials by shouting “Tibet, Tibet” at the end of her song “Declare Independence.” In response, China’s culture ministry issued a statement proclaiming that “any artistic group or individual who has ever engaged in activities which threaten our national sovereignty will not be allowed in.” The ban also included entertainers who “threaten national unity” and “violate religious policy or cultural norms.” Since then, the ministry, which vets all foreign acts, has denied entry to everyone from Oasis and Lady Gaga to Brad Pitt and Richard Gere for their embrace of the Free Tibet movement. In 2012, when Elton John dedicated a performance in Beijing “to the spirit and talent” of Ai Weiwei , the Chinese dissident artist and activist, he was interviewed by the police immediately after the performance.

What sets Bieber apart from previous celebrities non gratae, though, is the relatively apolitical nature of his violations, which presumably stem more from childish stupidity or swaggering bravado than from a calculated campaign of dissent. Yet the Chinese government’s refusal to let Bieber’s antics slide signals the shifting nature of censorship in a country that is trying to reconcile its system of stringent political control with the porousness of modern culture. In the age of globalization and social media, cultural hegemony knows no borders: a global pop icon—even a merely feckless, insolent one—can threaten to infiltrate an autocratic state, forcing its leaders to reappraise the meaning and methodology of maintaining “order” and “purity.”

Bieber’s behavior might seem innocuous enough to a Western audience (he has, after all, devoted considerable energy to saying sorry ), but consider it in contrast to that of TFBoys, a prodigiously popular boy band that has been called “China’s answer to Justin Bieber: young, fresh and cute.” Instead of singing about crushes and bubble-gum romance, the Fighting Boys, as they are known, croon about homework, the joy of domestic chores, and their hopes of winning the Nobel Prize. In 2014, the year after the band was founded—the same year Bieber was caught peeing in a mop bucket in public—its lead singer, Junkai Wang, posted a video of himself singing wistfully about the responsibilities that come with getting older; it was shared more than a hundred and fifty million times. Chinese observers have called the band’s three members “the teen-age sons every mother dreams about.” They are also the kind of performers that China’s state-controlled media dream about. In 2015, the band released a song and music video titled “We are the Heirs of Communism,” which opens on a schoolyard of solemn children sporting their Communist red scarves and goes on to praise the glories of the Party. Last year, the group was invited to perform in CCTV’s New Year’s Gala, an annual state-sponsored televised variety show, which melds entertainment with nationalistic propaganda—and happens to be the most watched show in the world.

To the Chinese government, Justin Bieber is a “controversial young foreigner” because even his apolitical antics represent a reckless individualism that’s perilous to the Party’s mission of insuring loyalty. The scope and spread of Western pop culture, with its potent, if indirect, messages of rebellious aspiration and individual desire, are inherently disturbing to an authoritarian state that likes to think of its citizens as dependent and governable children. Ground rules must be set, and corrupting influences extricated early, even in a family of 1.4 billion. In its statement last week, the culture bureau’s spokesperson wrote, in the tone of an irritated teacher penning her midterm report, that, “as Justin Bieber matures,” she hopes that “he may continue to improve his own words and actions and truly become a singer beloved by the public.” Whether Bieber will mature beyond his juvenile escapades is an open question, but one thing is clear: to be a performer admitted within China’s borders, it is the love of the Party—not the public—that counts."
http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson-sorkin/when-anthony-scaramucci-fell-in-love-with-donald-trump,newyorker,When Anthony Scaramucci Fell in Love with Donald Trump,[],"“Jake, I don’t care,” Anthony Scaramucci, Donald Trump’s new communications director , told Jake Tapper on Sunday, on CNN’s “ State of the Union .” Scaramucci added, “You know who doesn’t care? The President doesn’t care.” It was a line, and a sentiment, that Scaramucci has repeated often, in one form or another, over the past few days; there seems to be a lot that neither man cares about. In this instance, Scaramucci didn’t care about what Tapper suggested was an extravagant act of hypocrisy on his part. During the Republican primaries, Scaramucci had written a column for the Fox Business Network Web site warning against demagoguery and xenophobia, and saying that the G.O.P. faced “a moral debt restructuring, one caused by the reckless behavior of a man who knows a thing or two about bankruptcy.” Tapper, reasonably enough, took this to have been a criticism of the man who is now Scaramucci’s boss, and asked how many positions and principles Scaramucci was willing to renounce in return for a White House office. Scaramucci had already deleted tweets in which he’d declared himself pro-choice, pro gun control, and opposed to the conspiracy theories of climate-change denialists. Tapper suggested that people might think, “Wow, this guy is willing to suppress everything he believes in order to get close to power.” “Nonsense,” Scaramucci said. The whole question, to his mind, embodied everything that was wrong with Washington. He then compared himself to Winston Churchill and Ronald Reagan. He also mentioned that Trump had called him from Air Force One—what that was supposed to explain wasn’t clear—and that he loved the President.

Perhaps Scaramucci admires Trump’s knowledge of bankruptcy, perhaps especially moral bankruptcy, not as a degraded state but one in which some unprofitable principles can be written off and new, more marketable ones acquired. Scaramucci has a background in finance, and is currently disentangling himself from SkyBridge Capital, a fund that invests in other funds; Forbes estimated that a sale of his stake might yield close to eighty million dollars . (He also had a career in media, alongside his business ventures, as a host of shows like “Wall Street Week,” on the Fox Business Network.) Or maybe, as he told Tapper, he just saw the light during the campaign and realized that Trump would be “phenomenal” for America, and thus came by his flashy obsequiousness honestly, at least once other candidates he’d preferred, such as Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, had dropped out. It doesn’t entirely matter. This Administration is such an ethical morass that one can get lost wondering about the state of everybody’s soul. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, for example, had always openly loved Donald Trump, who is now doing his best to squish what is left of Sessions’s self-respect, by saying that he ought never to have hired him. Sessions apparently lost Trump’s affection by not acting to protect him from the many investigations into Russia’s role in the 2016 Presidential election.

Scaramucci is doing his best to make up for that lapse. When Tapper asked him about the investigation, he offered up the novel theory that, if the Russians had really been up to something, we would never have known—“they’re super confident in their deception skills in hacking”—and thus the existence of evidence that they were, say, reaching out to the Trump campaign was actually proof that they were not. Scaramucci didn’t take credit for coming up with that one himself; he was repeating something “somebody said to me yesterday, I won’t tell you who.”

“I don’t know who this anonymous person is. . . .” Tapper protested.

“How about, how about it was the, how about it was the President, Jake?” Scaramucci said, with what, for reasons we may never understand, sounded like a note of triumph. The revelation of his source was bolstered by yet another reference to a communication from on high: “He called me from Air Force One.”

Scaramucci appears to believe that if he expresses enough delight in name-dropping and what his boss calls his “braggadocio”—playing up his persona as the Long Island guy who made good in Manhattan, known to friends and foes alike as “the Mooch”—it will come across as charming, or at least provide enough of a distraction to pass for an answer. When Tapper asked him if the President could pardon himself (Trump has reportedly asked his lawyers about this, and tweeted over the weekend that Presidential-pardon powers have no limit), Scaramucci said that he didn’t know. But, he added, “I took constitutional law from Larry Tribe”—a professor at Harvard Law School, which, as Scaramucci had already mentioned, he attended—“and if Professor Tribe is listening, I know he doesn’t like the President, but I did get an A-minus in your course.” Pressed on the question of pardon power, Scaramucci said that it “doesn’t matter anyway, because that is another one of those stupid hypotheticals. He’s not going to have to pardon himself, because he’s done absolutely nothing wrong. So, we don’t even have to worry about it.""

There are likely to be many craven, circular answers of this kind in a Scaramucci-run communications operation. On Friday, in his first engagement with the press, Scaramucci was asked whether he stood by Trump’s assertion that three million illegal votes were cast in the 2016 election. “So, if the President says it, let me do more research on it, but my guess is that there’s probably some level of truth to that,” Scaramucci said. It wasn’t clear that the press could expect that research to extend much further than into whether the President had said it and still believed it. It only underscored the question of what the press, or the public, could expect from Scaramucci.

Radical honesty doesn’t seem like an option. Neither does actually useful information on the workings of the executive branch, or of Congress. When he was asked, on Friday, why he believed that the President would get “a win” on health care, he said, “The President has really good karma, O.K.? And the world turns back to him. He’s genuinely a wonderful human being, and I think, as the members of Congress get to know him better and get comfortable with him, they’re going to let him lead them to the right things for the American people. So, I think we’re going to get the health care done.” Despite lines like that, there is a theory that Scaramucci will offer, if nothing else, lively engagement and coherent sentences—a contrast, in other words, to Sean Spicer , the increasingly gloomy press secretary who fled the building on news of Scaramucci’s appointment. For a while, watching Spicer was edifying in a backward sort of way, in that his flailing made the senselessness of the President’s positions manifest. But watching him had begun to feel a little cruel, his humiliation by the White House too deliberate. On Friday, Scaramucci offered a last jab when he said, of Spicer, “I love the guy, and I wish him well, and I hope he goes on to make a tremendous amount of money.”

Money: maybe then Trump would respect poor Spicer. It was a way of reminding everyone in the room that money was something that Scaramucci already has. In the Trump White House, though, he may be surprised at how little it buys him, and at what price."

During the Second World War, a million women served in the Soviet Army. This remarkable collection of testimonies, translated into English for the first time, is the earliest, and the most earnest, of the Nobel laureate’s chronicles of Soviet and post-Soviet lives. Sitting at kitchen tables, Alexievich coaxes out of the women stories that describe a reality vastly different from the officially sanctioned version, with its glorifying tidiness. She asks them, “Was there love during the war?,” and what was it like, when death was so near? They speak guardedly but vividly of fleeting encounters, deep relationships, unexpressed feelings. To the women, love was “the only personal event in wartime. All the rest is common—even death.”

Hunger , by Roxane Gay (HarperCollins) . “The story of my body is not a story of triumph,” Gay declares at the outset of her powerful, unvarnished memoir. After being gang-raped by a classmate and his friends at the age of twelve, Gay began to gain weight. Now she is what doctors call “super morbidly obese.” Threaded through the book are musings on fatness and its place in contemporary culture, in TV shows like “The Biggest Loser” and in the craze for weight-loss surgery. Although Gay is a celebrated writer, she resists characterizing her life as a straightforward success. Her memoir is often repetitive, but its vulnerability is spellbinding. “Here I am showing you the ferocity of my hunger,” Gay writes. There is a triumph in that.

Flesh and Bone and Water , by Luiza Sauma (Scribner) . This mysterious début novel begins with a letter to André Cabral, a middle-aged doctor from Brazil, working in London, from Luana, his former maid’s daughter—a girl with eyes like “trampled leaves.” It is his first contact with her since he left for England, when he was eighteen, soon after his mother died in a car accident. Flashbacks depict André’s life in the following years, and his intimate and uneasy relationship to Luana and to the Brazilian class structure. Though the narrative relies too heavily on Cabral, Brazil is marvellously conjured: full of hot, smoky sunrises and manioc pancakes, chilled coconut milk and “the salty violence of Ipanema.”

Little Sister , by Barbara Gowdy (Tin House) . During a particularly rainy week in Toronto, whenever a thunderstorm hits, Rose, a thirty-four-year-old who runs a dilapidated movie theatre, is transported out of her body and into that of Harriet, a beautiful and depressed book editor who is secretly pregnant by a married man. For Rose, being in Harriet’s body is a thrilling respite from caring for her mother, who has dementia, and from her boyfriend, who is an overbearing bore. It also allows her to access new memories of her sister and the circumstances of her death, when they were young. Any qualms about the novel’s strange premise are swept away by Gowdy’s finely balanced prose; we are as entrenched in the characters’ lives as Rose is in Harriet’s body."

Kitchen Box is a popular service that sends all the ingredients you need to make a home-cooked meal right to your door. No more planning ahead or grocery shopping! My recent Kitchen Box had all the ingredients for a farro salad that was delicious and easy to make. It also came with two mannequin arms and a mannequin foot. Must be some kind of mixup. Visit Kitchen Box online and sign up today. Now back to the podcast and my conversation with David Frum.

For less than ten dollars a meal, Kitchen Box will provide you with all the ingredients to make a healthy and affordable dinner at home. Since signing up for Kitchen Box, I’ve made risotto Milanese and roasted asparagus in my own kitchen. I’ve also assembled a full mannequin with the mannequin limbs they’ve been sending me. No one at Kitchen Box will explain why I keep getting plastic body parts along with their easy-to-make meal ingredients, and I couldn’t not assemble them into a human figure—whom I call Dannon—could I? Just leaving the limbs around my apartment would have been creepy, so it just made sense to put them together and dress the resulting mannequin in cycling gear that I never use. Try Kitchen Box today. Now back to my conversation with Thomas Friedman about the challenges of globalization.

You don’t have to worry about what you’re going to make for dinner: let Kitchen Box take care of that. My recent Kitchen Box came with all the ingredients I needed for simple quinoa enchiladas, along with enough mannequin parts to complete an entire second mannequin, as well as a few extra body limbs I’ve assembled into a kind of mannequin mutant. My first Kitchen Box mannequin, Dannon, is just going to have to accept that we have company now that Jeremy—whom I named after my father, who left me as a child to follow Puddle of Mudd on tour—and little Skimby are living with us. Don’t forget to use the promo code M-E-N-U and get one week free. Now back to my interview with Ta-Nehisi Coates.

Have you tried Kitchen Box yet? You can tell Kitchen Box your food preferences and they’ll send you a meal that incorporates your dietary needs. I told them I wanted a high-protein vegan meal, and they sent me all the ingredients for white-bean pasta with marinara sauce, along with a wig in the style of a pageboy haircut. Is the wig for me, or for one of my mannequins? Dannon likes to keep his hair short so it’s easy to manage when biking, and Jeremy’s trying to grow his hair out to look like Puddle of Mudd’s Wes Scantlin. As for Skimby, he doesn’t have a body part that can properly be called a head. Kitchen Box: fresh ingredients are always on the menu. Now back to my interview with no one, just me talking to two mannequins who still won’t answer a damn thing about Wall Street regulation.

Hey, did you know Kitchen Box comes with dessert? At least that’s what they say: I wouldn’t know because the last thing they sent me was a fully constructed mannequin in a crate with the Kitchen Box logo and a note attached that just said, “Please continue.” Making matters worse, Dannon and Jeremy think Skimby is an abomination. None of Kitchen Box’s online reviews mention this sort of thing happening to any of their other subscribers; they only talk about how so many subscribers’ lives have been changed by eating at home more. If that’s a change you want to make, sign up for Kitchen Box today.

They ate Skimby, Kitchen Box! Dannon, Jeremy, and Tall Pageboy feasted on his confusing body when I stepped outside to pick up my Seamless delivery! Like he was just some easy-to-make meal for three cannibalistic mannequins. Fine, you win! I will return to preparing meals at home, Kitchen Box! I accept that your vision to bring fresh ingredients directly to my door is the only way to eat. Now back to my conversation with Neil deGrasse Tyson."
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/christina-the-astonishing-1150-1224,newyorker,Christina the Astonishing (1150-1224),[],"Audio: Kirstin Valdez Quade reads. Nevertheless her sisters and friends never stopped their persecution, for after she had returned to a place where they could seize her, they bound her fast with a heavy wooden yoke and fed her like a dog with only a little bread and water. . . . No one there had compassion for her wretchedness. —Thomas de Cantimpré (1201-72) How She Was Led Forth from the Body and How She Lived Again

The priest holds the host aloft, the linen sleeves of his alb falling around him like wings. He intones the Agnus Dei, and we sing with him. I can scarcely form the words, my throat is so clotted with grief. Beside me, my sister Gertrude tightens her grasp on my hand. Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi — Christina lies in her coffin, her cheeks sunken, her slender hands crossed over her heart. Now, with her troubled soul gone, Christina is easier to look at; alive, even in sleep, she kicked and growled and twitched. For the first time in the twenty-one years I’ve known her, my sister seems at peace. A grave awaits her in the churchyard, a hole sliced into the earth. Water pools in the cold mud at the bottom, flashing in the sunlight and reflecting the sky. We were five in our family, then three, and now we are just two, and even as I weep for our little sister I thank God that it is Christina in the coffin and not Gertrude, the sister I can’t live without. Miserere nobis. Have mercy on us. I think of our house on the edge of the village, hushed, veiled in honeysuckle. A thread of smoke rises faintly from the chimney, and the coals collapse into ash. I think of our lives as they will be from now on, tranquil and measured. As the music rises around me, I’m enveloped in an unfamiliar sweetness, as if some acid had been drained from my blood. Even this morning, on the way to the church, I couldn’t help noticing that the world was suddenly clean and raw, filled with new color and new light, everything unbearably radiant. I loved Christina, I did! I see this now. She was difficult, yes, unknowable, but I loved her. Generosity floods me, as clear and calm as well water—and gratitude, too, to God, who has let me weep for her. I remember Christina as an infant, that fretful tense-limbed creature. While our mother sat at the spinning wheel, I rocked Christina, begging her to settle. “Hush, hush, just rest now,” I said, and put my finger in her little palm. She gripped it but kept wailing. Now my whole body cries out to hold that memory of my sister’s hand around my finger. We begin the third invocation: Lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the world . . . . We sing, edging closer and closer to that final entreaty: Dona nobis pacem. Grant us peace. Perhaps if we’d hastened, outrun the melody, God might have listened. If we’d only got those last words out, He might have spared us our miracle. Instead: flight. The congregation gasps. I open my wet eyes, the prayer dead on my lips. How to make sense of this? The young woman up there in the rafters is no apparition. Christina was dead, and now she’s alive, eyes shocked and glittering. She perches above us in her gray shift, straddling the beam, dangling two thin legs. Her face is contorted, her color rising, as she wails down at us. She grips the beam, her long fingers pressed so hard against the wood—splintered and rough with adze marks—that afterward they will be bloody. We gaze up in amazement. Gertrude and I clutch each other, because we saw her dead on the floor of our house, cleaned her and dressed her and prayed over her, saw her loaded onto a cart and brought here. But now our sister is back, vibrant and fully herself. Her cries seem to be in another language, but for one refrain: “Why, why, why?” In the hours and days and years that follow, people will report that after my sister rose from the dead and flew high into the rafters of the church she shouted about Purgatory. They will tell of her journey there and back, and to Hell and Heaven, too, and of her interview with God. They will tell how, valuing her soul above others’, He gave her the choice between eternal Paradise and a return to a life of suffering for Him on Earth. But, as I watch my sister swaying and jabbering above me in the church, all I can think is that she has returned to punish me for my hypocrisy, for crying over her body, for thinking I ever loved her. Here Begins the Life of the Holy Christina

May of 1150 is unseasonably cold, and, on the morning that my youngest sister is born, ice glazes the budding trees. Since dawn, Gertrude and I have been waiting outside the house, leaning against the windowsill, the sleeves and fronts of our dresses smudged with whitewash. Our father is away with the flock, due back in a few days, so only Gertrude and I keep watch. Gertrude clutches a softening parsnip in her arms, murmurs to it. She is five, thirteen months younger than me. Already a red-lipped beauty, already a little mother. We try to peer through cracks in the shutters, listening to the cries within, but can’t make out our mother in the murk. Outside, everything is bright and still. No wind blows over the frozen ground. There is no birdsong at all this year. The birds have abandoned the Meuse Valley entirely for somewhere warmer: Spain, maybe. “She won’t live,” the midwife tells us on her way out. She tightens her shawl, then says over her shoulder, “The baby, I mean. I’m sorry. Your mother just needs to rest.” We watch her move down the road to the village. Our mother has lost babies before, so this news is sad, but expected. It’s our mother we’re worried about. With pounding hearts, Gertrude and I hold hands and step into the house. Inside, the air is hot from the stoked fire, thick with the smell of blood and smoke. Our mother turns her face from the light—or maybe she turns her face from us—and presses her cheek to the bedclothes. Christina, our new sister, flails naked on a cloth before the fire, blue-white and thin, full of mucus and outrage. “Give her here, Mara,” our mother says in a watery voice. Tears leak from the corners of her slit eyes. We kneel beside our squalling sister—Gertrude sets down her parsnip gently—and wrap her in the warmed cloth with our four clumsy hands. “Can she be my doll when she’s dead?” Gertrude asks. “Idiot,” I tell her kindly. “She’ll rot and stink, like any dead thing.” But Christina doesn’t die. As a scowling infant, she rejects the breast; later, she picks at her suppers. Yet she grows in spite of herself. At night, as Gertrude and I bend over our carding, Christina watches us, sharp-eyed and peevish, breathing wetly. The Saint’s Childhood

We sell our sheep in the markets of Brustem and Ordingen and Saint-Trond. The three of us accompany our father. Gertrude and I hurry the sheep when they lag with a whack on their spongy bottoms. Christina will not keep up, and she won’t keep to the road, either, but darts along from tree to tree, the underbrush snapping at her feet. Our father no longer raises his voice or drags Christina by the wrist or whips her for lollygagging; he could yell himself hoarse and whip his arm crippled, and still Christina wouldn’t obey. Only eight years old, and already she’s stymied him. One day, as we pass the great walled convent of St. Catherine’s, on the road to Saint-Trond, the gate is opened to allow a cart to pass through. “Gertrude,” I say, and grab her sleeve, because we’ve never seen the gate open. We peer into the cobbled yard while the porter argues with the driver and the sheep nudge our thighs with the bony points of their heads. The morning light seems warmer beyond the gatehouse; there, pink in the rising sun, is the chapel, with its crown of slender finials, there the abbey, all carved arches and gray stone. At the far end of the yard, an archway opens onto another courtyard, beyond which I glimpse a garden. I ache to be there, enclosed in that spot of green, to live day after measured day of prayer and work, each as full and serene as a rosary bead. It is six in the morning; the sisters are in the chapel reciting Prime. Somewhere behind these walls, the cloisters are quiet and waiting. Somewhere else, lay sisters tend to bees in straw apiaries or bend with rakes over rows of waxy cabbages. Then reins are shaken, the cart rattles through, and the gate is shut. “They found a baby in the walls,” Gertrude says. She takes my arm and gives a ram a kick in the side. “A tiny little skeleton. A nun had it in secret and closed it into the wall.” “Liar,” I say. “It’s like I’m actually walking.” “It’s true.” Gertrude presses her red lips, tosses her braid over her shoulder. “Isn’t it awful? A defenseless little baby.” She widens her eyes, as if she’d just had a delicious thought. “Maybe it wasn’t dead. Maybe it was still gurgling when she bricked it in.” “That doesn’t even make sense. Where would a nun get masonry tools?” “Poor Mara.” Gertrude touches my cheek in mock sympathy. “They wouldn’t take you anyway. Not with a sister possessed by the Devil.” We laugh and turn to watch Christina charging through the leaves, head forward, shoulders hunched and purposeful. She glances furtively over her shoulder, then hides behind an oak. Soon she peers around the trunk, eyes narrowed and suspicious, and, when she catches us looking, her expression is one of such loathing that the laugh withers in my throat. Gertrude shudders and squeezes my wrist. “Don’t go. Swear you won’t go and leave me with her.” “Hurry up, Christina!” I shout in a rage. Her hand is motionless on the gnarled bark. When she speaks, her voice is so shrill that you could cut your finger on it. “Leave me alone!”

There is, of course, no money to pay my dowry to the convent, and, though I pray and cry and beg God and my parents, this fact does not change. I apply to the abbess through our parish priest, but the sisters won’t take me as an oblate or a charity case. “Just as well,” my father says. “We couldn’t spare you,” my mother says. They mean, but they don’t say, that Christina is becoming yet stranger. Neighbors find her curled tight in their pigpens, crouched like an animal in ditches along the roads, hidden in the marsh grass, knee deep in stinking mud. Left alone, the sheep wander; some are recovered in the woods among the trees, some are never found at all. Trinity

The winter that Christina turns seventeen, our parents die of fever—first Father, then Mother. We’re alone now, three sisters. With our parents dead, it’s even harder to picture our futures. I still pray every day to join the convent of St. Catherine’s, but God has made it clear that He has other concerns. Gertrude is in love with Thomas, the turner’s son, but it’s uncertain whether her beauty and her share of our flock are enough inducement for any suitor to take on a lunatic for a sister-in-law. Anyway, neither of us will leave the other with Christina. Christina leans against the doorframe and watches us cry. She looks as she always does: lips colorless and peeling, neck cabled, sallow skin stretched over knobby joints. She is taller than us, big-boned, still entirely without breasts. She has blue smudges under her eyes, as if thumbs have pressed hard against the rims of her sockets. “You might be happy for our parents, Mara,” she tells me. And, though I despise her for her piety, I am abashed, because what would the sisters at St. Catherine’s say? “Of course. You’re right.” I swipe my fingers down my cheeks. “They’re with God.” “No,” Christina says. She folds her bony arms. The bridge of her nose is taut and white. When she speaks, she sounds as if she were reciting catechism. “They were disgusting. I dreamed of a wheel set high on a hill, under a golden sun. Mother was stretched naked across, and the Devil spun her, cudgelling her until her bones shattered and the marrow spilled to the dirt. Father wove her limbs in and out of the spokes.” Gertrude looks as though she might be sick. Her fist is pressed to her teeth. “They aren’t with God,” Christina says with finality. “Purgatory at best. But better there, where they can atone, than on this corrupt ground.” She looks around our home—hearth, table, loom, bed—and her mouth twists in distaste. That spring, twelve of our ewes have stillbirths. We pile the dead lambs, gleaming with amniotic fluid, their wool fine and tight-curled. I begin the work of skinning them. Her First Holy Death

Christina begins to have fits, then recovers, then has fits again. Gertrude and I learn to hold her kicking legs, to brace her head and fish for her tongue. It’s the only time that we touch her now, the only time she’ll let us. We do our best to nurse her, but she turns away from the filling stews, the thick bread slathered in butter. She seems to live on air. The fit that kills her is just like all the others, except that, when our sister finally goes still, her chest doesn’t rise and her eyes don’t shiver beneath her blue lids. Gertrude touches her hand and begins to cry. Above us, beyond the roof of our little house and the swaying treetops, far beyond the clouds and the raucous currents, Christina is already taking God’s hand, already working out the details of her journey back to life. Here on earth, curds of blood spill from her open mouth and glisten on the flagstones. How Harshly She Suffered for Those Souls Detained in Purgatory, but Remained Unharmed in Body

After Christina’s resurrection, she spends her days perched in the branches of a yew on the road to town. She shrieks at people as they pass, accusing them of their sins, which, she says, she can smell on them, can see spread across their faces like fungus. No one is spared: “You, Curate! You with your lewd nocturnal pollutions!” She screams at Gertrude and me when we bleed, screams that we are filthy, that we make her sick. “Pigs, pigs, stinking pigs,” she chants. She takes our rags from where they soak in the washtub and flings them at the walls, where they stick, dripping brown water. She herself has never menstruated. “Whore!” she hisses at Gertrude when Thomas walks her to our door. Thomas reddens and slinks away, and Gertrude watches him go with dry eyes. She never cries anymore. Christina upturns the clothes box and shreds our shifts and kirtles. “Go naked like the harlots you are!” she screams. She takes the shears to our bed linen. Straw, feathers, matted tufts of yellowed wool, are strewn across the room like some barnyard massacre. When she smashes our mother’s crockery, the fragments scatter and rock on their curves. Christina is impossible. Not possible. And yet there she is, our sister, our flesh, howling and yanking her hair out in bleeding clumps. After Gertrude and I awake to her scratching at our faces, we bind her to her bed at night. Still, she twists loose, pummels us in our bed with the rolling pin, the kettle, the peel. Above us, her face passes in and out of a shaft of moonlight, and her expression is, oddly, one of terror. Please , God , I pray, help me understand this miracle , help me understand for what purpose You have returned her to us. He has a purpose—of course He must—but in her shrill judgments I hear nothing of His Son’s love. Perhaps she’s been sent back from the afterlife to test our capacity for love, and so I try to love her, but I can’t hide my heart from God or from myself. The more I pray, the worse things become. Christina grows sick with the smell of humanity: the sweat and garlic, the stagnant mouths and fusty wool. “Please don’t come near!” she begs us, her eyes filling. Her own body revolts her, too, and she does her best to remove the offending parts. She refuses all food. She slices into the skin of her belly with a shearing blade, thrusts her hands elbow-deep into the fire until the skin blackens and blisters. She pitches herself into the wide gray Meuse, where she floats face down among chips of ice. Her arms and legs are splayed stiff, as if in rapture, and she gasps into the water. The crowds are small or they are large, but always Gertrude and I are there, calling to our sister, begging the men to drag her back to shore. All the while, I pray for her to slip from their grasp and to give herself to that sucking dark current. But she is always returned to us. Her hair dries, her wounds heal. The crowds disperse and leave the three of us alone. In a moment of calm, as Christina lies curled on the bed, eyes wide, I touch a tendril of hair at her temple, as soft as a baby’s, and she winces. I want to embrace her, crush my love into her, but I’m afraid there isn’t enough to do the trick. “Why do you hurt yourself, Christina?” I ask. “Why does God need you to hurt so much?” I have other questions, too. How will we get through this? What if this never ends? What if God doesn’t let any of us die? Later, they will say that my sister suffered for the souls in Purgatory. They will say she mortified her flesh and starved her body so that, one by one, the waiting souls might be released like bubbles into Heaven. But for now the alderman visits us, warns us to keep her in check. “Of course,” Gertrude and I say, but after he leaves we look at each other, helpless. How She Expounded with the Spirit of Prophecy “I filed for divorce on the grounds of mental exhaustion.”

Father Luc is young, with full purple lips. We knew him as a boy, when he and the other small children followed Gertrude around, begging for stories, crying to her over their scratched knees. He was in love with her then, his little red face flushing still redder when she knelt to him. Now he’s stern when Gertrude and I appear at his door, brightening only when we mention demonic possession. On the appointed day, Father Luc and the deacons and the aldermen arrive to bear Christina to the church. When they seize her, she whips her head around to us, eyes pleading, and it’s clear that she reads our betrayal in our faces. “It’s for your own good!” I call to her, my voice shaking, as Gertrude and I trail after her. “I swear, Christina, they’ll cure you!” She screams in terror, kicks in their arms, retches. In the sanctuary, Father Luc indicates the bench where we are to sit during the exorcism, but once he starts we can’t be still. Gertrude and I press against each other and the stone wall as if we might slip through it and away from what is taking place before us. Father Luc begins his chants. Now Christina is nude before these men, every part of her thrumming with fury. The fine hairs on her body catch the candlelight, outlining her in gold. We watch in hope and horror as Father Luc starts flogging the Devil out of her. Amid her ravings, Christina shrieks that the city of Jerusalem has been taken by the wicked Saracens. She says other things as well—that the Pope is a whoreson and Father Luc is a buggering goat and that I eat dung and suckle at Gertrude’s breast. But, later, Father Luc will remember only the Saracens. Her eyes roll, her fists clench, her tongue flicks in and out like a flame. Little boys crack the church door to peer in, then slam it shut in terror. And then, as the priest lifts his arm to bring down another lash, Christina meets my eye. Her face is as calm as a moon in a daytime sky. She holds my gaze, and for a moment all I can hear is the steady, tenacious ticking of her heart.

Weeks later, Father Luc visits our house, falls to his knees, thick lips trembling, and begs Christina’s forgiveness. Reports have come from across the sea. On the day of Christina’s exorcism, the Saracens stormed the Holy Land. How She Was Driven by the Spirit to Live by Begging

Events happen more quickly now. Word travels that God whispers into Christina’s ear. Priests and holy men arrive at our door, shoo Gertrude and me from the house, spend hours seeking her counsel. Christina won’t eat the food we put out for her, won’t sleep in her bed. Instead, she begs along the road. Sometimes she will eat what people offer; more often she will refuse it, waving the bread in the air, pointing at her benefactor, shouting that it is rancid with his sin. “He gives me the bowels of toads!” she cries, thrusting the loaf back at him. “Lord, why does this man torture me with his poison?” Corruption, infidelity, blasphemy. Ordinary people no longer come near us, because they fear what Christina knows and what she might accuse them of. They fear her terrible, lonely holiness. Miracle

The stories will claim that when Christina was starving, chained in a dungeon by Gertrude and me, denied food and water, sunlight and air, her virginal breasts began to flow with a liquid of clearest sweet oil, which nourished her wasted body and healed her festering wounds. I can say only that our house is not equipped with a dungeon. We own no chains. And Christina’s breasts were never more than a child’s. But, oh, the wonders Christina works. Gertrude becomes pregnant. This is a secret between the two of us and Thomas. Christina, of course, can’t know. Thomas is sweetly, shyly thrilled, eager to marry her, and so we gather in the cold church. Gertrude wears a new linen veil, a gown of fine lilac wool. Thomas stands straight beside her, in scarlet hose and marigold tunic. I am there, and Christina, and Thomas’s enormous family: smiling aunts and grandparents and cousins. They are jolly people, prosperous, well liked in the district and beyond. They now approve of the match, because, with news of Christina’s holiness spreading, what was once a liability has become an honor. Gertrude is vivid with joy, and I am, too, because after so long I am about to belong to a family again. When the bride and groom kneel before Father Luc, Christina stands. We raise our heads from our prayers to see her point at Gertrude. “Slut,” she says in a clear voice. She turns to Thomas’s family, then to Father Luc in entreaty. “She and her bastard have no place in this holy house.” Father Luc falters, wets his lips with nervousness, and looks around. Thomas takes Gertrude’s hand in both of his. “Well, can any of you say who the father is?” Christina presses. If in this moment Gertrude were to smile and shake her head, then turn back to Father Luc with an expectant expression, perhaps the ceremony might go forward, the marriage be sealed. After all, everyone in this place has heard this and worse from Christina. But instead Gertrude pulls her hand from Thomas’s and pushes herself up. He reaches for Gertrude’s hem, then withdraws. His expression is pained and uncertain. Defend yourself!, I want to call to my sister. Tears stream down her set face as if they had nothing to do with her. Thomas looks out at the rustling, murmuring congregation, at his parents’ angry expressions, and at Christina, who stands with her hands folded serenely before her. Now he rises as well, squares his shoulders. He meets Gertrude’s gaze as she watches him, waiting for his decision. His own eyes fill. “I’m sorry,” he says with a sob and leaves the church. The rest of his family files out behind him, until only the priest and we three sisters are left. Gertrude is rigid in my arms, no longer crying. Christina stands alone before the altar, tall and unsmiling, triumphant. Even Father Luc turns away from her. “Please, Gertrude,” I say, begging for something I can’t express. I press my lips against her hair. Over the next weeks and months, Gertrude becomes lush and pink with the baby, and, despite her shame, despite her grief over the loss of Thomas, she has bursts of happiness that last longer and longer as her belly grows. “I’ve always wanted a baby,” she tells me when I come in sweaty from the pasture. She pauses over her kneading to press a floury palm against the child’s kicking foot. And, because Gertrude is happy, I am happy, too. What does it matter that we’ll raise this child alone? We’re already outcasts. Then the strange thing happens. At first we don’t notice—how could we imagine it was possible? Christina begins to starve the baby out of our sister. Though Christina refuses food even more strenuously than ever, she doesn’t weaken or sicken. Instead, it is Gertrude who wastes away, despite eating the bread and honey and soft sheep’s cheese I place before her. Now she resembles Christina, all clavicle and shoulders under her dress. Her head looks big, her blond hair sparse around her face, her eyes wide and dark. Her round belly is all that’s left of her. And, as if to compensate for my sisters, I fatten until I am made up of circles: buttocks, thighs, massive barren abdomen. My skin strains to contain me. “Please!” Gertrude begs Christina. But Christina seems to have abandoned her shrieking mood. She blinks, unreadable. Gertrude holds her belly in skeletal arms. She sinks to her knees before Christina, pulls at Christina’s limp hands. “Please let me keep it,” she begs. “Please, Christina. I know you can intercede with God. Please do this for me.” Christina just gazes out over the top of Gertrude’s head. Then one day, in the eighth month, the belly drops away, too. “You’re welcome,” Christina tells Gertrude, but as she says it she looks at me and sighs deeply, happily, as if after a rich dinner. “Isn’t this what you wanted, Mara?” Gertrude says bitterly. “A life without men or children? A life apart?” How Greatly She Was Venerated

Christina is called away, first for weeks at a time, then months and years. Holy houses, noble estates: everywhere, great gates swing open to her. She stays with hermits and holy women, basking in her celebrity, prophesying famine and slaughter. Always with a taste for catastrophe, my sister. She hears the confessions of counts and noblemen and bishops. Occasionally news of Christina trickles back to us: she waters with her tears the places where men are accustomed to sin; she goes to the gallows and suspends herself among thieves; she enters the graves of dead men and there makes lamentation for the sins of men. She moves around the country with astounding freedom, travelling far beyond the Meuse Valley. Then she disappears to the mountains, to live with the recluse Iutta. With Christina gone, Gertrude and I are not enough to fill our home. That calm life I once imagined—the whir of the spinning wheel, new cloth blowing on the line, fat sheep dotting the field, our easy laughter—is impossible. We avoid each other’s eyes as we work; we speak only the barest, most essential words. Gertrude still mourns the baby, but silently, holding her grief away from me as if it were itself an infant and I a wolf. “Hi, my name is Brad and I have a beard.” My prayers won’t cohere; the words slip from my mind, and God, who once was everything, has vanished. With Christina gone, I see only my own ugliness, and my vision shrinks and aches until I can barely stand to open my eyes. This can’t last, and it doesn’t. When Gertrude tells me she is leaving to marry, I nod and say, “Of course, I understand.” But I don’t wish her well, out loud or in my heart. I don’t wish her cheerful friends, a bustling hearth, a sweet-tempered housemaid. I don’t wish her babies. When the time comes for her to pack, I wrap myself in my shawl and head out to the pasture. “Someone has to watch the sheep,” I say. But, instead of watching the sheep, I stand on the hillside overlooking the house, imagining Gertrude folding her clothes into a box, choosing from among our mother’s things. She will leave the best things for me, and even this gesture will feel like reproach. A piece of lace, a dimpled copper pot. Gertrude is to travel to Bruges in the company of the old man who will be her husband and his six grown sons. In a grand cathedral, she will say her vows before strangers. After their cart is loaded, I stand with her on the doorstep and offer her a stony kiss goodbye; although I know I will never see her again, I’m determined that she understand that in leaving she has betrayed me. The cart sets off, bearing my beloved sister away. I long to run after her, but I anchor myself against the doorjamb. Her Wondrous Song

For nine years, Christina lives with the recluse Iutta, and, when she finally returns from her holy wilderness, the nuns of St. Catherine’s make ready to welcome her. When I hear the news, I imagine them lined up in the cloisters to greet her, and, though I think that by now I am beyond envy, still my stomach clenches. Just once, when I am nearly sixty, I visit St. Catherine’s. It’s morning after a night of rain, the sky an even, bright gray, and puddles fill the yard. The place is much as I remember it—imposing and grand—but drabber, as if some gilt had been rubbed off. “What’s through there?” I ask the pale young nun who leads me from the gatehouse, pointing at an archway. I remember the green, the sunlight beyond. “There? That’s just the kitchen yard,” she says. For a moment I allow myself to imagine that I am here to present myself to the abbess. I could, I realize. Our house, our flock: they’d make a small dowry, and now they’re mine to dispose of. I’m even still a virgin. But the prospect is laughable. I can no more deliver myself to the place where my sister is venerated than I can to an unfathomable God. The nun leads me to a chill shaded room with bare floors and a few chairs. Outside, the sky must have cleared, because light leaks through the leaded windows, forming shapes on the flagstones. “Will Christina see me?” A pulse under my right eye kicks. “My sister.” Something like hostility flickers in the nun’s bland, lashless eyes, then is gone. She nods, retreats on silent feet. When she reaches the door, she turns back, and her expression twists. “The nasty lapdog.” I jerk back, stung; I don’t know what I have done, what she can possibly mean, until I realize with a leap of gladness that she’s referring to Christina. Yes!, I want to call to her. I understand! “Sister,” I say. “Sister.” I rise to follow her, my heart knocking, but she has disappeared down the corridor. A second, older nun leads Christina in by the wrist. My sister towers above the woman but is docile in her grip. She doesn’t seem to want to run, even when she sees me, and, though her habit is crooked and untidy, she appears calm. The nun delivers her to me, then drops her wrist. “Christina,” I say. I bow and move to kiss her, because she’s a holy woman and because she is my sister. Christina turns wildly to the nun. “Please don’t leave me with her!” She’s afraid of me, I realize with a pang. The old woman comes back, drops onto a chair, and watches us warily. My sister is as thin as she ever was. A blue vein is visible on her forehead. She smiles at me—suddenly, mirthlessly—and the skin pleats around her wide mouth. In a burst of motion, she flings off her wimple and veil, casts them away from her, and looks back at the attending nun in triumph. She regards me and pulls a gray strand of hair, sucks the end. “We’re both gray now,” I say. Why am I here? I’d imagined a reunion, an understanding, a making of amends. I’d imagined a calm review of the wrongs we’d done each other. I’d imagined I might forgive her. But my sister is as alien to me as she ever was. “Gertrude died,” I tell her. “I came to tell you that. She died a widow, alone. She never did have a child.” Christina holds that dreadful wordless smile, but it wavers at the corners of her lips. “Oh, Christina,” I say. “Why could we never know each other? Why has your life been so hard?” My sister doesn’t answer me, and I have to break away from her gaze. The old nun has retrieved Christina’s veil from the floor and is smoothing it in her lap. I imagine that later, after I’ve gone, she will rearrange it on Christina’s head, and my sister will be still before her, as obedient as a child. Only when I stand to leave does Christina reach out to touch me. She holds my hand in her large knob-knuckled one, draws me close gently. “When I pray,” she breathes into my ear, “I am ravished by the spirit. I whirl like a hoop.” She releases me, and then spins, habit flaring in the light at her feet, and dashes from the room. Of the Second Death of Blessed Christina and of the Translation of Her Body

Two in the morning, June 24, 1224. The hour of Matins. Christina is on her knees in her quiet cell. Three miles away, I, too, am awake. The year has the same shape it has always had, though each season comes sooner and passes more swiftly: breeding, birthing, shearing. Selling and butchering. I keep just a small flock these days, and I can manage it alone. Only now, during shearing, does the work overwhelm me, but I manage this, too, by rising early, working in the dewy dark by lamplight. Even at rest, I can’t escape the aching labor. Behind my closed eyes, the blades swish through dense wool and the tufts fall away. My forearms throb, my hand remains curled from clenching the shears. Blisters sting in the curve of my thumb. My hair is thick with lanolin, my fingers waxy. All night I pluck endless burrs from the tangles as though I were plucking souls from Purgatory. Agnus Dei . Christ is a sheep, gazing up at me with His hooded eyes and pale lashes, His long face and solemn little mouth. I drag him close to my stool, pin him between my thighs. He bleats in protest, then bows his head and submits. Everything aches: back, arms, neck, heart. I am hunched now. I turn him roughly and draw the curved blade close to his flesh, lifting a thick swath of yellow wool. Underneath, the coat is clean and white, and his skin ripples in the lamplight. He squeals when I nick him, bucks. But I yank him by the thick wool at his neck. The bright spot of red spreads like wine on linen. I grip him tighter, dig my knees into his sides, and when he shifts again the flood of light moves through me. I have a vision of my own now: in her dark cell, Christina stands from her prayers and staggers to her bed, where she is, in the words of the chroniclers, held fast in the sickness of death: she lies stretched out after the manner of corpses, and passes to the immortal age of ages. In her expression, relief. One more cut, and I free the matted wool from the sheep’s back. Quiet whorls of joy spin in my heart."

It’s like a middle schooler. That’s fitting, since twenty years ago the three men who made it were friends, in San Diego, at Thurgood Marshall Middle School.

Over lunch recently at Margaux, in Greenwich Village, “Brigsby” ’s brain trust—Kyle Mooney, a co-writer and the star; Kevin Costello, the other co-writer; and Dave McCary, the director—finished one another’s sentences and did a lot of supportive nodding. They had similar beards, though each claimed to have grown his for personal reasons. The shaggy-haired Mooney, who plays exuberantly inept characters on “Saturday Night Live,” declared, “When summer comes, I like to let loose!” McCary, a ruminative man who directs many of Mooney’s pre-taped “S.N.L.” segments, said, “I’m just generally lazy.” Costello added, “And I just have a fat old face.” McCary said, “We actually got together today to talk about Kevin’s insecurities.”

In “Brigsby Bear,” Mooney plays a twentysomething man named James, who has grown up in a bunker and been reared on a retro TV show about a Teddy Ruxpin-like talking bear. One day, the police break in, and James finds out that his “parents” (Mark Hamill and Jane Adams) kidnapped him as a baby, and that Hamill’s character made “Brigsby Bear Adventures” for him alone. (He played Brigsby himself, wearing a fur suit and a roly-poly bear’s head.) Restored to his real family, James begins by embracing everything—“Want a beer?” “Yes, I would like one of that!”—a wide-eyed immigrant to modern life.

After the trio ordered sandwiches and glasses of rosé, Costello recalled that when he arrived in San Diego from Oklahoma, in seventh grade, McCary and Mooney were his guides. They introduced him to Limp Bizkit and surfer style. “They weren’t that cool, but they were funny and they didn’t give too much of a shit,” he said.

“I totally cared,” McCary said. “That I didn’t have access to the money to get the coolest clothes ate away at me.”

“I was the strongest guy in my class,” Mooney boasted, preposterously. “I kind of bullied these guys.” He swung his arms like Bluto.

“I knew from middle school that Kyle’s ability to create comedic discomfort was different,” McCary said. “Both Kevin and I had the fortunate situation that when Kyle was establishing himself I was his one filmmaker friend and Kevin was our one screenwriter friend. We just happened to supply the things that could help Kyle excel.”

Mooney said, “Our classmates from that era totally influence the stuff Dave and I have done.”

“It’s a special shorthand no one else but our classmates gets,” McCary said.

“Like Jim,” Mooney explained. “I’m just going to call him Jim S. Sweatpants all the time, constant erection, reading fantasy books, talking to himself.”

“That was hilarious,” Costello said, dryly.

In “Brigsby,” after James figures out the contours of the world via a lot of Google searches, he focusses on what matters most to him: making a film about Brigsby and pulling in his friends to help—just as Mooney did. Costello said, “The most interesting thing to us was never the kidnapping and abuse, never ‘Oh, how deep the evil of man,’ but instead: What if the only story you’d ever been told never had an ending? How badly would you want to finish it? Because that story would be your religion, your everything.”

McCary said that Mark Hamill’s character “is a fucked-up Jim Henson, teaching weird lessons about the world in a loving way.” He finished his chicken sandwich and added, “Kevin and I grew up in pretty intense Christian households. My dad was a Seventh-Day Adventist pastor, and from an early age I was put off by being force-fed a belief system. So I was really fiending for the darkest, sexiest stuff, the absolute slums of life.” He looked across the table, shyly. “I don’t imagine you guys would want to make those kinds of films, though.”

Costello frowned, and Mooney shook his head, saying, “I kind of really want to collaborate with some new people on the next one.” Everyone laughed. “The truth is,” Mooney continued, “I’ll silence myself from going dark even in conversations like this. I don’t want my mom to know that I jerk off, like, six times a day.”

McCary said, “The next movie will include a full twenty-minute take of you masturbating—the beginning, middle, and end of that experience.”

“I actually have that video!” Mooney cried.

As lunch wound down, the friends talked about having dinner together, and their disbelief that they had somehow raised four million dollars, secured actors such as Greg Kinnear and Claire Danes, and made a film. “I’m not a major name,” Mooney said, “so we certainly needed the other actors to sell the movie.”

“You’re a major name to us!” McCary said.

Mooney laughed. “And that’s why I like to talk to you guys!” ♦"

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/a-new-kind-of-adultery-novel,newyorker,A New Kind of Adultery Novel,[],"In 2015, The Dublin Review ran a goodbye-to-all-that essay by Sally Rooney, a young Irish writer, about her brief career as a university debater. A couple of years earlier, as a student at Trinity College, Dublin, Rooney had risen through the ranks of the European circuit to become the No. 1 debater on the Continent, but she wrote about her feats the way a recovering alcoholic might look back on a time of sotted carousing, at once proud of her exploits and appalled by the person she had been while having them. What Rooney loved about debating was entering a state of “flow,” that magical mental hum when disparate facts and ideas effortlessly assembled themselves in her mind and poured from her mouth as argument. Yet she was also disturbed by her talent for advocating morally dubious positions, like capitalism’s benefits for the poor, or “things oppressed people should do about their oppression.” She quit after winning the championship. “Maybe I stopped debating to see if I could still think of things to say when there weren’t any prizes,” she wrote.

She could. Rooney is now twenty-six and, after earning a master’s in American literature and publishing a few short stories, has just come out with her first novel, “ Conversations with Friends ” (Hogarth). There are prizes for fiction, it’s true, but writing it is a private performance: you judge yourself first on your own stage, by your own rules. Rooney turns out to be as intelligent and agile a novelist as she apparently was a debater, and for many of the same reasons. As its title promises, Rooney’s book glitters with talk, much of it between Frances, the novel’s narrator, and Bobbi, her best friend, two Trinity students supremely gifted in the collegiate sport of competitive banter. Observations, theories, and quips about the world fly between the friends like so many shuttlecocks in a conversation that never ends, because conversations, in our world of screens, don’t have to. They just change format, so that a discussion begun in person continues through texts or e-mails or, as in the following dialogue, instant messages:

Bobbi: if you look at love as something other than an interpersonal phenomenon Bobbi: and try to understand it as a social value system Bobbi: it’s both antithetical to capitalism, in that it challenges the axiom of selfishness Bobbi: which dictates the whole logic of inequality Bobbi: and yet also it’s subservient and facilitatory Bobbi: i.e. mothers selflessly raising children without any profit motive Bobbi: which seems to contradict the demands of the market at one level Bobbi: and yet actually just functions to provide workers for free me: yes me: capitalism harnesses “love” for profit me: love is the discursive practice and unpaid labour is the effect me: but I mean, I get that, I’m anti love as such Bobbi: that’s vapid frances Bobbi: you have to do more than say you’re anti things.

This exchange, so rigorously serious as to be comic, calls to mind another pair of brilliant Dublin students, Cranly and Stephen Dedalus, who stroll around in “ A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man ,” arguing over the Eucharist and apostasy. Cranly and Dedalus came of age in an Ireland riven by religious strife, Bobbi and Frances in an Ireland gutted by the 2008 financial collapse. Capitalism is to Rooney’s young women what Catholicism was to Joyce’s young men, a rotten national faith to contend with, though how exactly to resist capitalism, when it has sunk its teeth so deep into the human condition, remains an open question. To be “anti love,” as Frances declares herself, is as ideologically satisfying as it is emotionally untenable, a weak position that Bobbi pounces on with startling pitilessness.

Frances’s disavowal of love strikes a poignant note, too, for Bobbi was her girlfriend before she became her friend. At the convent high school where they met, Bobbi was a cigarette-smoking contrarian with a pierced nose who freaked out her square classmates and pissed off her teachers. (Her coup de grâce was scrawling “fuck the patriarchy” next to a wall-mounted crucifix.) Frances remembers how, when she was seventeen, Bobbi approached her at a school dance, “radiantly attractive” as she swigged vodka from a bottle of Coke, to ask if Frances liked girls: “It was very easy to act unfazed around her. I just said: sure.”

The relationship lasted for more than a year, and though Frances doesn’t explain why it ended, the friends’ intimacy still has the all-absorbing intensity of romance, as well as its thorny imbalances of power and temperament. Bobbi is the clear star of the pair, beautiful and puckishly charismatic, with a suffer-no-fools bravado that, as Frances says, “could be abrasive and unrestrained in a way that made people uncomfortable, while I tended to be encouragingly polite. Mothers always liked me a lot, for example.” So do men. At the open-mike nights around Dublin where the friends perform spoken-word poetry together, Bobbi ignores any guy who tries to chat them up, leaving him to Frances. “I enjoyed playing this kind of character, the smiling girl,” Frances confesses, but Bobbi considers such agreeableness to be pandering. “Bobbi told me she thought I didn’t have ‘a real personality,’ but she said she meant it as a compliment. Mostly I agreed with her assessment.”

The novel opens at one of these poetry nights, in early summer, where Frances and Bobbi meet Melissa, an established writer and photographer in her thirties. They are familiar with her work; Melissa, impressed with what she has just seen of theirs, invites them back to her house for a nightcap. As Bobbi entertains their host with clever conversation, Frances takes stock of her large, comfortable home, casing it like a thief. Melissa has money, Frances concludes. She also has a husband: Nick, an actor, whom Frances finds “handsome in the most generic way”— a strong, silent hunk with a soft mouth and good cheekbones who looks great without a shirt on, as she discovers later, clicking through images of him on Google. The pictures are old, from cancelled soaps and second-rate films; Nick’s career has never quite taken off. It seems impossible to imagine that he could be the equal of cerebral, impressive Melissa.

There’s an aura of seduction to the boozy night with Melissa. Soon after, she e-mails Frances and Bobbi to suggest profiling them as literary up-and-comers for a local magazine. Flattered, they accept, and as they spend more time with Melissa and Nick, eating dinner at their house, socializing at book launches, a fraught dynamic begins to take shape. Though Frances is the writer—it is her work that the friends perform—Melissa clearly prefers Bobbi, with whom she establishes a rapport of cozy, mutual infatuation. Frances, excluded and hurt, finds herself thrown together with Nick, the other neglected partner in this odd four-person dance. He’s far sharper and subtler than his looks suggest, with a quiet, tentative quality she finds surprising in so masculine a man. “He was the first person I had met since Bobbi who made me enjoy conversation, in the same irrational and sensuous way I enjoyed coffee or loud music,” Frances thinks, though the tone that she and Nick take with each other is so relentlessly sardonic that neither is sure if the flirtation is serious. It is. At Melissa’s birthday party, they kiss. Frances flees in confused shame, but when she returns, a few days later, it is to his bed. “I might never be able to speak again after this,” she thinks, in stunned ecstasy, as he begins to touch her—a frightening thought for someone so used to protecting herself with language, and a freeing one, too. In spite of herself, Frances has stumbled straight into a love story."

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/novelizing-greek-myth,newyorker,Novelizing Greek Myth,[],"Nobody liked to fiddle with Greek myths more than the Greeks did. Take, for example, one of the best-known tales from the vast web of stories that circulated about the Trojan War: Agamemnon, the victorious Greek general, comes home to his kingdom after ten years only to be murdered by his queen, Clytemnestra, and her lover, Aegisthus—a crime later avenged by the dead king’s children. In Homer’s Odyssey, composed around 750 B.C., the main villain is Aegisthus, a cad who seduces the weak-willed Clytemnestra and then ambushes the recently returned king and his retainers at a feast, slaughtering them in a grotesque parody of a real battle, the bodies lying among the scattered crockery. (Aegisthus may have had his reasons: according to some, his two brothers were murdered by Agamemnon’s father and served up to their own father at a feast, baked in a pie.) Three centuries later, Clytemnestra took center stage—literally. In the first part of the Oresteia (458 B.C.), a trilogy of tragedies by Aeschylus, the queen fulsomely welcomes her husband home from Troy; then she lures him into a bathtub and hacks him and his Trojan concubine to death. Unlike Homer, Aeschylus gave Clytemnestra a powerful motivation for her treachery. At the beginning of the play, the chorus recalls how, at the outset of the Trojan War, Agamemnon sacrificed his and Clytemnestra’s daughter Iphigenia, in order to propitiate an angry god and win fair winds for his fleet to sail to Troy. The Oresteia established a more or less canonical version of the events that rippled outward from these retributive homicides. In the second play of the trilogy, the couple’s two surviving children, Orestes and Electra, are reunited as adults after a long separation and then scheme to murder their mother and her lover. (In a scene that came to embarrass later dramatists, Electra is persuaded that her brother has returned after she discovers a footprint and a lock of hair at their father’s tomb—which, she concludes, must belong to her long-lost brother because the footprint is the same size as hers and the hair is similar.) The third play features Western literature’s first courtroom drama: Orestes, pursued by the vengeful Furies for the murder of Clytemnestra, is put on trial for matricide but is eventually acquitted—in part because his defense lawyer, who happens to be the god Apollo, argues that matricide isn’t such a big deal since, after all, the man is the only “true parent,” and the woman merely “nurses the seed.” No wonder scholarly studies of this work have such titles as “The Dynamics of Misogyny.” Over the next half-century, playwrights teased out the implications of the story’s irresistibly schematic pairings and oppositions: between justice and vengeance, male and female, parents and children, free will and fate, the claims of family feeling and the exigencies of state policy. Sophocles wrote an “Electra” whose heroine is a counterpart to his Antigone—a fierce virgin who defies convention in her obsessive quest to avenge family wrongs. As time passed, a note of irreverence crept in: in Euripides’ “Electra,” Aeschylus’ grim moralizing and Sophocles’ agonized psychologizing have been edged aside by an almost postmodern willingness to poke fun at literary models. In this version, Electra refuses to believe that the lock of hair discovered at her father’s tomb belongs to Orestes since, as she exasperatedly points out, siblings don’t necessarily have identical hair. In the same playwright’s “Orestes,” produced in 408 B.C., shortly before he died, the siblings, awaiting execution after their trial for matricide, hatch a plan that, for sheer ad-hoc nuttiness, would give the villains in “Fargo” a run for their money. Enraged by their dilemma, they plot to murder Helen of Troy (Clytemnestra’s sister), hold her innocent daughter hostage (they nab her after she goes to offer a lock of hair at a tomb), and torch the royal palace. “Set the parapets ablaze!” Orestes cries at the play’s climax, and it’s hard not to feel that that’s pretty much what the play is doing to the mythic tradition. Many scholars have seen in these fantastical riffs on the ancient tale a sign that the genre of tragedy had exhausted itself. The Princeton classicist Froma I. Zeitlin suggests that, by the time Euripides wrote “Orestes,” he had diverged so extravagantly from myth (“the relatively closed and predetermined form”) that he ended up straying into a genre that hadn’t been invented yet: what we call fiction (“the mode of new possibilities marked by a receptivity to experimentation and change”). And yet, although authors working in a number of genres have revisited the plots and characters of Greek tragedy—from Ovid’s playful verse epic Metamorphoses, in the first century A.D., to “Mourning Becomes Electra,” Eugene O’Neill’s 1931 updating of the Oresteia narrative to the Civil War era—the genre has tended to resist novelistic adaptation. Epic, by contrast, has proved a rich source of temptation for novelists: recent attempts include works as diverse as David Malouf’s “Ransom,” which finds space in a climactic scene from the Iliad to explore themes of mortality, forgiveness, and, indeed, novelistic originality (in it, the Trojan king, Priam, wonders whether he can break out of his usual role and think of something new to do); Margaret Atwood’s “The Penelopiad,” a feminist retelling of the Odyssey from the point of view of Odysseus’ queen and her twelve maids; and Madeline Miller’s “The Song of Achilles,” a breathless reimagining of the relationship between the Iliad’s Achilles and his companion, Patroclus. But whereas the weave of epic is loose, leaving spaces for expansion and adaptation, the tragedies—many of which, we should remember, were themselves adaptations of episodes from epic—are highly compressed, almost hermetic. The contemporary mainstream novel, which is realistic in technique and concerned, more often than not, with the lives and psychologies of ordinary people, doesn’t seem an ideal vessel for tragedy, with its stiffly operatic formal conventions, its grandiose royal protagonists, and its plots inflected by the supernatural. And, as “ House of Names ” (Scribner), a new novel by the Irish writer Colm Tóibín, suggests, the Oresteia narrative in particular—precisely because it has already been endlessly reimagined, reworked, expanded, and adapted—poses special problems for even the most inventive and subtle writers.

Like his ancient predecessors, Tóibín wants both to enhance and to interrogate a much told tale. A nice touch is that, in “House of Names,” Clytemnestra and Electra each get to tell their own stories: chapters devoted to their first-person narratives of the familiar events alternate with sections about Orestes’ adventures. The Orestes story is related in the third person, a device that deprives the eponymous hero of Aeschylus’ trilogy of his own voice—the author’s sly riposte, perhaps, to the fact that in so many Greek myths women’s concerns, like their bodies, are subordinated to those of men. Still, at the beginning of the novel, events hew so closely to the Greek originals that you may wonder why the author has bothered to retell this old tale at all. The first section consists of Clytemnestra’s bitter account of the events leading up to Iphigenia’s sacrifice, lingering on how Agamemnon tricked her into bringing their daughter to the port of Aulis, where the Greek fleet had gathered, on the pretext that she was to be married to Achilles. This version of the story is lifted more or less intact from one of Euripides’ final plays, “Iphigenia in Aulis.” But before long a number of additions, omissions, and tweaks to the Greek versions make it clear that Tóibín is just as comfortable playing around with the traditional narrative as Euripides was. In “Iphigenia at Aulis,” Clytemnestra begs Agamemnon to stop the sacrifice, an act that, she knows, will turn her into a murderess. But what, you always wondered, went on between the husband and wife just after the horrific ritual was performed? Tóibín ingeniously fills in the gap. His Clytemnestra doesn’t witness her daughter’s sacrifice, because Agamemnon has his wife thrown into a hole in the ground for a few days, just to let her know who’s in charge—and to prevent her from using her dark female magic to foil his plans. When she emerges, she’s feral, starving, covered in her own waste. In the Oresteia, after Clytemnestra has slaughtered her husband and his concubine, she exults over the bodies in a speech notorious for its unhinged grisliness (among other things, she compares the blood in which she’s drenched to a nourishing rain). Tóibín vividly enhances our sense of what unhinged her. Tóibín has also mastered Euripides’ tart literary allusiveness. Like the Greek playwright, he includes a rather sour recognition scene in his story: “Can you tell them that I . . . have come back?” “They won’t believe me,” she said. “Can you cut a lock of my hair and show it to my mother?” he asked. “Your hair has changed,” she said, “You have changed. I didn’t recognize you.” You imagine that, when Euripides’ audience first saw “Electra” and got to the part where the heroine irritably observes that siblings don’t have identical hair, people chuckled—they recognized the (perhaps fond) jab at the archaic credulity of Aeschylus’ recognition scene. But in his riff on the scene Tóibín out-Euripideses Euripides. Here the youth who’s come home after a long absence and has to prove his identity to his sister isn’t Orestes but a made-up character called Leander, Orestes’ best friend and sometime lover. (The two men, we learn, met as children, when they were imprisoned on Aegisthus’ orders, soon after Agamemnon’s murder, in a kind of Mycenaean reform school. This episode, as well as the boys’ subsequent adventures after they escape, is an invention that satisfyingly fills in another awkward gap—what Orestes was up to between the sacrifice of his sister and his reappearance as a young adult bent on vengeance.) Tóibín’s simultaneous allusion to and sidestepping of the older myths, his lithe entwining of mimicry and innovation, give his novel a very Euripidean feel. But Tóibín is interested in more than mere literary gamesmanship. In an article for the Guardian earlier this year, he described why he finds the old myth still relevant. The sectarian violence in Ireland during his youth, he wrote, seemed to him a perfect parallel to the retributive horrors described by Aeschylus in the Oresteia: “For any student of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, no event was isolated. Each murder or set of murders seemed to have been inspired by a previous one, each atrocity appeared to be in retaliation for something that had occurred the week before.” Another thing that he wanted to explore, he went on, was a paradox all too familiar from Ireland’s and, indeed, the world’s troubles: how otherwise ordinary people become agents of atrocity. He cited Asma al-Assad, the British-born wife of Syria’s President, as an example, and something of her, perhaps, finds its way into Tóibín’s portrayal of Clytemnestra. Here she is both a mother fretting about her children—she’s much more sympathetic to Orestes and Electra than her character is in the Greek plays—and a queen who doesn’t ask too many questions when it turns out that Aegisthus is keeping the rebellious nobles in line by holding their young sons and grandsons hostage."

O.K., granted, “Come from Away” just copped a Tony—but what about all the Canadian shows that have bombed on Broadway since “Plaid & Flannel,” in 1913? Who remembers “A Mountie and His Sister,” the 1937 no-singing, no-dancing, all-whistling flop? A revival of the 1901 Broadway smash “Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines” has remained in previews since 1935, while the director and producers attempt to agree on whether the featured player is a horse in the Marines or a marine playing a horse.

That hunky young Canadian Prime Minister makes Trump look like a used-car salesman, no argument, but didn’t an earlier Canadian P.M. give the visiting H.M. Queen Elizabeth II a hotfoot at a state dinner? And why did his predecessor declare war on the French Foreign Legion? And whatever happened to the showgirl that his predecessor kept stashed in a carrel in the back of the Parliament-building library?

Canadian society, with its free universal health care, strict gun control, and welcome-all-immigrants policy, seems so decent. But you never hear about the Red Light Gangs, the late-night scofflaws who swarm deserted city streets, waiting for stoplights to flash “ DON’T WALK ”—then step off the curb, deliberately walking! The Mad Sleep-Disturber, who sets off car alarms all over metropolitan Hamilton, Ontario, well after midnight, has never been caught. And Russian-made popguns with telescopic sights now glut the country’s shooting galleries. Visiting Canada? Memorize the local cop-hotline number—or take your chances.

Canadian comics have ruled American entertainment for years. Good for them. But who’s going to furnish laughs for those they leave behind? A recent report by a blue-ribbon Royal Commission, Whither Our Canadian Drollery, recommends intercepting Canadian comics bound for Los Angeles and New York at the border and examining their brains, in the hope of uncovering a “humor gene” that can be sold to the Americans so they can start growing their own damn jokesters.

Sergeant Preston of the Yukon (real name: Art Mung) was not a sergeant in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and never set foot in the Yukon; he purchased a used Mountie outfit at an Army-Navy-R.C.M.P. store and strolled around his home town of Etobicoke, Ontario, claiming to be searching for his lost husky. Moral: beware the devious, the slippery, the cunning Canadian.

It was Dr. Frederick Banting, a Canadian, who gave the world insulin. But that’s about it. A Bulgarian invented the aerial bomb; a Spaniard, the autogiro; the Chinese, both gunpowder and toilet paper. These and myriad other innovations may just as well have been born in Canada, but something—apathy? low I.Q.s? that all-too-familiar whine “Hey, I’m watching ‘Hockey Night,’ let somebody else do it”?—insures that such blessings never get stamped “Made in Canada.”

Self-effacement is as Canadian as not going out on Saturday nights. How, then, do you explain Bragging Day, the second Thursday of June? Everybody jots down something nice about his or her family on a scrap of paper and hands it to a next-door neighbor. Is this a charming tradition, drawing folks together, or a sly expression of secret rampant egomania? Canadians, like all self-effacing secret egomaniacs, would, if so charged, profess shock.

Canadians bend over backward to be fair, correct? A myth, based on a blunder. Canada’s dangerously overblown reputation for fair play can be traced back to Flanders, 1914, after the Second Battle of Chumps. A scout for the 35th Manitoba Light Fusiliers found the German battle plan while ransacking the pockets of an Oberleutnant’s discarded greatcoat. Clearly mislaid and definitely the property of the German Army, the battle plan was returned to the enemy line by carrier pigeon, along with an explanatory note. The subsequent Third Battle of Chumps was a German rout, celebrated every November 12th in Canada as a smashing triumph of fair play.

Canadians are so naturally polite! American visitors go all gaga over the civility, the kindness, the seemingly automatic niceness of the place. Even Canadian prison guards are courteous to inmates. And inmates to guards: “I fully understand, officer. I’ll pipe down after lights-out and ask my cellmates to do the same!” Well, wait till your back is turned: “If those Yanks are so smart, how come Canada got the beautiful side of Niagara Falls?”; “Stupid bastards call a chesterfield a ‘sofa’ and think they’re better than us!”; “Americans are all fat, spoiled blowhards with too much money and not enough maple syrup!”

It’s ugly. And it’s as Canadian as poutine at a bonspiel. ♦"

I had been trying to find field agents willing to describe what life was like at the agency in the Trump era. This agent agreed to talk. Over the past four months, we have texted often and spoken on the phone several times. Some of our discussions have been about the specifics of new federal policies aimed at dramatically increasing the number of deportations. At other times, we’ve talked more broadly about how the culture at ICE has shifted. In April, the agent texted me a screen shot of a page from the minutes of a recent meeting, during which a superior had said that it was “the most exciting time to be part of ICE ” in the agency’s history. The photo was sent without commentary—the agent just wanted someone on the outside to see it.

The agent, who has worked in federal immigration enforcement since the Clinton Administration, has been unsettled by the new order at ICE . During the campaign, many rank-and-file agents publicly cheered Trump’s pledge to deport more immigrants, and, since Inauguration Day, the Administration has explicitly encouraged them to pursue the undocumented as aggressively as possible. “We’re going to get sued,” the agent told me at one point. “You have guys who are doing whatever they want in the field, going after whoever they want.” At first, the agent spoke to me on the condition that I not publish anything about our conversations. But that has changed. Increasingly angry about the direction in which ICE is moving, the agent agreed last week to let me publish some of the details of our talks, as long as I didn’t include identifying information.

“We used to look at things through the totality of the circumstances when it came to a removal order—that’s out the window,” the agent told me the other day. “I don’t know that there’s that appreciation of the entire realm of what we’re doing. It’s not just the person we’re removing. It’s their entire family. People say, ‘Well, they put themselves in this position because they came illegally.’ I totally understand that. But you have to remember that our job is not to judge. The problem is that now there are lots of people who feel free to feel contempt.”

Like many ICE employees, the agent was a critic of President Barack Obama, whose push to standardize enforcement practice and micromanage agents, particularly during his second term, was a source of frustration at the agency. Yet with Obama gone, and the era of micromanagement over, the agent sees long-standing standards being discarded and basic protocols questioned. “I have officers who are more likely now to push back,” the agent said. “I’d never have someone say, ‘Why do I have to call an interpreter? Why don’t they speak English?’ Now I get it frequently. I get this from people who are younger. That’s one group. And I also get it from people who are ethnocentric: ‘Our way is the right way—I shouldn’t have to speak in your language. This is America.’ ” It all adds up, the agent said, “to contempt that I’ve never seen so rampant towards the aliens.”

The agent’s decision to allow me to write about our conversations came after learning that ICE was making a push, beginning this week, to arrest young undocumented immigrants who were part of a large wave of unaccompanied minors who crossed the border in recent years and who, until now, had been allowed to live in the U.S. Rather than detaining these young people, the government had placed them in the care of families around the country. Most of them are trying to lead new lives as American transplants, going to school and working. ICE now plans to pursue those who have turned eighteen since crossing the border, and who, as a result, qualify for detention as legal adults. “I don’t see the point in it,” the agent said. “The plan is to take them back into custody, and then figure it out. I don’t understand it. We’re doing it because we can, and it bothers the hell out of me.”

The agent went on, “The whole idea is targeting kids. I know that technically they meet the legal definition of being adults. Fine. But if they were my kids travelling in a foreign country, I wouldn’t be O.K. with this. We’re not doing what we tell people we do. If you look next month, or at the end of this month, at the people in custody, it’s people who’ve been here for years. They’re supposed to be in high school.”

The agent was especially concerned about a new policy that allows ICE to investigate cases of immigrants who may have paid smugglers to bring their children or relatives into the country. ICE considers these family members guilty of placing children “directly in harm’s way,” as one spokeswoman recently put it, and the agency will hold them “accountable for their role in these conspiracies.” According to ICE , these measures will help combat “a constant humanitarian threat,” but the agent said that rationale was just a pretext to increase arrests and eventually deport more people. “We seem to be targeting the most vulnerable people, not the worst.” The agent also believes that the policy will make it harder for the government to handle unaccompanied children who show up at the border. “You’re going to have kids stuck in detention because parents are too scared of being prosecuted to want to pick them up!” the agent said.

U.S. immigration courts are facing a backlog of half a million cases, with only a limited number of judges available to hear them and issue rulings. “We still have to make decisions based on a responsible use of the government’s resources—you can’t lock everybody up,” the agent said. “We’re putting more people into that overburdened system just because we can. There’s just this school of thought that, well, we can do what we want.”

Before this year, the agent had never spoken to the media. “I have a couple of colleagues that I can kind of talk to, but not many,” the agent said. “This has been a difficult year for many of us.” These people, not just at ICE but also at other federal agencies tasked with enforcing the nation’s immigration laws, are “trying to figure out how to minimize the damage.” It isn’t clear what, exactly, they can do under the circumstances. “Immigration is a pendulum—it swings to the left sometimes, or it swings to the right,” the agent told me last week. “But there was a normal range. Now people are bringing their own opinions into work.” In the agent’s view, ICE is a changed agency.

“I like predictability,” the agent said. “I like being able to go into work and have faith in my senior managers and the Administration, and to know that, regardless of their political views, at the end of the day they’re going to do something that’s appropriate. I don’t feel that way anymore.”"
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/the-beatrice-inns-over-the-top-delicacies,newyorker,The Beatrice Inn’s Over-the-Top Delicacies,[],"If the very idea of a twelve-hundred-dollar steak offends you, and you find yourself at the Beatrice Inn, try not to listen as the waiter spins a fantastical tale about an enormous swath of beef that’s been wrapped in cloth, doused in French single malt, and aged for up to a hundred and sixty days. At “the Bea”—as this spot became affectionately known in its aughts incarnation as a night club for the Sevigny-era creative class—it’s the pièce de résistance of a menu dreamed up by the chef and owner, Angie Mar. When the waiter gets to the kicker—a bone-in tomahawk of this rarified meat comes to you at fourteen dollars an ounce, and the chef is cutting it at between fifty and seventy-five ounces—the mind reels as you do the math and try to look anywhere but into the waiter’s practiced, polite gaze.

Luckily, relatively, the menu is full of delicious, over-the-top bargains. The richness of fried dates stuffed with boar meat, for only twelve dollars, is cut nicely with a homemade grainy mustard. A plum tart, billed as savory, is more like an excellent dessert; grilled hunks of sourdough in a well-seasoned black-kale salad taste as if they were drenched in bone marrow—so, oddly, does a side of pea shoots topped with a fried duck egg. The dry-aged burger, high on flavor, rivals Minetta Tavern’s famous one. Duck flambé arrives on an actual silver platter, to be set afire before your eyes, yielding a plethora of delicately smoky, unusually tender, crispy-skinned duck parts. At a hundred and eight dollars, it easily feeds four. The other steak, a sixty-day-dry-aged côte de boeuf, is perfectly presentable, with roasted garlic and blackberries, but it makes you wonder what you’re missing. The decadence turns downright oppressive in a suet-crusted potpie of whole duck leg, the size of a casserole, topped with a hot-dog-length slab of foie gras.

Here’s the thing: Angie Mar is a badass. She bought this restaurant from Graydon Carter last year, and has turned it into a buzzy foodie destination simply by exalting her personal love of meat. So who’s buying the tomahawks? On a recent evening, none were spotted in the low-ceilinged, dark-wood-panelled room, packed with a mix of older wealthy patrons and lovely young strivers. By the end of the meal, you are barely fazed when the server describes the round of cheese that is made only two months of the year, which could be yours for fifty-two dollars, or the bone-marrow crème brûlée—served in a femur. A fried apple pie with foie-gras ice cream, just on a plate, seems like the prudent thing to do. It must be eaten in tiny bites—any bigger, and you might explode. (Entrées $32-$135 and up.) ♦"

Stephen Greenblatt’s essay on his Jewish family, his experiences with anti-Semitism at Yale, and Shakespeare’s character Shylock, in “The Merchant of Venice,” overlooks the way that Shylock’s language limits his participation in Venetian society (“ If You Prick Us ,” July 10th & 17th). Shylock, unlike nearly every other character in the play, is unable to employ figurative language, and the metaphors he attempts are few and simple. His speech is literal, low, and often unattractive, and although these qualities make him more fully present to modern audiences, they render him more alien to the society that surrounded him. Even Shylock’s “Hath not a Jew eyes” speech—powerful, compelling, and full of humanity and raw emotion—is still completely literal, devoid of figurative language. Shakespeare supplies us with no scene in which Shylock speaks in normal and sympathetic tones, prays in a synagogue, invites a friend to supper, or cracks a joke that is not designed to hurt someone. All society, not just Christian society, is painful to him. No wonder Shylock does not appear in Act V. As Greenblatt says, in its formal design the play steadfastly remains a comedy.

When my father, Gerald Berlin, the son of Jewish immigrants, applied to Yale Law School, he presented a letter of recommendation from one of his professors at the University of Virginia. It read, “Gerald is a Jew, but he is not one of these New York Jews. He is from Virginia. And that makes all the difference.” At U.Va., my father was recruited by some of the “gentlemen” he met playing touch football to join Kirby Court, a club that had not previously admitted Jewish members. Apparently, they were fooled by his Southern accent and charm, and didn’t realize that he was Jewish. My father went on to an illustrious career, which included an appointment as the Massachusetts assistant attorney general for civil rights. But he always maintained a healthy skepticism of institutions that thrived on the insularity that Greenblatt describes.

Greenblatt says that “what Shakespeare bequeathed to us offers the possibility of an escape from the mental ghettos most of us inhabit.” One mental ghetto is the belief that great literature is morally good for us, a premise that Greenblatt seems to accept. In “The Merchant of Venice,” the attitude toward Shylock is similar to that of people who find Israel’s claims to victimhood hypocritical in the light of its ongoing treatment of Palestinians. Perhaps it was ludicrous to an Elizabethan audience that a man who was willing to kill another man by holding him to a financial contract portrayed himself as a victim. It seems more plausible that Shakespeare shared the centuries-long prejudice against Jews than that he got carried away by his humanity and thus rendered his work, in Greenblatt’s words, an “uncomfortable” mix of high-mindedness and anti-Semitic attitudes.

Greenblatt, in describing the universality of “our species’ cultural birthright,” and the “mixed blessings” of its contradictions, uses a derogatory term for the Saami, the indigenous people of Scandinavia: Laplander. We are not Laplanders, and we consider the word a racial slur. In our native land, we have been treated the way North America’s indigenous people have been treated—Saami were once even displayed in a human zoo in Germany. The irony of making a point about commonality while denigrating a particular group is disappointing.

http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-surprising-things-statistics-tell-us-about-fiction,newyorker,The Surprising Things Statistics Tell Us About Fiction,[],"In high school, writing term papers on the family PC, I’d often turn to Microsoft Word’s “readability statistics” feature to make sure I sounded smart enough. With a few clicks, Word assigned my papers a Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level: a number from one to twelve indicating how many years of education the average reader would need to have completed in order to decipher my language. I had no idea how Word made this calculation, but I noticed that it rewarded prolix sentences with a higher “grade.” So that’s what I wrote. I put my every word choice under close scrutiny. Soon my paragraphs buckled under the weight of clauses and polysyllables, but I, a ninth grader, was generating prose that only twelfth graders could read—which made me pretty hot shit, my thinking went.

Those Flesch-Kincaid trials came back to me as I read “ Nabokov’s Favorite Word Is Mauve: What the Numbers Reveal About the Classics, Bestsellers, and Our Own Writing ,” by Ben Blatt, which looks at the canon as a statistical gold mine to be dredged for patterns, variances, and singularities. In “literary experiments” on diction, punctuation, cliffhangers, clichés, and other aspects of style and usage, Blatt uses data to probe the body of conventional wisdom that surrounds creative writing. What if those who allegedly loathe adverbs are actually completely, totally addicted to them? What if it’s quite O.K. to use intensifiers very often, because Jane Austen is rather fond of them? What if I like exclamation points! Blatt’s jacket bio cites “his fun approach to data journalism”—a bit of prolepsis, maybe, aimed at those of us who’d sooner watch paint dry than look at anything quantitatively—and his book is laden with charts, lists, and tables printed in a gentle purple. The lessons here are valuable because of their workmanlike cast, not in spite of it. Put aside the “fun approach” and “Mauve” makes some enticingly heretical observations: that every great writer is a technician, every novel a mere agglomeration of prose effects.

The book is built on agreeable miscellany, and parts of it are willfully trivial. On the face of it, there’s not much to be gleaned from the fact that James Joyce uses 1,105 exclamation points per hundred thousand words, or that J. R. R. Tolkien leans too often on “suddenly,” that most accursed of adverbs. Blatt’s findings are more absorbing when he ditches the bean-counter approach. American writers of Harry Potter fan fiction are actually more liable to use “brilliant” than their British counterparts, who employ the word with native agility. And, in a study of erotica written by New Yorkers, Blatt notes a preponderance of the following words: subway, popsicle, senator, butthole, museum, landlord, thrusted, Jacuzzi, sin, and shrugs. Most of these choices are intuitive, even laudable—but what explains those last three? I grasp that a New Yorker might lust for a senator with a popsicle in his butthole; a shrugging sinner in a hot tub doesn’t quite rate.

Blatt’s research on diction and gender is especially revelatory. Looking at a broad swath of twentieth-century lit, he tallies the verbs most often used to describe one gender over another. The results find rich deposits of sexism running through the language. Male characters are most likely to mutter, grin, shout, chuckle, and kill; women are doomed to shiver, weep, murmur, scream, and marry. Male authors are far likelier to write “she interrupted” than “he interrupted.” A grim typology begins to emerge. Men are raffish, jolly, murderous sorts, while women are delicate and meek, except when they deign to interrupt men, as they often do. There’s some sexual self-loathing across the board, too: when writers assign verbs to someone of the opposite gender, they most often reach for “kiss,” “exclaim,” “answer,” “love,” and “smile”; characters of the same gender “hear,” “wonder,” “lay,” “hate,” and “run.”

The high point of the book is Blatt’s effort “to test whether something like a literary fingerprint exists for famous writers.” It does, he finds­—across their oeuvres, “authors do end up writing in a way that is both unique and consistent, just like an actual fingerprint is distinct and unchanging.” Even the way that writers deploy simple pairs of words—“and” and “the,” “these” and “then,” “what” and “but”—is often enough to identify them. The numbers bear out a romantic idea: that a writer is always ineluctably herself. Soon, Blatt zeroes in on writers’ “favorite” words—hence his title, indicating Nabokov’s predilection for “mauve.” The words must be used in half an author’s books, at least once per hundred thousand words; they can’t be proper nouns. His discoveries are startlingly apt. Almost without fail, the words evoke their authors’ affinities and manias. John Cheever favors “venereal”—a perfect encapsulation of his urbane midcentury erotics, tinged with morality. Isaac Asimov prefers “terminus,” a word ensconced in a swooping, stately futurism; Woolf has her “mantelpiece,” Wharton her “compunction.” (Melville’s “sperm” is somewhat misleading, perhaps, when separated from his whales.)

Cumulatively, these facts and figures make “Mauve” an effective craft book. By reminding us that literature is just strings of words and punctuation, Blatt has taken the whiff of the godhead out of it. Writers like to emphasize the psychology in their work, their strenuous labor toward depth and verisimilitude; they’re less inclined to talk about how few decent synonyms exist for “good.” The stats speak a cold truth: there are dozens of prosaic choices behind every artful sentence. Dwelling on this can inoculate writers against the preciousness of the workshop. “Mauve” has no truck with showing instead of telling, no druthers about sense of place or voice. Even in great books, it says, one word follows another, all of them slaves to grammar, sequence, and probability.

Then again, as the figures pile up, claustrophobia sets in. I caught myself wishing I worked in a less quantifiable medium. Ceramicists, for instance, never seem to answer to the Blatts of the world. Like the Flesch-Kincaid formula, which Blatt mentions in a passage about the verbal simplicity of children’s literature, “Mauve” and its number-crunching can feel joyless—the equivalent of an architecture critic who counts the number of bricks in a façade. At his weakest, Blatt sounds like a tour guide over a loudspeaker. “It’s by noting the role of each word and punctuation mark,” he writes, “that the greats are able to hone their writing”—an observation that at once understates the act of revision and ignores the ecstatic, almost compulsive sloppiness that makes some writers great.

“The written word and the world of numbers should not be kept apart,” Blatt writes, and I think he’s right; what’s frustrating is that no one has yet figured out how they might productively collaborate. Like last year’s “ The Bestseller Code ,” which described an algorithm that predicted the plots of popular novels, “Mauve” wagers that the “digital humanities,” as they’ve uneasily come to be known, can instruct audiences outside of the academy. The book’s finest moments prove that they can—but to what end? Blatt argues that his work is “not an attempt to ‘engineer’ art as much as a way to understand it”: “If you were a band in the 1960s you would want to know how the Beatles were recording their songs.” Maybe so, but is that really what this book professes to teach? Knowing the rate at which Ringo hits his snare drum does not a Beatle make.

Reading “Mauve,” I began to imagine two duelling schools of authorship, both motivated by statistics. In one, writers would cultivate their tics, inhabiting themselves so thoroughly that to encounter them on the page would be like finding their footprints in wet cement. In the other, writers would aspire to defy the data, styling their prose with such intricate, chameleonic grace that no statistician could betray their identity. A few decades ago, the advent of the word processor made it easier than ever to revise on the fly; it also made it easy to dwell on one sentence ad infinitum, gilding the lily where once one would’ve advanced to the next thought. The glut of data is another mixed blessing—past a certain point, writers would do better in a state of blissful ignorance. Otherwise, they might end up with work like my ninth-grade term papers, mannered and overwrought.

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level on this piece, by the way, is a mere 10.3."
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/24/how-trump-is-transforming-rural-america,newyorker,How Trump Is Transforming Rural America,[],"When Karen Kulp was a child, she believed that the United States of America as she knew it was going to end on June 6, 1966. Her parents were from the South, and they had migrated to Colorado, where Kulp’s father was involved in mining operations and various entrepreneurial activities. In terms of ideology, her parents had started with the John Birch Society, and then they became more radical, until they thought that an invasion was likely to take place on 6/6/66, because it resembled the number of the Beast. “We thought we were going to have a world war, there would be Communists coming, we’d have to kill somebody for a loaf of bread,” Kulp said recently. She was thirteen when doomsday came. The family was living in Del Norte, Colorado, and they had packed gas masks, ammunition, canned food, and other supplies. As the day went on, Kulp said, she began to think that the invasion wasn’t going to happen. “And then I thought, I’m going to have to go to school tomorrow.” In time, Kulp began to question her parents’ ideas. Her father became a pioneer in far-right radio, re-broadcasting the shows of Tom Valentine, who often promoted conspiracy theories and was accused of anti-Semitism. The family sometimes attended Aryan Nations training camps. “It was for whites only,” Kulp said. “It would teach you that whites were the supreme race, all of that shit.” She pointed to her heart: “It just didn’t fit in with this right here.” By the time Kulp was twenty, she had rejected her parents’ racism. She worked as a nurse, eventually specializing in geriatric care, and during the nineteen-eighties she participated in pro-choice demonstrations. Last autumn, she was energized by the Presidential election. In Grand Junction, the largest city in western Colorado, Kulp campaigned with a group of citizens who became active shortly after the release of the “Access Hollywood” recording, in which Trump was caught on tape bragging about assaulting women. One of the campaigners was a working mother named Lisa Gaizutis. Her eleven-year-old son had friends whose parents had declared that they would move to Canada if the election went the wrong way, so he did everything possible to free up his mother’s afternoons. “He said he’d take care of himself as long as I was campaigning,” Gaizutis remembered, after the election. “He’d text me and say, ‘You can stay late, I’m done with my homework.’ ” The majority of these activists were women, but their backgrounds were varied. Laureen Gutierrez’s ancestors had come from Spain via Mexico; Marjorie Haun was a special-education teacher who had left her job because of a vocal disability. Matt Patterson was a high-school dropout who, through a series of unlikely events, had acquired a classics degree from Columbia University. All of the activists had arrived in the same place, as fervent supporters of Donald Trump, and on the day of the Inauguration they met in Grand Junction to celebrate.

On January 20th, nearly two hundred people attended the Mesa County Republican Women’s DeploraBall. They watched a live feed of the Presidential Inaugural Ball, and they took photographs of one another next to cardboard cutouts of Donald Trump and Ronald Reagan, which had been arranged on the mezzanine of the Avalon Theatre. The theatre has an elegant Romanesque Revival façade, and it was built in the twenties, during one of the periodic resource-extraction booms that have shaped the city and its psyche. Grand Junction, with its surrounding area, has a population of some hundred and fifty thousand, and it sits in a wide, windswept valley. There are dry mountains and mesas on all sides, and the landscape gives the town a self-contained feel. Even its history revolves around events that were suffered alone. Residents often refer to their own “Black Sunday,” a date that’s meaningless anywhere else: May 2, 1982, when Exxon decided to abandon an enormous oil-shale project, with devastating effects on Grand Junction’s economy. The region is a Republican stronghold in a state that is starkly divided. Clinton won the Colorado popular vote by a modest margin, but Trump took nearly twice as many counties. The difference came from Denver and Boulder, two populous and liberal enclaves on the Front Range, the eastern side of the Rockies—the Colorado equivalents of New York and California. “Donald Trump lost those two counties by two hundred and seventy-three thousand votes, and he won the rest of the state by a hundred and forty thousand votes,” Steve House, the former chair of the state Republican Party, told me. “That means that most of Colorado, in my mind, is a conservative state.” It also means that Colorado’s economy and culture change dramatically from the Front Range to the Western Slope, on the other side of the Continental Divide. Between 2010 and 2015, the Front Range experienced ninety-six per cent of Colorado’s population growth, and the state’s unemployment rate is only 2.3 per cent. But Grand Junction lost eleven per cent of its workforce between 2009 and 2014, in part because the local energy industry collapsed in the wake of the worldwide drop in gas prices. Average annual family earnings are around ten thousand dollars less than the state figure. Most Grand Junction Republicans initially supported Ted Cruz, and, in August, 2016, after Trump won the nomination, a young first vice-chair of the county Party named Michael Lentz resigned. Lentz decided that advocating for Trump would contradict his Christian faith; he was particularly bothered by Trump’s attacks on immigrants and on the press. “I spent a month trying to come to grips with it, but I couldn’t,” Lentz told me. In October, Matt Patterson, who grew up in Grand Junction but now lives in Washington, D.C., returned to his home town to serve as the Party’s regional field director for the Presidential campaign. He lasted for four days. This was shortly after the “Access Hollywood” tape was leaked, and Patterson’s first act as field director was to propose that the Party hold a Women for Trump rally. But the county chairman refused. “His exact words were, ‘That’s picking a fight we can’t win,’ ” Patterson told me. He quit the campaign and organized the rally on his own. In his estimation, most Republicans would find Trump’s comments repugnant, but they would be even more resentful of the coastal media that was pushing the story. The Women for Trump rally was a local turning point. More than a hundred people showed up, and it galvanized a group of activists. Like other grassroots supporters across the country, they named themselves after Hillary Clinton’s comment that half of Trump’s adherents were racists, sexists, and others who belonged in a “basket of deplorables.” The Deplorables’ approach to the election was fiercely unapologetic. Karen Kulp told me that Trump wasn’t racist; he was simply calling for immigrants to be held accountable to the law. She said she would never support a hateful candidate, because her childhood contact with extremist groups had made her sensitive to such issues. For Kulp, who is in her mid-sixties and describes her income as limited, the campaign was empowering. Like many in Grand Junction, she believed that Trump would kick-start the local energy industry by reducing regulations. She told me that she had never shaken the sense that the country is under threat. “I think America is lost to us,” she said. “Because of the way I was raised, that is baggage that I will have for the rest of my life.” The Deplorables funded their own activities, and they pooled money in order to buy Trump shirts, hats, and buttons from Amazon, because the official campaign provided almost nothing. “I made about a dozen Amazon orders,” Kulp said, at the DeploraBall. “Every shirt you see here tonight, I bought.” At the Avalon, the crowd fell silent while a woman prayed: “Thank you for giving us a President who will, with your help, restore this nation to her former glory, the way you created her.” Less than two weeks later, the Deplorables effectively took over the county Republican leadership, with members winning three positions, including the chair. Others looked farther afield. “If Trump won Wisconsin, he could have won Colorado,” Patterson told me. “The issues were here—immigration and energy.” He believed that without the infighting of the last campaign they could do better. In 2018, there will be an election to replace John Hickenlooper, the Democratic Colorado governor, who will vacate his seat because of term limits. At the DeploraBall, Patterson told me that the Republicans can win the governorship and then, two years later, deliver Colorado to Trump. He said, “We’re going to start on the Western Slope and do a sweep east and color it red.”

Like many parts of America that strongly supported Trump, Grand Junction is a rural place with problems that have traditionally been associated with urban areas. In the past three years, felony filings have increased by nearly sixty-five per cent, and there are more than twice as many open homicide cases as there were a decade ago. There’s an epidemic of drug addiction and also of suicide: residents of Mesa County kill themselves at a rate that’s nearly two and a half times that of the nation. Some of this is tied to economic problems, but there’s also an issue of perception. The decrease in gas drilling weighs heavily on the minds of locals, although few people seem to realize that the energy industry now represents less than three per cent of local employment. They’ve been slow to embrace other sectors, such as health care and education, which seem to have more potential for future growth. During the campaign, Trump’s descriptions of inner-city crime and hopelessness often seemed cartoonish to urban residents, but not to rural voters—in Mesa County, Trump won nearly sixty-five per cent of the vote. Pueblo, another large rural Colorado county, has a steel industry that’s been on the wane since the nineteen-eighties. Its county seat now has the state’s highest homicide rate, and last election the county switched from blue to red. Far from Denver and Boulder, there are many places where an atmosphere of decline has lasted for two or more generations, leaving a profound impact on the outlook of young people. Matt Patterson told me that as a boy he had always hoped to escape his home town. In 1985, when he was twelve, almost fifteen per cent of the homes in Grand Junction were vacant, because of the effects of Black Sunday. Patterson’s dream was to become a magician. His parents were middle class—his father sold lumber; his mother worked in insurance—and they were upset when he dropped out of school at the beginning of tenth grade. He moved to South Florida, where he established himself as a specialist in closeup magic. He worked in restaurants, performing sleight-of-hand tricks for diners, and eventually he expanded into private parties, trade shows, and cruise ships. By his early twenties, he was earning more than forty thousand dollars a year. Years later, he described the experience as a “brutal education,” and he self-published a business manual for aspiring magicians. Some advice is technical: for magic, silver Liberty half-dollars are better than Kennedys; in low light, use cards that are red instead of blue. The manual was written long before Patterson entered politics, but any candidate would recognize the wisdom of sleight of hand. (“A good friend once told me that the only difference between a salesman and a con-man is that a salesman has confidence in his product.”) In 1997, Patterson was riding in a car that was hit by a drunk driver, and the bones of his left arm were shattered into several dozen pieces. After six surgeries, he suffered permanent nerve damage, decreased arm mobility, and no future as a closeup magician. Having acquired his G.E.D., he enrolled in classes at the University of Miami. The quality of Patterson’s writing impressed an instructor, who persuaded him to apply to Columbia. The year that Patterson turned thirty, he became an Ivy League freshman. He majored in classics. Every night, he translated four hundred lines of ancient Greek and Latin. In class, he often argued with professors and students. “The default view seemed to be that Western civilization is inherently bad,” he told me. In one history seminar, when students discussed the evils of the Western slave trade, Patterson pointed out that many cultures had practiced slavery, but that nobody decided to eradicate it until individuals in the West took up the cause. The class booed him. In Patterson’s opinion, most people at Columbia believed that only liberal views were legitimate, whereas his experiences in Grand Junction, and his textbook lessons from magic, indicated otherwise. (“States of mind are no different than feats of manual dexterity. Both can be learned through patience and diligence.”) “Look, I’m a high-school dropout who went to an Ivy League school,” Patterson said. “I’ve seen both sides. The people at Columbia are not smarter.” He continued, “I went to Columbia at the height of the Iraq War. There were really legitimate arguments against going into Iraq. But I found that the really good arguments against going were made by William F. Buckley, Bob Novak, and Pat Buchanan. What I saw on the left was all slogans and group thought and clichés.” Patterson graduated with honors and a reinvigorated sense of political conviction. For the past seven years, he’s worked for conservative nonprofit organizations, most recently in anti-union activism. In 2013, the United Auto Workers tried to unionize a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, where Patterson demonstrated a knack for billboards and catchphrases. On one sign, he paired a photograph of a hollowed-out Packard plant with the words “Detroit: Brought to You by the UAW.” Another billboard said “United Auto Workers,” with the word “Auto” crossed out and replaced by “Obama,” written in red. In Patterson’s opinion, such issues are cultural and emotional as much as economic. He believes that unions once served a critical function in American industry, but that the leadership, like that of the Democratic Party, has drifted too far from its base. Union heads back liberal candidates such as Obama and Clinton while dues-paying members tend to hold very different views. Patterson also thinks that free trade, which he once embraced as a conservative, has damaged American industries, and he now supports some more protectionist measures. His message resonated in Chattanooga, where, in 2014, workers delivered a stinging defeat to the U.A.W. Since then, Patterson has continued his advocacy in communities across the country, under the auspices of Americans for Tax Reform, which was founded by the conservative advocate Grover Norquist. “So now I bust unions for Grover Norquist with a classics degree and as a former magician,” he told me. As a magician, Patterson went by the name Magnus, taken from Albertus Magnus, the thirteenth-century saint and supposed alchemist. Patterson is of slightly less than average height, with features that are nondescript in a way that allows him to shift easily from one appearance to another. At the DeploraBall he wore a fedora, a pin-striped suit jacket, and eyeglasses with stylish John Varvatos frames. But at other times he dresses with the flair of a goth: black T-shirt, leather bracelet studded with skulls, silver ring decorated with a flying bat. Sometimes he paints his fingernails black. These accessories vanish when it’s time to interact with factory workers, voters, or Republicans in Middle America. In July, 2016, Patterson bet a friend two hundred dollars that Trump would win the Presidency. His conservative Washington friends didn’t take Trump seriously, but Patterson believed that the candidate’s ability to connect with voters was uncanny. (“Remember that you will be performing for people of varying degrees of education, in varying degrees of sobriety, and your routines must be easily understood by all of them.”)

Last October, three weeks before the election, Donald Trump visited Grand Junction for a rally in an airport hangar. Along with other members of the press, I was escorted into a pen near the back, where a metal fence separated us from the crowd. At that time, some prominent polls showed Clinton leading by more than ten percentage points, and Trump often claimed that the election might be rigged. During the rally he said, “There’s a voter fraud also with the media, because they so poison the minds of the people by writing false stories.” He pointed in our direction, describing us as “criminals,” among other things: “They’re lying, they’re cheating, they’re stealing! They’re doing everything, these people right back here!” The attacks came every few minutes, and they served as a kind of tether to the speech. The material could have drifted off into abstraction—e-mails, Benghazi, the Washington swamp. But every time Trump pointed at the media, the crowd turned, and by the end people were screaming and cursing at us. One man tried to climb over the barrier, and security guards had to drag him away. Such behavior is out of character for residents of rural Colorado, where politeness and public decency are highly valued. Erin McIntyre, a Grand Junction native who works for the Daily Sentinel , the local paper, stood in the crowd, where the people around her screamed at the journalists: “Lock them up!” “Hang them all!” “Electric chair!” Afterward, McIntyre posted a description of the event on Facebook. “I thought I knew Mesa County,” she wrote. “That’s not what I saw yesterday. And it scared me.” Before Trump took office, people I met in Grand Junction emphasized pragmatic reasons for supporting him. The economy was in trouble, and Trump was a businessman who knew how to make rational, profit-oriented decisions. Supporters almost always complained about some aspect of his character, but they also believed that these flaws were likely to help him succeed in Washington. “I’m not voting for him to be my pastor,” Kathy Rehberg, a local real-estate agent, said. “I’m voting for him to be President. If I have rats in my basement, I’m going to try to find the best rat killer out there. I don’t care if he’s ugly or if he’s sociable. All I care about is if he kills rats.” “Don’t worry, we only went out once. I never saw him naked—not until now, of course.” After the turbulent first two months of the Administration, I met again with Kathy Rehberg and her husband, Ron. They were satisfied with Trump’s performance, and their complaints about his behavior were mild. “I think some of it is funny, how he doesn’t let people push him around,” Ron Rehberg said. Over time, such remarks became more common. “I hate to say it, but I wake up in the morning looking forward to what else is coming,” Ray Scott, a Republican state senator who had campaigned for Trump, told me in June. One lawyer said bluntly, “I get a kick in the ass out of him.” The calculus seemed to have shifted: Trump’s negative qualities, which once had been described as a means to an end, now had value of their own. The point wasn’t necessarily to get things done; it was to retaliate against the media and other enemies. This had always seemed fundamental to Trump’s appeal, but people had been less likely to express it so starkly before he entered office. “For those of us who believe that the media has been corrupt for a lot of years, it’s a way of poking at the jellyfish,” Karen Kulp told me in late April. “Just to make them mad.”

In Grand Junction, people wanted Trump to accomplish certain things with the pragmatism of a businessman, but they also wanted him to make them feel a certain way. The assumption has always been that, while emotional appeal might have mattered during the campaign, the practical impact of a Trump Presidency would prove more important. Liberals claimed that Trump would fail because his policies would hurt the people who had voted for him. But the lack of legislative accomplishment seems only to make supporters take more satisfaction in Trump’s behavior. And thus far the President’s tone, rather than his policies, has had the greatest impact on Grand Junction. This was evident even before the election, with the behavior of supporters at the candidate’s rally, the conflicts within the local Republican Party, and an increased distrust of anything having to do with government. Sheila Reiner, a Republican who serves as the county clerk, said that during the campaign she had dealt with many allegations of fraud following Trump’s claims that the election could be rigged. “People came in and said, ‘I want to see where you’re tearing up the ballots!’ ” Reiner told me. Reiner and her staff gave at least twenty impromptu tours of their office, in an attempt to convince voters that the Republican county clerk wasn’t trying to throw the election to Clinton. The Daily Sentinel publishes editorials from both the right and the left, and it didn’t endorse a Presidential candidate. But supporters picked up on Trump’s obsession with crowd size, repeatedly accusing the Sentinel of underestimating attendance at rallies. The paper ran a story about vandalism of political signs, with examples given from both campaigns, but readers were outraged that the photograph featured only a torn Clinton banner. The Sentinel immediately ran a second article with a photograph of a vandalized Trump sign. When Erin McIntyre described the Grand Junction rally on Facebook, online attacks by Trump supporters were so vicious that she feared for her safety. After three days, she deleted the post. In February, a bill that was intended to give journalists better access to government records was introduced in a Colorado senate committee, which was chaired by Ray Scott, a Republican. The process was delayed for unknown reasons, and the Sentinel published an editorial with a mild prompt: “We call on our own Sen. Scott to announce a new committee hearing date and move this bill forward.” Scott responded with a series of Trump-style tweets. “We have our own fake news in Grand Junction,” he wrote. “The very liberal GJ Sentinel is attempting to apply pressure for me to move a bill.” Jay Seaton, the Sentinel’s publisher, threatened to sue Scott for defamation. In an editorial , he wrote, “When a state senator accused The Sentinel of being fake news, he was deliberately attempting to delegitimize a credible news source in order to avoid being held accountable by it.” The Huffington Post and other national outlets mentioned the spat. When I met with Scott, he seemed pleased by the attention. A burly, friendly man who works as a contractor, he told me, “I was kind of Trumpish before Trump was cool.” “We used to just take it on the chin if somebody said something about us,” he said. “The fake-news thing became the popular thing to say, because of Trump.” He believed that Trump has performed a service by popularizing the term. “I’ve seen journalists like yourself doing a better job,” Scott told me. He’s considering a run for governor, in part because of Trump’s example. “People are looking for something different,” he said. “They’re looking for somebody who means what they say.” In late February, shortly after the exchange between Scott and Seaton, an entrepreneur named Tyler Riehl started a campaign against the Sentinel . He wrote on Facebook, “If I’ve learned one thing from Donald Trump’s election it’s that we can ignore the political pundits telling us we must play nice with the press—even when they’re crooked and dishonest.” Riehl announced a five-hundred-dollar reward for anybody exposing “local media malfeasance,” and he fashioned a hundred newspaper delivery boxes decorated with a “Ghostbusters”-style icon that read, “ FAKE NEWS .” Riehl distributed the boxes at a rally called Toast for Trump, which was dutifully covered by the Sentinel , along with a fact-checked head count (a hundred and twenty). In Grand Junction, I learned to suspend any customary assumptions regarding political identity. I encountered countless strong working women, some of whom believed in abortion rights, who had voted for Trump. Cultural cues could be misleading: I interviewed one gentle, hippieish Trump voter who wore his gray hair in a ponytail. An experience like leaving a small town for an Ivy League college, which might lead some people to embrace more liberal ideas, could inspire in others a deeper conservatism. And so I wasn’t entirely surprised to learn that Tyler Riehl, like me, was a former Peace Corps volunteer. He had served in Slovakia. “Every time you get to look at how somebody else lives, it gives you perspective that’s useful,” Riehl told me. In 2000, he was sent to a village in eastern Slovakia, where he advocated for bicyclists’ rights. Riehl told me that living in a post-Communist society strengthened his appreciation for freedom, truth, and the virtues of small government. Now he was applying that idealism to his current campaign. “I do unequivocally state that the Sentinel is full of fake news,” he said. Some residents found these attacks deeply misguided. “I think there’s a lot of emotion involved, and people are bringing opinions from the national debate into the local arena,” Bill Vrettos, a consultant with the Alternative Board, which advises businesses, told me. He described his politics as “radically middle-of-the-road,” and he didn’t believe that the Sentinel was slanted. In his opinion, a small-town newspaper plays a different role from that of a big publication, and he mentioned a recent incident in which two high-school students had killed themselves within a twenty-four-hour period. Before the Sentinel reported anything, Seaton, the publisher, had organized a meeting with school officials, mental-health experts, a suicide task force, and the father of a boy who had killed himself. The experts warned about copycat suicides, so the newspaper kept the deaths off the front page. I met with Seaton at the Sentinel’s downtown office, where a conference-room wall is decorated with two framed front pages that reported the news from historically tragic dates: September 11, 2001, and May 2, 1982. The building has a three-level Goss printing press that is capable of turning out a hundred and fifty thousand issues per hour, because it was purchased in the early eighties, when people once again thought the oil-shale industry was about to take off. The current circulation is around twenty-five thousand. Seaton is from a Kansas-based family that owns eight newspapers around the Midwest; in 2009, they acquired the Sentinel . “I come from a long line of Republicans,” he told me. “My great-uncle served in Eisenhower’s Cabinet as Interior Secretary.” But he admitted that he finds it increasingly difficult to reconcile himself to today’s conservative movement. “The Party is too accommodating of elements that I would consider fringe, bordering on hate groups,” he said. Seaton formerly worked as a corporate lawyer, and he believed that he had a valid case of defamation against Ray Scott. But he had decided not to proceed with a lawsuit. He worried that Trump uses the term “fake news” so often that its interpretation might change by the time a case reached judgment. “Maybe those words have lost their objective meaning,” Seaton said. During the election season, it’s common for some people to cancel their subscriptions, but last year the Sentinel lost more of them than usual. That’s one of the ironies of the age: the New York Times and the Washington Post , which Trump often attacks by name, have gained subscribers and public standing, while a small institution like the Sentinel has been damaged within its community. Seaton didn’t know how to handle the fake-news accusations, although he had considered inviting Tyler Riehl to shadow a reporter for a day. He had also thought about doubling the reward for local media malfeasance. That five hundred dollars still hasn’t been claimed.

In the past eight months, I have never heard anybody express regret for voting for Donald Trump. If anything, investigations into the Trump campaign’s connections with Russia have made supporters only more faithful. “I’m loving it—I hope they keep going down the Russia rabbit hole,” Matt Patterson told me, in June. He believes that Democrats are banking on an impeachment instead of doing the hard work of trying to connect with voters. “They didn’t even get rid of their leadership after the election,” he said. But Trump’s connection with supporters also involves a great risk. Many Presidential acts that feel satisfying—the unfiltered insults, the attacks on institutions—also make it difficult to achieve anything practical and positive. And the resulting legislative failures typically inspire more emotion. In late June, after the Senate delayed a vote on the health-care bill, Trump embarked on a Twitter spree, labelling various organizations fake news and claiming that Mika Brzezinski, the MSNBC host, had recently had a facelift that left her bleeding in public. Excuses are naturally built into this toxic cycle. Supporters can always say that Trump was never given a chance, and that the media, the Russia investigation, and other conspiracies have worked against him. In such a climate, it’s difficult to prove incompetence: true pragmatism would be quick and dirty, but emotional cycles can be sustained for much longer. I find it easy to imagine myself at a rally in 2020, standing in a pen while people scream at me. Smaller places may also be particularly vulnerable to the President’s negative tone, which makes it harder to find practical solutions to local problems. In Grand Junction, the average age of a school building is forty-four years, and the district is ranked a hundred and seventy-first out of a hundred and seventy-eight in the state, in terms of funding per student. Property taxes, which fund the schools, are among the lowest of Colorado cities. In November, two measures that would increase school funding will be on the ballot, but the last time such a proposal came to a vote, in 2011, it was rejected. Voters have also not approved an increase in the sales tax since 1989. The next ballot will propose a rise of about a third of one per cent, in order to fund local law enforcement and public-safety services. Even as crime has risen, resources have dropped; the county currently has 1.15 deputies per thousand residents, in comparison with a state average of 2.28. Police departments are so understaffed that many areas aren’t patrolled. “They just bounce from service call to service call,” Daniel Rubinstein, the Republican district attorney, told me. Approximately fourteen per cent of the population is Hispanic, although that figure would be higher if it included undocumented immigrants. When I asked Rubinstein about people who don’t have legal status, he said, “That’s never been a significant proportion of our crime problem.” Trump supporters also seemed to understand this. I never heard anybody blame Hispanics for local crime, or make racist remarks about them; it was much more common to encounter Islamophobia, although the nearest mosque is about four hours away. In a climate of intense distrust of government, it will be particularly difficult to persuade voters to approve new funding. Some residents told me that they want further cuts in education—even in the high desert they were determined to drain the swamp. But there are long-term costs to this mentality. One bright spot in the economy has been the growth of Colorado Mesa University, the largest institution of higher education on the Western Slope, but it’s hard to become a true college town when public schools are so badly underfunded. In June, at an economic conference at the university, I met Erik Valk, the founder of Principelle, a Dutch company that manufactures medical devices. Valk was thinking about opening a production center in Grand Junction, because he loved the natural setting, but he was concerned that the culture might be too inward-looking. “I’m trying to discover if there is a trend in this direction—whether they want to open to the world,” Valk said. “I spoke with the sheriff this morning and he has a funding problem, and he has a crime problem.” One person told me half in jest that the best way to get voters to approve new funding would be to blame everything on a lack of support by Denver élites: a tax increase in the guise of rugged self-reliance. “It’s about creating an us-versus-them victim narrative,” he said. He was being cynical, but he was also acknowledging the power of perspective and feeling. This seems to be the weakness of the Democratic Party, which often gives people the impression that they are being informed of their logical best interests. On the other side, people feel ignored or insulted—this was why they responded so strongly to Clinton’s use of the term “deplorables.” “What she said was, ‘If you don’t vote for me, you’re morally unworthy to talk to, to take seriously,’ ” Patterson told me. In Grand Junction, it was often dispiriting to see such enthusiasm for a figure who could become the ultimate political boom-and-bust. There was idealism, too, and so many pro-Trump opinions were the fruit of powerful and legitimate life experiences. “We just assume that if someone voted for Trump that they’re racist and uneducated,” Jeriel Brammeier, the twenty-six-year-old chair of the local Democratic Party, told me. “We can’t think about it like that.” People have reasons for the things that they believe, and the intensity of their experiences can’t be taken for granted; it’s not simply a matter of having Fox News on in the background. But perhaps this is a way to distinguish between the President and his supporters. Almost everybody I met in Grand Junction seemed more complex, more interesting, and more decent than the man who inspires them. During my conversation with Brammeier, I asked why she had entered politics. “I got pregnant when I was sixteen,” she said. Grand Junction has a high teen-pregnancy rate, and Brammeier had been one of eight girls, out of about two hundred in her twelfth-grade year, who had babies. The town has no Planned Parenthood clinic or designated abortion provider, and in 2015, for reasons both fiscal and ideological, the Republican-controlled state senate voted down a bill that would have provided funding for an effective state-wide contraception program. “Our state senator Ray Scott voted to defund it,” Brammeier said. Private funds filled the gap until last year, when it was included in the state budget. Brammeier told me that she wants to improve the community for her daughter: “She was on my back when she was three months old, and I was canvassing for Obama.” Who could stand before this woman and deny the power of her experience? But that was true on both sides; there were many hard-earned faiths in Grand Junction."
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/how-not-to-solve-the-refugee-crisis,newyorker,How Not to Solve the Refugee Crisis,[],"On October 3, 2013, a Sicilian prosecutor named Calogero Ferrara was in his office in the Palace of Justice, in Palermo, when he read a disturbing news story. Before dawn, a fishing trawler carrying more than five hundred East African migrants from Libya had stalled a quarter of a mile from Lampedusa, a tiny island halfway to Sicily. The driver had dipped a cloth in leaking fuel and ignited it, hoping to draw help. But the fire quickly spread, and as passengers rushed away the boat capsized, trapping and killing hundreds of people. The Central Mediterranean migration crisis was entering a new phase. Each week, smugglers were cramming hundreds of African migrants into small boats and launching them in the direction of Europe, with little regard for the chances of their making it. Mass drownings had become common. Still, the Lampedusa shipwreck was striking for its scale and its proximity: Italians watched from the cliffs as the coast guard spent a week recovering the corpses. As news crews descended on the island, the coffins were laid out in an airplane hangar and topped with roses and Teddy bears. “It shocked me, because, maybe for the first time, they decided to show pictures of the coffins,” Ferrara told me. Italy declared a day of national mourning and started carrying out search-and-rescue operations near Libyan waters. Shortly afterward, a group of survivors in Lampedusa attacked a man whom they recognized from the boat, claiming that he had been the driver and that he was affiliated with smugglers in Libya. The incident changed the way that Ferrara thought about the migration crisis. “I went to the chief prosecutor and said, ‘Look, we have three hundred and sixty-eight dead people in territory under our jurisdiction,’ ” Ferrara said. “We spend I don’t know how much energy and resources on a single Mafia hit, where one or two people are killed.” If smuggling networks were structured like the Mafia, Ferrara realized, arresting key bosses could lead to fewer boats and fewer deaths at sea. The issue wasn’t only humanitarian. With each disembarkation, public opinion was hardening against migrants, and the political appetite for accountability for their constant arrivals was growing. Ferrara’s office regarded smugglers in Africa and Europe as a transnational criminal network, and every boat they sent across the Mediterranean as a crime against Italy. Ferrara is confident and ambitious, a small man in his forties with brown, curly hair, a short-cropped beard, and a deep, gravelly voice. The walls of his office are hung with tributes to his service and his success. When I met with him, in May, he sat with his feet on his desk, wearing teal-rimmed glasses and smoking a Toscano cigar. Shelves bowed under dozens of binders, each containing thousands of pages of documents—transcripts of wiretaps and witness statements for high-profile criminal cases. In the hall, undercover cops with pistols tucked beneath their T-shirts waited to escort prosecutors wherever they went. Sicilian prosecutors are granted tremendous powers, which stem from their reputation as the only thing standing between society and the Cosa Nostra. Beginning in the late nineteen-seventies, the Sicilian Mafia waged a vicious war against the Italian state. Its adherents assassinated journalists, prosecutors, judges, police officers, and politicians, and terrorized their colleagues into submission. As Alexander Stille writes in “ Excellent Cadavers ,” from 1995, the only way to prove that you weren’t colluding with the Mafia was to be killed by it. In 1980, after it was leaked that Gaetano Costa, the chief prosecutor of Palermo, had signed fifty-five arrest warrants, he was gunned down in the street by the Cosa Nostra. Three years later, his colleague Rocco Chinnici was killed by a car bomb. In response, a small group of magistrates formed an anti-Mafia pool; each member agreed to put his name on every prosecutorial order, so that none could be singled out for assassination. By 1986, the anti-Mafia team was ready to bring charges against four hundred and seventy-five mobsters, in what became known as the “maxi-trial,” the world’s largest Mafia proceeding. The trial was held inside a massive bunker in Palermo, constructed for the occasion, whose walls could withstand an attack by rocket-propelled grenades. Led by Giovanni Falcone, the prosecutors secured three hundred and forty-four convictions. A few years after the trial, Falcone took a job in Rome. But on May 23, 1992, as he was returning home to Palermo, the Cosa Nostra detonated half a ton of explosives under the highway near the airport, killing Falcone, his wife, and his police escorts. The explosives, left over from ordnance that was dropped during the Second World War, had been collected by divers from the bottom of the Mediterranean; the blast was so large that it registered on earthquake monitors. Fifty-seven days later, mobsters killed one of the remaining members of the anti-Mafia pool, Falcone’s friend and investigative partner Paolo Borsellino. Following these murders, the Italian military dispatched seven thousand troops to Sicily. Prosecutors were now allowed to wiretap anyone suspected of having connections to organized crime. They also had the authority to lead investigations, rather than merely argue the findings in court, and to give Mafia witnesses incentives for coöperation. That year, magistrates in Milan discovered a nationwide corruption system; its exposure led to the dissolution of local councils, the destruction of Italy’s major political parties, and the suicides of a number of businessmen and politicians who had been named for taking bribes. More than half the members of the Italian parliament came under investigation. “The people looked to the prosecutors as the only hope for the country,” a Sicilian journalist told me. Shortly after the Lampedusa tragedy, Ferrara, with assistance from the Ministry of Interior, helped organize a team of élite prosecutors and investigators. When investigating organized crime, “for which we are famous in Palermo,” Ferrara said, “you can request wiretappings or interception of live communications with a threshold of evidence that is much lower than for common crimes.” In practice, “it means that when you request of the investigative judge an interception for organized crime, ninety-nine per cent of the time you get it.” Because rescue boats routinely deposit migrants at Sicilian ports, most weeks were marked by the arrivals of more than a thousand potential witnesses. Ferrara’s team started collecting information at disembarkations and migrant-reception centers, and before long they had the phone numbers of drivers, hosts, forgers, and money agents. The investigation was named Operation Glauco, for Glaucus, a Greek deity with prophetic powers who came to the rescue of sailors in peril. According to Ferrara, Sicily’s proximity to North Africa enabled his investigators to pick up calls in which both speakers were in Africa. Italian telecommunications companies often serve as a data hub for Internet traffic and calls. “We have conversations in Khartoum passing through Palermo,” he said. By monitoring phone calls, investigators gradually reconstructed an Eritrean network that had smuggled tens of thousands of East Africans to Europe on boats that left from Libya. By 2015, the Glauco investigations had resulted in dozens of arrests in Italy, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Most of the suspects were low-level figures who may not have been aware that they were committing a crime by, for example, taking money to drive migrants from a migrant camp in Sicily to a connection house—a temporary shelter, run by smugglers—in Milan. But the bosses in Africa seemed untouchable. “In Libya, we know who they are and where they are,” Ferrara said. “But the problem is that you can’t get any kind of coöperation” from local forces. The dragnet indicated that an Eritrean, based in Tripoli, was at the center of the network. He was born in 1981, and his name was Medhanie Yehdego Mered. “It’s great to see so many new faces here tonight!”

On May 23, 2014, Ferrara’s investigative team started wiretapping Mered’s Libyan number. Mered’s network in Tripoli was linked to recruiters and logisticians in virtually every major population center in East Africa. With each boat’s departure, he earned tens of thousands of dollars. In July, Mered told an associate, in a wiretapped call, that he had smuggled between seven and eight thousand people to Europe. In October, he moved to Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, for two months. The Italians found his Facebook page and submitted into evidence a photograph of a dour man wearing a blue shirt and a silver chain with a large crucifix. “This is Medhanie,” a migrant who had briefly worked for him told prosecutors in Rome. “He is a king in Libya. He’s very respected. He’s one of the few—perhaps the only one—who can go out with a cross around his neck.” In 2015, a hundred and fifty thousand refugees and migrants crossed from Libya to Europe, and almost three thousand drowned. Each Thursday afternoon, Eritreans tune in to Radio Erena, a Tigrinya-language station, for a show hosted by the Swedish-Eritrean journalist and activist Meron Estefanos. Broadcasting from her kitchen, in Stockholm, she is in touch with hundreds of migrants, activists, and smugglers. Often, when Estefanos criticizes a smuggler, he will call in to her program to complain. In February, 2015, Estefanos reported that men who worked for Mered were raping female migrants. Mered called in to deny the rape allegations, but he admitted other bad practices and attempted to justify them. “I asked, ‘Why do you send people without life jackets?’ ” Estefanos said. “And he said, ‘I can’t buy life jackets, because if I buy five hundred life jackets I will be suspected of being a smuggler.’ ” He told Estefanos it was true that people went hungry in his connection house, but that it wasn’t his fault. “My people in Sudan—I tell them to send me five hundred refugees, and they send me two thousand,” he said. “I got groceries for five hundred people, and now I have to make it work!” Mered was becoming wealthy, but he wasn’t the kingpin that some considered him to be. In the spring of 2013, after arriving in Libya as a refugee, he negotiated passage to Tripoli by helping smugglers with menial tasks. Then, in June, he began working with a Libyan man named Ali, whose family owned an empty building near the sea, which could be used as a connection house. According to Mered’s clients, he instructed associates in other parts of East Africa to tell migrants that they worked for Abdulrazzak, known among Eritreans as one of the most powerful smugglers. Those who were duped into paying Mered’s team were furious when they reached the connection house and learned that Mered and Ali were not connected to Abdulrazzak, and that they had failed to strike a deal with the men who launched the boats. When the pair eventually arranged their first departure, all three vessels were intercepted before they could leave Libyan waters, and the passengers were jailed. By the end of the summer, more than three hundred and fifty migrants were languishing in the connection house. Finally, in September, a fleet of taxis shuttled them to the beach in small groups to board boats. Five days later, the Italian coast guard rescued Mered’s passengers and, therefore, his reputation as a smuggler as well. In December, Mered brought hundreds of migrants to the beach, including an Eritrean I’ll call Yonas. “He was sick of Tripoli,” Yonas told me. “He was ready to come with us—to take the sea trip.” But the shores were controlled by Libyans; to them, Mered’s ability to organize payments and speak with East African migrants in Tigrinya was an invaluable part of the business. Ali started shouting at Mered and slapping him. “That’s when I understood that he was not that powerful,” Yonas recalled. “Our lives depended on the Libyans, not on Medhanie. To them, he was no better than any of us—he was just another Eritrean refugee.”

In April, 2015, the Palermo magistrate’s office issued a warrant for Mered’s arrest. The authorities also released the photograph of him wearing a crucifix, in the hope that someone might give him up. Days later, Mered’s face appeared in numerous European publications. News of Mered’s indictment spread quickly in Libya. One night, Mered called Estefanos in a panic. “It’s like a fatwa against me,” he said. “They put my life in danger.” He claimed that, in the days after he was named in the press, he had been kidnapped three times; a Libyan general had negotiated his release. Mered asked Estefanos what would happen to him if he tried to come to Europe to be with his wife, Lidya Tesfu, who had crossed the Mediterranean and given birth to their son in Sweden the previous year. It was as if he hadn’t fully grasped the Italian case against him. Not only did Mered think that the Italians had exaggerated his importance but “he saw himself as a kind of activist, helping people who were desperate,” Estefanos told me. Shortly before midnight on June 6, 2015, Mered called Estefanos, sounding drunk or high. “He didn’t want me to ask questions,” she told me. “He said, ‘Just listen.’ ” During the next three hours, Mered detailed his efforts to rescue several Eritrean hostages from the Islamic State, which had established a base in Sirte, Libya. Now, Mered said, he was driving out of Libya, toward the Egyptian border, with four of the women in the back of his truck. As Estefanos remembers it, “Mered said, ‘I’m holding a Kalashnikov and a revolver, to defend myself. If something happens at the Egyptian-Libyan border, I’m not going to surrender. I’m going to kill as many as I can, and die myself. Wish me luck!’ ” He never called again. From that point forward, Estefanos occasionally heard from Mered’s associates, some of whom wanted to betray him and take over the business. Mered was photographed at a wedding in Sudan and spotted at a bar in Ethiopia. He posted photos to Facebook from a mall in Dubai. Italian investigators lost track of him. But on January 21, 2016, Ferrara received a detailed note from Roy Godding, an official from Britain’s National Crime Agency, which leads the country’s efforts against organized crime and human trafficking. Godding wrote that the agency was “in possession of credible and sustained evidence” that Mered had a residence in Khartoum, and that he “spends a significant amount of his time in that city.” The N.C.A. believed that Mered would leave soon—possibly by the end of April—and so, Godding wrote, “we have to act quickly.” Still, Godding had concerns. In Sudan, people-smuggling can carry a penalty of death, which was abolished in the United Kingdom more than fifty years ago. If the Italian and British governments requested Mered’s capture, Godding said, he should be extradited to Italy, spending “as little time as possible” in Sudanese custody. Although Godding’s sources believed that Mered had “corrupt relationships” with Sudanese authorities, he figured that the N.C.A. and the Palermo magistrate could work through “trusted partners” within the regime. (Sudan’s President has been charged in absentia by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity, but the European Union pays his government tens of millions of euros each year to contain migration.) Ferrara’s team began drawing up an extradition request. The Palermo magistrate had already started wiretapping Mered’s Sudanese number, and also that of his wife, Tesfu, and his brother Merhawi, who had immigrated to the Netherlands two years earlier. The taps on Mered’s number yielded no results. But, on March 19th, Merhawi mentioned in a call that a man named Filmon had told him that Mered was in Dubai and would probably return to Khartoum soon. In mid- May, the N.C.A. informed Ferrara’s team of a new Sudanese telephone number that they suspected was being used by Mered. The Palermo magistrate started wiretapping it immediately. On May 24th, as the Sudanese authorities welcomed European delegates to an international summit on halting migration and human trafficking, the police tracked the location of the phone and made an arrest. Two weeks later, the suspect was extradited to Italy on a military jet. The next morning, at a press conference in Palermo, the prosecutors announced that they had captured Medhanie Yehdego Mered. “Whoever pulls it out becomes King of Britain, but Phil licked the handle, so . . .” Coverage of the arrest ranged from implausible to absurd. The BBC erroneously reported that Mered had presided over a “multibillion-dollar empire.” A British tabloid claimed that he had given millions of dollars to the Islamic State. The N.C.A., which had spent years hunting for Mered, issued a press release incorrectly stating that he was “responsible for the Lampedusa tragedy.” Meanwhile, the Palermo prosecutor’s office reportedly said that Mered had styled himself in the manner of Muammar Qaddafi, and that he was known among smugglers as the General—even though the only reference to that nickname came from a single wiretapped call from 2014 that, according to the official transcript, was conducted “in an ironic tone.” Ferrara boasted that Mered had been “one of the four most important human smugglers in Africa.” On June 10th, the suspect was interrogated by three prosecutors from the Palermo magistrate. The chief prosecutor, Francesco Lo Voi, asked if he understood the accusations against him. “Why did you tell me that I’m Medhanie Yehdego?” the man replied. “Did you understand the accusations against you?” Lo Voi repeated. “Yes,” he said. “But why did you tell me that I’m Medhanie Yehdego?” “Yeah, apart from the name . . .”

Lo Voi can’t have been surprised by the suspect’s question. Two days earlier, when the Italians released a video of the man in custody—handcuffed and looking scared, as he descended from the military jet—Estefanos received phone calls from Eritreans on at least four continents. Most were perplexed. “This guy doesn’t even look like him,” an Eritrean refugee who was smuggled from Libya by Mered said. He figured that the Italians had caught Mered but used someone else’s picture from stock footage. For one caller in Khartoum, a woman named Seghen, however, the video solved a mystery: she had been looking for her brother for more than two weeks, and was stunned to see him on television. She said that her brother was more than six years younger than Mered; their only common traits were that they were Eritreans named Medhanie. Estefanos told me, “I didn’t know how to contact the Italians, so I contacted Patrick Kingsley,” the Guardian’s migration correspondent, whose editor arranged for him to work with Lorenzo Tondo, a Sicilian journalist in Palermo. That evening, just before sunset, Ferrara received a series of messages from Tondo, on WhatsApp. “Gery, call me—there’s some absurd news going around,” Tondo, who knew Ferrara from previous cases, wrote. “The Guardian just contacted me. They’re saying that, according to some Eritrean sources, the man in custody is not Mered.” Ferrara was not deterred, but he was irritated that the Sudanese hadn’t passed along any identification papers or fingerprints. That night, Tondo and Kingsley wrote in the Guardian that Italian and British investigators were “looking into whether the Sudanese had sent them the wrong man.” Soon afterward, one of Ferrara’s superiors informed Tondo that the prosecution office would no longer discuss the arrest. “I’ve decided on a press blackout,” he said. In recent years, smuggling trials in Italy have often been shaped more by politics than by the pursuit of truth or justice. As long as Libya is in chaos, there is no way to prevent crowded dinghies from reaching international waters, where most people who aren’t rescued will drown. At disembarkations, police officers sometimes use the threat of arrest to coerce refugees into identifying whichever migrant had been tasked with driving the boat, then charge him as a smuggler. The accused is typically represented by a public defender who doesn’t speak his language or have the time, the resources, or the understanding of the smuggling business to build a credible defense. Those who were driving boats in which people drowned are often charged with manslaughter. Hundreds of migrants have been convicted in this way, giving a veneer of success to an ineffective strategy for slowing migration. When the man being held as Mered was assigned state representation, Tondo intervened. “I knew that this guy was not going to be properly defended,” he told me. “And, if there was a chance that he was innocent, it was my duty—not as a journalist but as a human—to help him. So I put the state office in touch with my friend Michele Calantropo,” a defense lawyer who had previously worked on migration issues. For Tondo, the arrangement was also strategic. “The side effect was that now I had an important source of information inside the case,” he said. On June 10th, in the interrogation room, the suspect was ordered to provide his personal details. He picked up a pencil and started slowly writing in Tigrinya. For almost two minutes, the only sound was birdsong from an open window. An interpreter read his testimony for the record: “My name is Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe, born in Asmara on May 12, 1987.”

That afternoon, Berhe, Calantropo, and three prosecutors met with a judge. “If you give false testimony regarding your identity, it is a crime in Italy,” the judge warned. Berhe testified that he had lived in Asmara, the capital of Eritrea. Like many other refugees, he had fled the country during his mandatory military service. “So, what kind of work have you done in your life?” the judge asked. “I was a carpenter. And I sold milk.” “You what?” “I sold milk.” “Are you married?” “No,” Berhe said. “Who did you live with in Asmara?” “My mom.” “O.K., Mr. Medhanie,” the judge said. “I’m now going to read you the, um, the crimes—the things you’re accused of doing.” “O.K.” The judge spent the next several minutes detailing a complex criminal enterprise that spanned eleven countries and three continents, and involved numerous accomplices, thousands of migrants, and millions of euros in illicit profits. She listed several boatloads of people who had passed through Mered’s connection house and arrived in Italy in 2014. Berhe sat in silence as the interpreter whispered rapidly into his ear. After the judge finished listing the crimes, she asked Berhe, “So, what do you have to say about this?” “I didn’t do it,” he replied. “In 2014, I was in Asmara, so those dates don’t even make sense.” “And where did you go after you left Asmara?” “I went to Ethiopia, where I stayed for three months. And then I went to Sudan.” There, Berhe had failed to find a job, so he lived with several other refugees. Berhe and his sister were supported by sporadic donations of three hundred dollars from a brother who lives in the United States. Berhe had spent the past two and a half weeks in isolation, but his testimony matched the accounts of friends and relatives who had spoken to Estefanos and other members of the press. “Listen, I have to ask you something,” the judge said. “Do you even know Medhanie Yehdego Mered?” “No,” Berhe replied. “I don’t have any more questions,” the judge said. “Anyone else?” “Your honor, whatever the facts he just put forward, in reality he is the right defendant,” Claudio Camilleri, one of the prosecutors, said. “He was delivered to us as Mered,” he insisted, pointing to the extradition forms. “You can read it very clearly: ‘Mered.’ ” Along with Berhe, the Sudanese government had handed over a cell phone, a small calendar, and some scraps of paper, which it said were the only objects in Berhe’s possession at the time of the arrest. But when the judge asked Berhe if he owned a passport he said yes. “It’s in Sudan,” he said. “They took it. It was in my pocket, but they took it.” “Excuse me—at the moment of the arrest, you had your identity documents with you?” she asked. “Yes, I had them. But they took my I.D.” Berhe told his lawyer that the Sudanese police had beaten him and asked for money. As a jobless refugee, he had nothing to give, so they notified Interpol that they had captured Mered. The prosecutors also focussed on his mobile phone, which had been tapped shortly before he was arrested. “The contents of these conversations touched on illicit activities of the sort relevant to this dispute,” Camilleri said. At the time, Berhe’s cousin had been migrating through Libya, en route to Europe, and he had called Berhe to help arrange a payment to the connection man. “So, you know people who are part of the organizations that send migrants,” the judge noted. “Why were they calling you, if you are a milkman?” The interrogation continued in this manner, with the authorities regarding as suspicious everything that they didn’t understand about the lives of refugees who travel the perilous routes that they were trying to disrupt. At one point, Berhe found himself explaining the fundamentals of the hawala system—an untraceable money-transfer network built on trust between distant brokers—to a prosecutor who had spent years investigating smugglers whose business depends on it. When Berhe mentioned that one of his friends in Khartoum worked at a bar, the judge heard barche , the Italian word for boats. “He sells boats?” she asked. “No, no,” Berhe said. “He sells fruit juice.” “Great—now we’re endangered and reviled.” The prosecutors also asked Berhe about the names of various suspects in the Glauco investigations. But in most cases they knew only smugglers’ nicknames or first names, many of which are common in Eritrea. Berhe, recognizing some of the names as those of his friends and relatives, began to implicate himself. “Mera Merhawi?” a prosecutor asked. Mered’s brother is named Merhawi. “Well, Mera is just short for Merhawi,” Berhe explained. “O.K., you had a conversation with . . .” “Yes! Merhawi is in Libya. He left with my cousin Gherry.” Believing that coöperation was the surest path to exoneration, Berhe provided the password for his e-mail and Facebook accounts; it was “Filmon,” the name of one of his friends in Khartoum. The prosecutors seized on this, remembering that Filmon was the name of the person identified in a wiretap of Mered’s brother Merhawi. The prosecution failed to note that Berhe has twelve Filmons among his Facebook friends; Mered has five Filmons among his. After the interrogation, the Palermo magistrate ordered a forensic analysis of Berhe’s phone and social-media accounts, to comb the data for inconsistencies. When officers ran everything through the Glauco database, they discovered that one of the scraps of paper submitted by the Sudanese authorities included the phone number of a man named Solomon, who in 2014 had spoken with Mered about hawala payments at least seventy-eight times. They also found that, although Berhe had said that he didn’t know Mered’s wife, Lidya Tesfu, he had once corresponded with her on Facebook. Tesfu told me that she and Berhe had never met. But he had thought that she looked attractive in pictures, and in 2015 he started flirting with her online. She told him that she was married, but he persisted, and so she shut him down, saying, “I don’t need anyone but my husband.” When the prosecutors filed this exchange into evidence, they omitted everything except Tesfu’s final message, creating the opposite impression—that she was married to Berhe and was pining for him. Like so many others in Khartoum, Berhe had hoped to make it to Europe. His Internet history included a YouTube video of migrants in the Sahara and a search about the conditions in the Mediterranean. The prosecutors treated this as further evidence that he was a smuggler. Worse, in a text message to his sister, he mentioned a man named Ermias; a smuggler of that name had launched the boat that sunk off the coast of Lampedusa. By the end of the interrogation, it hardly mattered whether the man in custody was Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe or Medhanie Yehdego Mered. Berhe was returned to his cell. “The important thing is the evidence, not the identity,” Ferrara told me. “It only matters that you can demonstrate that that evidence led to that person.” The N.C.A. removed from its Web site the announcement of Mered’s arrest. This was the first extradition following a fragile new anti-smuggling partnership between European and East African governments, known as the Khartoum Process. There have been no extraditions since. Within the Eritrean community, Estefanos told me, “everyone was, like, ‘What a lucky guy—we went through the Sahara and the Mediterranean, and this guy came by private airplane!’ Everybody thought he would be released in days.” Instead, the judge allowed Berhe’s case to proceed to trial. It was as if the only people who were unwilling to accept his innocence were those in control of his fate. Toward the end of the preliminary hearing, one of the prosecutors had asked Berhe if he had ever been to Libya. In the audio recording, he says “No.” But in the official transcript someone wrote “Yes.”

Tondo and Kingsley wrote in the Guardian that the trial “risks becoming a major embarrassment for both Italian and British police.” Tondo told me that, the night after the article’s publication, “I got a lot of calls from friends and family members. They were really worried about the consequences of the story.” Tondo’s livelihood relied largely on his relationship with officials at the magistrate’s office, many of whom frequently gave him confidential documents. “That’s something that began during the Mafia wars, when you could not really trust the lawyers who were defending mobsters,” he said. Tondo was thirty-four, with a wife and a two-year-old son; working as a freelancer for Italian and international publications, he rarely earned more than six hundred euros a month. “I survived through journalism awards,” he said. “So what the fuck am I going to do”—drop the story or follow where it led? “Every journalist in Sicily has asked that sort of question. You’re at the point of jeopardizing your career for finding the truth.” In Italy, investigative journalists are often wiretapped, followed, and intimidated by the authorities. “The investigative tools that prosecutors use to put pressure on journalists are the same ones that they use to track criminals,” Piero Messina, a Sicilian crime reporter, told me. Two years ago, Messina published a piece, in L’Espresso , alleging that a prominent doctor had made threatening remarks to a public official about the daughter of Paolo Borsellino, one of the anti-Mafia prosecutors who was killed in 1992. Messina was charged with libel, a crime that can carry a prison sentence of six years. According to the Italian press-freedom organization Ossigeno per l’Informazione, in the past five years Italian journalists have faced at least four hundred and thirty-two “specious defamation lawsuits” and an additional thirty-seven “specious lawsuits on the part of magistrates.” At a court hearing, Messina was presented with transcripts of his private phone calls. “When a journalist discovers that he’s under investigation in this way, he can’t work anymore” without compromising his sources, Messina told me. Police surveillance units sometimes park outside his house and monitor his movements. “They fucked my career,” he said. Messina’s trial is ongoing, and he is struggling to stay afloat. A few months ago, La Repubblica paid him seven euros for a twelve- hundred-word article on North Korean spies operating in Rome. “The pay is so low that it’s suicide to do investigative work,” he told me. “This is how information in Italy is being killed. You lose the aspiration to do your job. I know a lot of journalists who became chefs.” Prosecutors have wide latitude to investigate possible crimes, even if nothing has been reported to the police, and they are required to formally register an investigation only when they are ready to press charges. In a recent essay, Michele Caianiello, a criminal-law professor at the University of Bologna, wrote that the capacity to investigate people before any crime is discovered “makes it extremely complicated to check ex post facto if the prosecutor, negligently or maliciously, did not record in the register the name of the possible suspect”—meaning that, in practice, prosecutors can investigate their perceived opponents indefinitely, without telling anyone. In 2013, the Italian government requested telephone data from Vodafone more than six hundred thousand times. That year, Italian courts ordered almost half a million live interceptions. Although wiretaps are supposed to be approved by a judge, there are ways to circumvent the rules. One method is to include the unofficial target’s phone number in a large pool of numbers—perhaps a set of forty disposable phones that have suspected links to a Mafia boss. “It’s a legitimate investigation, but you throw in the number of someone who shouldn’t be in it,” an Italian police-intelligence official told me. “They do this all the time.” Tondo continued reporting on the Medhanie trial, embarrassing the prosecutors every few weeks with new stories showing that the wrong man might be in jail. At one of Berhe’s hearings, a man wearing a black jacket and hat followed Tondo around the courthouse, taking pictures of him with a cell phone. Tondo confronted the stranger, pulling out his own phone and photographing him in return, and was startled when the man addressed him by name. After the incident, Tondo drafted a formal complaint, but he was advised by a contact in the military police not to submit it; if he filed a request to know whether he was under investigation, the prosecutors would be notified of his inquiry but would almost certainly not have to respond to it. “In an organized-crime case, you can investigate completely secretly for years,” Ferrara told me. “You never inform them.” A few months later, the man with the black hat took the witness stand; he was an investigative police officer. “First, I’ll read the minutes from your last weddings.” Tondo makes a significant portion of his income working as a fixer for international publications. I met him last September, four months after Berhe’s arrest, when I hired him to help me with a story about underage Nigerian girls who are trafficked to Europe for sex work. We went to the Palermo magistrate to collect some documents on Nigerian crime, and entered the office of Maurizio Scalia, the deputy chief prosecutor. “Pardon me, Dr. Scalia,” Tondo said. He began to introduce me, but Scalia remained focussed on him. “You’ve got balls, coming in here,” he said. This spring, a Times reporter contacted Ferrara for a potential story about migration. Ferrara, who knew that she was working with Tondo on another story, threatened the paper, telling her, “If Lorenzo Tondo gets a byline with you, the New York Times is finished with the Palermo magistrate.” (Ferrara denies saying this.)

One afternoon in Palermo, I had lunch with Francesco Viviano, a sixty-eight-year-old Sicilian investigative reporter who says that he has been wiretapped, searched, or interrogated by the authorities “eighty or ninety times.” After decades of reporting on the ways in which the Mafia influences Sicilian life, Viviano has little patience for anti-Mafia crusaders who exploit the Cosa Nostra’s historic reputation in order to buoy their own. “The Mafia isn’t completely finished, but it has been destroyed,” he said. “It exists at around ten or twenty per cent of its former power. But if you ask the magistrates they say, ‘No, it’s at two hundred per cent,’ ” to frame the public perception of their work as heroic. He listed several public figures whose anti-Mafia stances disguised privately unscrupulous behavior. “They think they’re Falcone and Borsellino,” he said. In recent decades, Palermo’s anti-Mafia division has served as a pipeline to positions in Italian and European politics. In December, 2014, Sergio Lari, a magistrate from the Sicilian hill town of Caltanissetta, who had worked with Falcone and Borsellino and solved Borsellino’s murder, was nominated for the position of chief prosecutor in Palermo. But Francesco Lo Voi, a less experienced candidate, was named to the office. The following year, Lari began investigating a used-car dealership in southern Sicily. He discovered that its vehicles were coming from a dealership in Palermo that had been seized by the state for having links to the Mafia. Lari informed Lo Voi’s office, which started wiretapping the relevant suspects and learned that the scheme led back to a judge working inside the Palermo magistrate: Silvana Saguto, the head of the office for seized Mafia assets. “Judge Saguto was considered the Falcone for Mafia seizures,” Lari told me. “She was in all the papers. She stood out as a kind of heroine.” Lari’s team started wiretapping Saguto’s line. Saguto was tipped off, and she and her associates stopped talking on the phone. “At this point, I had to make a really painful decision,” Lari said. “I had to send in my guys in disguise, in the middle of the night, into the Palermo Palace of Justice, to bug the offices of magistrates. This was something that had never been done in Italy.” Lari and his team uncovered a vast corruption scheme, which resulted in at least twenty indictments. Among the suspects are five judges, an anti-Mafia prosecutor, and an officer in Italy’s Investigative Anti-Mafia Directorate. Saguto was charged with seizing businesses under dubious circumstances, appointing relatives to serve as administrators, and pocketing the businesses’ earnings or distributing them among colleagues, family, and friends. In one instance, according to Lari’s twelve-hundred-page indictment, Saguto used stolen Mafia assets to pay off her son’s professor to give him passing grades. (Saguto has denied all accusations; her lawyers have said that she has “never taken a euro.”) Lari refused to talk to me about other prosecutors in the Palermo magistrate’s office, but the police-intelligence official told me that “at least half of them can’t say they didn’t know” about the scheme. Lari said that Saguto was running “an anti-Mafia mafia” out of her office at the Palace of Justice. Except for Lari, every prosecutor who worked with Falcone and Borsellino has either retired or died. The Saguto investigation made Lari “many enemies” in Sicilian judicial and political circles, he said. “Before, the mafiosi hated me. Now it’s the anti-mafiosi. One day, you’ll find me dead in the street, and no one will tell you who did it.”

The investigations of the Palermo magistrate didn’t prevent its prosecutors from interfering with Calantropo’s preparations for Berhe’s defense. A week after the preliminary hearing, he applied for permission from a local prefecture to conduct interviews inside a migrant-reception center in the town of Siculiana, near Agrigento, where he hoped to find Eritreans who would testify that Berhe wasn’t Mered. Days later, Ferrara, Scalia, and Camilleri wrote a letter to the prefecture, instructing its officers to report back on whom Calantropo talked to. Calantropo, after hearing that the Eritreans had been moved to another camp, decided not to go. “It’s not legal for them to monitor the defense lawyer,” Calantropo said. “But if you observe his witnesses then you observe the lawyer.” Calantropo is calm and patient, but, like many Sicilians, he has become so cynical about institutional corruption and dubious judicial practices that he is sometimes inclined to read conspiracy into what may be coincidence. “I can’t be sure that they are investigating me,” he told me, raising an eyebrow and tilting his head in a cartoonish performance of skepticism. “But, I have to tell you, they’re not exactly leaving me alone to do my job.” Last summer, Meron Estefanos brought Yonas and another Eritrean refugee, named Ambes, from Sweden to Palermo. Both men had lived in Mered’s connection house in Tripoli in 2013. After they gave witness statements to Calantropo, saying that they had been smuggled by Mered and had never seen the man who was on trial, Tondo contacted Scalia and Ferrara. “I was begging them to meet our sources,” Tondo recalled. “But they told us, ‘We already got Mered. He’s in jail.’ ” (Estefanos, Calantropo, Yonas, and Ambes remember Tondo’s calls; Ferrara says that they didn’t happen.) Although Mered is reputed to have sent more than thirteen thousand Eritreans to Italy, the prosecutors seem to have made no real effort to speak with any of his clients. The Glauco investigations and prosecutions were carried out almost entirely by wiretapping calls, which allowed officials to build a web of remote contacts but provided almost no context or details about the suspects’ lives—especially the face-to-face transactions that largely make up the smuggling business. As a result, Ali, Mered’s Libyan boss, is hardly mentioned in the Glauco documents. When asked about him, Ferrara said that he didn’t know who he was. Ambes showed me a photograph that he had taken of Ali on his phone. After Yonas and Ambes returned to Sweden, the Palermo magistrate asked police to look into them. E.U. law requires that asylum claims be processed in the first country of entry, but after disembarking in Sicily both men had continued north, to Sweden, before giving their fingerprints and their names to the authorities. Investigating them had the effect of scaring off other Eritreans who might have come forward. “I don’t believe that they are out there to get the truth,” Estefanos said, of the Italian prosecutors. “They would rather prosecute an innocent person than admit that they were wrong.” Calantropo submitted into evidence Berhe’s baptism certificate, which he received from his family; photos of Berhe as a child; Berhe’s secondary-school report card; Berhe’s exam registration in seven subjects, with an attached photograph; and a scan of Berhe’s government-issued I.D. card. Berhe’s family members also submitted documents verifying their own identities. Other documents established Berhe’s whereabouts. His graduation bulletin shows that in 2010, while Mered was smuggling migrants through Sinai, he was completing his studies at a vocational school in Eritrea. An official form from the Ministry of Health says that in early 2013—while Mered was known to be in Libya—Berhe was treated for an injury he sustained in a “machine accident,” while working as a carpenter. The owner of Thomas Gezae Dairy Farming, in Asmara, wrote a letter attesting that, from May, 2013, until November, 2014—when Mered was running the connection house in Tripoli—Berhe was a manager of sales and distribution. Gezae wrote, “Our company wishes him good luck in his future endeavors.” Last fall, one of Berhe’s sisters travelled to the prison from Norway, where she has asylum, to visit him and introduce him to her newborn son. But she was denied entry. Only family members can visit inmates, and although her last name is also Berhe, the prison had him registered as Medhanie Yehdego Mered. “It’s not you, Adam. It’s men.” Last December, the government of Eritrea sent a letter to Calantropo, confirming that the man in custody was Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe. “It’s very strange that the European police never asked the Eritrean government for the identity card of Medhanie Yehdego Mered,” Calantropo said. (Ferrara said that Italy did not have a legal-assistance treaty with Eritrea.) When I asked Calantropo why he didn’t do that himself, he replied, “I represent Berhe. I can only ask on behalf of my client.” The prosecution has not produced a single witness who claims that Berhe is Mered. Instead, Ferrara has tried to prove that Mered uses numerous aliases, one of which may be Berhe. A few years ago, Ferrara turned a low-level Eritrean smuggler named Nuredine Atta into a state witness. After he agreed to testify, “we put him under protection, exactly like Mafia cases,” and reduced his sentence by half, Ferrara said. Long before Berhe’s arrest, Atta was shown the photograph of Medhanie Yehdego Mered wearing a cross. He said that he recalled seeing the man on a beach in Sicily in 2014, and that someone had told him that the man’s name was Habtega Ashgedom. In court, he couldn’t keep his story straight. In a separate smuggling investigation, prosecutors in Rome discounted Atta’s testimony about Mered as unreliable. After the extradition, Atta was shown a photo of Berhe. “I don’t recognize him,” he said. Later, on the witness stand, he testified that he was pretty sure he’d seen a photo of Berhe at a wedding in Khartoum, in 2013—contradicting Berhe’s claim that he had been selling milk in Asmara at the time. Berhe’s family, however, produced a marriage certificate and photographs, proving that the wedding had been in 2015, in keeping with the time line that Berhe had laid out. In court, Ferrara treated the fact that Atta didn’t know Mered or Berhe as a reason to believe that they might be the same person. Ferrara is also trying to link Berhe’s voice to wiretaps of Mered. The prosecution had Berhe read phrases transcribed from Mered’s calls, which they asked a forensic technician named Marco Zonaro to compare with the voice from the calls. Zonaro used software called Nuance Forensics 9.2. But, because it didn’t have settings for Tigrinya, he carried out the analysis with Egyptian Arabic, which uses a different alphabet and sounds nothing like Tigrinya. Zonaro wrote that Egyptian Arabic was “the closest geographical reference population” to Eritrea. The tests showed wildly inconsistent results. Zonaro missed several consecutive hearings; when he showed up, earlier this month, Ferrara pleaded with the judge to refer the case to a different court, meaning that Zonaro didn’t end up testifying, and that the trial will begin from scratch in September. Many of the wiretapped phone calls that were submitted into evidence raise questions about the limits of Italian jurisdiction. According to Gioacchino Genchi, one of Italy’s foremost experts on intercepted calls and data traffic, the technological options available to prosecutors far exceed the legal ones. When both callers are foreign and not on Italian soil, and they aren’t plotting crimes against Italy, the contents of the calls should not be used in court. “But in trafficking cases there are contradictory verdicts,” he said. “Most of the time, the defense lawyers don’t know how to handle it.” Genchi compared prosecutorial abuses of international wiretaps to fishing techniques. “When you use a trawling net, you catch everything,” including protected species, he said. “But, if the fish ends up in your net, you take it, you refrigerate it, and you eat it.”

On May 16th, having found the number and the address of Lidya Tesfu, Mered’s wife, in Italian court documents, I met her at a café in Sweden. She told me that she doesn’t know where her husband is, but he calls her once a month, from a blocked number. “He follows the case,” she said. “I keep telling him we have to stop this: ‘You have to contact the Italians.’ ” I asked Tesfu to urge her husband to speak with me. Earlier this month, he called. In the course of three hours, speaking through an interpreter, Mered detailed his activities, his business woes, and—with some careful omissions—his whereabouts during the past seven years. His version of events fits with what I learned about him from his former clients, from his wife, and from what was both present in and curiously missing from the Italian court documents—though he quibbled over details that hurt his pride (that Ali had slapped him) or could potentially hurt him legally (that he was ever armed). Mered told me that in December, 2015, he was jailed under a different name for using a forged Eritrean passport. He wouldn’t specify what country he was in, but his brother’s wiretapped call—the one that referred to Mered’s pending return from Dubai—suggests that he was probably caught in the United Arab Emirates. Six months later, when Berhe was arrested in Khartoum, Mered learned of his own supposed extradition to Italy from rumors circulating in prison. In August, 2016, one of Mered’s associates managed to spring him from jail, by presenting the authorities in that country with another fake passport, showing a different nationality—most likely Ugandan—and arranging Mered’s repatriation to his supposed country of origin. His time in prison explains why the Italian wiretaps on his Sudanese number picked up nothing in the months before Berhe was arrested; it also explains why, when the Italians asked Facebook to turn over Mered’s log-in data, there was a gap during that period."
http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/how-the-republican-effort-to-repeal-obamacare-came-crashing-down,newyorker,How the Republican Effort to Repeal Obamacare Came Crashing Down,[],"At about 1:40 on Friday morning, Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, stood behind a lectern in the U.S. Senate, his left hand in his pocket, and said, “So, Mr. President, this is clearly a disappointing moment.” A few minutes earlier, the Senate had narrowly voted down a so-called skinny-repeal bill , which was McConnell’s latest ploy to keep alive the Republican Party’s seven-and-a-half-year effort to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. The bill would have eliminated some parts of Obamacare, including the individual mandate. Perhaps more importantly, its passage would have tossed the ball to a House-Senate conference committee, where a more comprehensive demolition plan could have been worked up.

The historic vote was fifty-one to forty-nine against the bill, with three Republican senators joining the Democrats in opposing it. Two of the G.O.P. dissidents were Maine’s Susan Collins and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski. Both of them had bravely resisted their party’s previous efforts to pass damaging health-care bills. The other Republican no vote was cast by the cancer-stricken John McCain , of Arizona, who, in an astonishing piece of political drama, helped deliver a monumental blow to his party’s leadership and to President Trump, who once mocked and grievously insulted him.

Shortly before the vote was taken, C- SPAN ’s cameras showed McCain engaged in warm conversations with a group of Democrats. He also had some seemingly frostier exchanges with some of his Republican colleagues. At one point, McConnell walked by McCain and the two men appeared to ignore each other. Shortly before the vote, Vice-President Mike Pence—who was in the room to break a tie in case of a fifty-fifty vote—left the chamber. When the roll-call vote was taken and McCain’s name was called out, he gave a thumbs-down sign and said, “No.” Democrats cheered and applauded.

Skinny repeal had been McConnell’s fallback strategy: during the previous couple of weeks, the Senate had already rejected a bill that would have replaced Obamacare and another that would have repealed it without providing any replacement. On Friday morning, the Senate Majority Leader acknowledged that the jig was up. Referring to Democratic efforts to stymie the Republican repeal push, he said, “I regret to say they have succeeded in that effort. So, now I think it is appropriate to ask: What are their ideas? It will be interesting to see what they suggest as the way forward.”

McConnell posed the question more out of pique than because the spirit of coöperation had overcome him. But the fact is, he and other Republicans now have little choice but to engage in some sort of negotiation process with the Democrats. The G.O.P.’s signature policy initiative has collapsed under the weight of its own shortcomings and contradictions.

As McConnell indicated, the Senate Democrats, who stayed united under their leader, Chuck Schumer, deserve some of the credit for instigating this collapse. So do all the activists, protesters, and policy wonks who have spent much of the past six months working to frustrate the Republicans’ heartless and ill-considered designs. Also deserving credit are ordinary Americans, who, as the details of the various Republican proposals became clear, decided in very large numbers that they would be better off sticking with Obamacare, for all its problems.

But above all else, the collapse reflects a failure of the Republican Party and its President. Trump’s rise to power has undermined his party’s internal cohesion. And his ignorance of basic health-care-policy details hampered efforts to win over public support for the repeal effort. The G.O.P. is now a conservative political organization that favors small government and abhors the expansion of the welfare state, yet it has come to rely on the votes of less affluent white voters, many of whom depend on government programs—particularly Medicaid—that would have been slashed under the Party’s repeal plans.

As long as repealing Obamacare was merely a slogan used to rally disaffected voters, the G.O.P. leadership could afford to ignore this tension. But after a President from their own party was unexpectedly voted into the White House, Republicans were forced to put an actual policy proposal on the table. In the end, the tension was too difficult to resolve, even for McConnell, who employed secrecy, subterfuge, and clock-management to try to railroad any bill he could though the Senate. His office didn’t even publish the skinny-repeal bill until 10 P.M. on Thursday, just two hours before the vote was scheduled to take place.

As the senators prepared to cast their votes, most observers assumed that the bill would pass. With just forty-eight votes of their own, the Democrats didn’t have the numbers to stop it. Still, some of them did get the chance to state a few truths. “This is nuclear-grade bonkers, what is going on here tonight,” Chris Murphy, of Connecticut, said during the brief debate. “We are about to reorder one fifth of the American health-care system, and we are going to have two hours to review a bill … that is lighting the American health-care system on fire with intentionality.” “Why is this being run this way?” Schumer asked. ""Why is this being done in the dead of night. I can’t believe that my”—Republican—“colleagues are proud of this.” Cory Booker, of New Jersey, said, “This is not what the people want. This is a betrayal of our values. This is a betrayal of our history.”

The Republicans, for their part, appeared barely more enthusiastic about the contents of the bill, which the Party leadership openly presented as a ruse. “We intend to pass a bill and to conference with the House to make the bill better,” John Cornyn, the Majority Whip, said in closing the debate. According to an instant analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, the bill would have increased the number of uninsured by fifteen million over ten years and raised premiums by twenty per cent. “It is not perfect but it is better than the status quo,” Cornyn added.

Earlier in the day, some of Cornyn’s colleagues were highly critical of the proposal they were being asked to support. Four of them—McCain; Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina; Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana; and Ron Johnson, of Wisconsin—held a press conference at which they threatened to vote against the bill unless they received firm assurances that it wouldn’t become law. (Although this press conference took place before McConnell’s office published the bill, the major elements it would contain were already known.) “The skinny bill as policy is a disaster,” Graham said. “It is not a replacement in and of itself.”

A few hours later, Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House, issued a statement in which he confirmed that he was willing to set up a House-Senate conference committee to hash out a broader bill, which would then be sent back to the Senate. This satisfied three of the Republican doubters, who indicated that they would support McConnell’s measure. Shortly before 9 P.M. , however, McCain said that Ryan’s statement was “not sufficient,” thus raising the possibility that he would join with Collins and Murkowski to defeat the bill.

On Tuesday, McCain had returned to the Senate for the first time since being diagnosed with brain cancer, and he’d delivered a speech upbraiding his colleagues for acting out of partisanship. He called for a return to “regular order” and for coöperation with the other party. Yet despite the laudable rhetoric of this speech, McCain voted for a procedural motion that allowed McConnell to bring various Obamacare-repeal measures to a vote. Later in the week, he also voted for McConnell’s repeal-and-replace bill, which was drawn up in secrecy with very little consultation.

On Thursday, even after McCain said that he wasn’t satisfied with Ryan’s assurances, many observers assumed it was another head fake—that he would ultimately align himself with his party’s leadership. As he made his way toward the Senate chamber, a reporter asked him which way he would cast his vote. “Wait for the show,” he replied. It turned out to be worth waiting up for.

“I thought it was the right thing to do,” he told reporters as he left after the vote. A bit later, in a statement, he said, “We must now return to the correct way of legislating and send the bill back to committee, hold hearings, receive input from both sides of the aisle, heed the recommendations of the nation’s governors, and produce a bill that finally delivers affordable health care for the American people.”

To be sure, McCain’s statement didn’t address the many complexities of achieving the goal that he laid out. But it was his vote that mattered, not his words. Together with the votes cast by Collins and Murkowski—not to mention every Democrat in the Senate—it has hopefully killed the Republican Party’s misguided effort to destroy the A.C.A. and turn back history."
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1960/12/17/childrens-friend,newyorker,The World of Dr. Seuss,[],"The face of Theodor Seuss Geisel—an arresting one, with soft eyes and a long, beaky nose—is not nearly as familiar as that of Santa Claus, yet its owner is an equally formidable contender for the adulation of many children. Santa Claus brings them presents. Geisel makes them laugh, and, what is more, he’s real. Since 1936, under the alias of Dr. Seuss, Geisel, a plain and gentle man who is now fifty-six, has written and illustrated nineteen humorous books for children, all but three in galloping verse. Being shy, tense, and serious-minded, he tries to avoid the popping eyes and clutching hands of his disciples, but on the rare occasions when he is harried into making a personal appearance at an autographing bee, he attracts crowds that would cause a Western television hero to sway in the saddle with envy. There have been many attempts, some of them jocular, to define the age groups for which the Dr. Seuss books have the greatest appeal. Random House, which has published practically all of Geisel’s books, conservatively catalogues his works in the five-to-nine-year-old bracket. A Bowling Green, Kentucky, reviewer, however, once estimated the age of the audience for “How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” a Geisel variation on the theme of Scrooge, to range from two to ninety-two; a Houston, Texas, critic put it at three to ninety-three. And in Junior Reviewers, a seven-year-old junior reviewer wrote of “Scrambled Eggs Super!,” a Geisel variation on the theme of scrambled eggs, “All ages would like it from 6 to 44—that’s how old my mother is.” There has been a great deal thought, said, and written about the quality of contemporary children’s books, much of it in high-flown psychological and sociological jargon. Geisel’s own approach to the topic is down-to-earth. “If a book pleases me, it has a chance of pleasing children,” he says. Many of the elders whom he also pleases are faithful to him because they feel that they can read, and reread, and re-reread a Dr. Seuss book to a child without imperilling their own mental balance or—by skipping paragraphs or whole pages—impairing their integrity. This is not to say that Geisel has no detractors. There are those who think his pictures and words are plain silly—a few of the leaders of this faction would just as soon seek to divert their children with the exterior of a cereal box—but most guardians of the young mind, it would appear, are willing to go along with the Bulletin of the Parents League of New York, which has enthusiastically endorsed Geisel’s books. The League classifies them as “read-alouds.” He himself fancies the description “logical insanity.” The reading aloud of logical insanity, appropriately illustrated by its creator, has always been fun, but between Edward Lear’s day and Dr. Seuss’s the pickings, few people would deny, have been slim. Geisel and his wife, who under her maiden name of Helen Palmer is herself the author of several successful but more or less conventional children’s books—to name a few, “Tommy’s Wonderful Rides,” “Johnny’s Machines,” “Bobby and His Airplane,” and “Donald Duck Sees South America”—are childless. Some of their friends consider it a shame that a man who is so beloved by so many children has none of his own. Geisel does not agree. “You have ’em, I’ll amuse ’em,” he has said on more than one occasion, and he has also said, “You can’t write books for children if too many of them are looking over your shoulder.” With no children at all looking over his shoulder, Geisel painstakingly turns out books that, in the opinion of Rudolf Flesch, the “Why Johnny Can’t Read” man, will be read a hundred years hence, when, also in Flesch’s opinion, Hemingway, Faulkner, Marquand, and other current favorites may be gathering dust. Flesch rates Geisel “a genius pure and simple.” Bennett Cerf, the president of Random House, has stated that Geisel is the only genius on his list, though Cerf would probably not have put it so baldly had Faulkner, whom he also publishes, been in his office at the time. For the last few years, Geisel has been the best-selling author on the Random House list, and possibly on any list anywhere. Once or twice a year, the Times puts out a Sunday children’s-book supplement and includes a roster of best-sellers; in last month’s ratings three of the top four sellers were by Dr. Seuss. When Nevil Shute died, last January, his obituary in the Times proclaimed him the best-selling novelist of his day, adding that his yearly royalties amounted to a hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars. Geisel’s book royalties came to nearly two hundred thousand dollars in 1959. To date, nearly three million copies of Dr. Seuss’s books have been sold, and Random House now orders a first printing of a hundred thousand copies of any book that he writes. Even this figure proved inadequate for “Happy Birthday to You!,” which was issued in October, 1959; within a few weeks, stocks of the book were exhausted, and fifty thousand additional copies were run off. Geisel is staggered and a bit frightened by his opulence, for he has never learned to come to grips with money. Not quite trusting money, he hardly ever carries any, and he frequently grabs for restaurant checks only to discover that he can’t pay them. He gave up trying to cope with checkbooks some thirty years ago, and turned them over to his wife. “I wish people would stop talking to me about money,” he says. “All I want to do is to write books, and everybody’s forever nagging at me to keep them.” Geisel’s tastes are simple. “Ted has no extravagances,” his wife says. “I can’t think of anything he likes except cigarettes and rocks.” His cigarette outlay runs comparatively high. A chain smoker, he now and then breaks off for a while and sucks on an unlighted corncob pipe filled with radish seeds. Whenever a compulsion to smoke sweeps over him—which is every few minutes—he waters his seeds with an eyedropper. Once a crop of radish greens has sprouted from his pipe bowl—which he says takes about three days in a hospitable environment—he goes back to cigarettes. Rocks are his outdoor hobby. At his home, astride a hilltop in La Jolla, California, he is an earnest rock gardener, and Publishers’ Weekly is apt to be crowded off his parlor table by some lithic journal like Guide for Beginning Fossil Hunters . One of his most treasured possessions is a heavy stone slab with a dinosaur’s footprint in it, reputed to be something over a hundred and fifty million years old. Geisel himself is reputed to be something of a prankster, and, to his indignation, quite a few of his acquaintances refuse to believe that his hoary fossil is not homemade. La Jolla is an upper-bracket community, and the relative austerity of the Geisels’ way of life confounds their neighbors. Geisel and his wife have only one car, only one maid—part-time, at that—and only one swimming pool. After thirty-three years of married life, they are an uncommonly devoted couple, and they see no reason to have a second car, since they are rarely apart. Mrs. Geisel stopped writing books of her own fifteen years ago, so she could concentrate on helping her husband with his. This she does in part by keeping a vigilant critical eye on his output, in part by giving him the reassurance and praise for which he, like many another writer, has an insatiable need, and in part by shielding him from distractions. Along with his finances, she handles his correspondence. Geisel’s—or, rather, Dr. Seuss’s—mail is imposing. At the end of 1957, Random House announced that in the previous twelve months he had received nine thousand two hundred and sixty-seven pounds of it. No up-to-date statistics have been released, but whatever the avoirdupois of Geisel’s current mail, it amounts to thousands of letters a week. Geisel’s policy is to have his wife answer letters from teachers, librarians, sick or crippled children, and entire school classes. (Mrs. Geisel signs some of the replies “Mrs. Dr. Seuss.”) The rest of his fan mail hardly ever gets to La Jolla. It is mercifully intercepted and screened by Random House, which sends the bulk of his correspondents a printed form letter that he has written and illustrated. The form letter in use until just recently explained that Dr. Seuss’s mail service was unreliable, because he lived on a steep and inaccessible precipice and because his correspondence had to travel by Budget, an ungainly Seuss beast, driven by Nudget, a Seuss Budget-driver. Most children were satisfied with this reply, but now and then a persistent correspondent would grumble. “Did you get a letter from a girl named Olive or a boy named Bud?” an Oregon schoolchild wrote Dr. Seuss a year or so ago. “They are both in my classroom. Did you get their letter? I don’t think you did the way your roads are but they will write to you again and then are you going to write to them again about the Budget and the Nudget? I want a letter from you again but not about the Budget and Nudget again.” Geisel sought to curtail laments of this sort by fashioning a new illustrated form letter, which thanks the correspondent on behalf of Dr. Seuss himself and a friend—the Three-Muffed Apfel Moose.

It is only within the last couple of years that Geisel’s fan mail and sales figures have soared into the literary stratosphere. As recently as 1954, he asked his agent, Phyllis Jackson, of the Music Corporation of America, whether she thought he could count on five thousand dollars annually from book royalties in the foreseeable future. She said he could, and now he knows he can. Not only does he write a new book or two every year but the sales of each book on his back list grow larger every year. All his old books are current best-sellers. An early one, “The King’s Stilts,” which was published in 1939, sold 4,648 copies the first year. By 1941, its annual sales were down to 394. In 1958, the last year for which figures are obtainable, they were up to 11,037. “The King’s Stilts” has been a more sluggish mover than any other Dr. Seuss book; its cumulative sales have climbed nearly to the 75,000 mark. Another early Dr. Seuss, “Horton Hatches the Egg,” which has had total sales of more than 200,000 and is still briskly hatching profits, sold 5,801 copies in 1940, the year it came out. It, too, fell off—to 1,645 the following year. In 1958, it sold 27,463 copies. What appears to have given all the Dr. Seuss books their recent boost was the publication, in 1957, of “The Cat in the Hat,” which seems likely to achieve a total sale of a million copies by the end of this year. Since the book is priced at a dollar ninety-five, this would bring its retail gross to nearly two million dollars—equivalent to the gross on six million copies of a thirty-five-cent paperback. Only two works of fiction, “God’s Little Acre” and “Peyton Place,” have sold as well as that in paperback form. And “The Cat in the Hat” is aseptic. “The Cat in the Hat” evolved from a 1954 article in Life by John Hersey, who complained of the sorry state of children’s primers and suggested that someone like Dr. Seuss ought to give the kids a break by providing them with sprightlier fare. Among those who urged Geisel to accept this challenge was William Spaulding, then the textbook editor and now the president of Houghton Miffiin. Having long felt that the “See the red ball? The ball is red” school of literature left a good deal to be desired, Geisel did not need much prodding. He was somewhat taken aback to learn that a primer was supposed to have a severely limited vocabulary—a particularly inhibiting restriction for a writer whose métier is verse—but after a long struggle he came up with a book that had a plot, had humor, rhymed, and did it all on a vocabulary of only two hundred-odd words. Houghton Mifflin issued “The Cat in the Hat” as a textbook, and Random House as a trade book. Hersey called it a “gift to the art of reading” and a “harum-scarum masterpiece.” Curiously, the Random House edition, sold through bookstores, has far outdistanced the Houghton Mifflin one, sold through school channels; the explanation may be that some old-line educators have tended to be suspicious of a primer produced by a man who signs himself “Dr.” but has never written a doctoral dissertation, and that others have felt the teaching process is a solemn business, not to be interrupted by avoidable laughter. Geisel, being fond of both cats and children, was glad that he had been able to use the one species to edify the other. In real life he sometimes finds the relationship between animals and human beings cruelly bewildering—not long ago he rescued a mouse that was floundering in his pool, only to see it scamper straight into a mousetrap he had set in his garage—but in his books he manages to reconcile his innate kindheartedness with some of the nasty practices implicit in the survival of the fittest. When a situation in “McElligot’s Pool,” for instance, seemed to call for a picture of a worm on a hook, Geisel made it graphically clear that his worm was not skewered on his barb but instead had curled itself up there cozily. At the moment, the Geisels, who once kept twenty-five or thirty cats, have only one pet—an aging, wheezy Irish setter. Their home, though, is filled with Dr. Seuss animals—painted, carved into chair backs and chests of drawers, or sculptured by him out of any old objects that have come to hand, like shaving brushes—as well as with store-bought toy animals collected by his wife. As a wedding-anniversary present one year, she gave her husband a delicate life-size model of a cockroach. Geisel was touched, but professionally he shuns any animal that looks normal. The animals that Geisel confects are anatomically absurd, as flexible and floppy-looking as rag dolls—or, indeed, as many children wish real pets were. “My animals look the way they do because I’ve never learned to draw,” he explains. He does, in fact, draw very much like an untutored child; first he makes an outline of the creature he has in mind, and then he fills in the enclosed area with solid colors. In 1954, he appeared on a children’s television program called “Excursion,” in the course of which he attempted to demonstrate how different the same animal could look to different artists by having six young abstract painters render their impressions of a horse. Geisel did not enter this sweepstakes himself, but he commented sympathetically on the utterly dissimilar, and universally unnaturalistic, results. In private, Geisel is less indulgent toward much contemporary art. To spoof a friend who had pretensions as a collector, he once told him at length about a nonexistent abstract painter called Escorobus. “I have some of his finest works at home,” Geisel said, “and he’s given me permission to act as his agent in selling them.” Then he went home and dashed off a wallful of Escorobuses. The friend came around to see them, and was reaching for his checkbook when Geisel owned up to the hoax. “That experience made me suspect that a lot of modern art is malarkey,” Geisel says. “If I can do it myself, it can’t be any good.”

Geisel’s father, Theodore Robert Geisel, is superintendent of the Springfield, Massachusetts, public-park system, and since his dominion includes a zoo, it is sometimes thought that his son’s predilection for animals—one of Dr. Seuss’s best-sellers is “If I Ran the Zoo”—is traceable back to boyhood. But the elder Geisel—a vigorous, ramrod-straight, silver-haired man of eighty-three—did not start running his zoo until his son had grown up; before that, he ran a Springfield brewery that his father had founded. (The brewery’s original name was Kuhlmbach & Geisel, which in Springfield taverns was traditionally amended to “Come back and guzzle.”) The younger Theodor was born on March 2, 1904. His forebears on both sides were German—his mother, Henrietta Seuss, who died in 1928, was the daughter of a Springfield baker—and he was raised in a Turnverein and Schützverein atmosphere. His father was an international rifle champion, and his mother was a crack shot, too; he is not. During the First World War, the Geisels, although they were by then pretty well Americanized and vociferously loyal, felt uneasy. Germans, brewers, marksmen—who wouldn’t? Geisel attributes much of his present diffidence to an incident that took place when the Springfield Boy Scouts, himself among them, were competitively peddling thrift stamps and Liberty Bonds. His grandfather Geisel was so doggedly openhanded a customer that young Ted compiled the second-best sales record in town. The day came when the leading salesboys were to be awarded medals, and Theodore Roosevelt arrived in Springfield to do the honors. “We all put on our Scout uniforms and marched to City Hall,” Geisel recalls, “and after Roosevelt had given a fiery speech, we lined up onstage to be decorated. But somebody had made a mistake, and there were ten boys and only nine medals. I happened to be tenth in line. When I stepped forward, with my whole family sitting proudly in the audience, all ready to applaud, Roosevelt had nothing to pin on me. He just stood there, nonplussed. Then a Scoutmaster ran up and said there had been a misunderstanding, and shoved me off the stage. I’ve had a dread of platform appearances ever since. After finishing public high school in Springfield, Geisel entered Dartmouth with the class of 1925, which the present vice-president of the college has hailed—in no small measure because Dr. Seuss belongs to it—as Dartmouth’s greatest class ever. (Some members of the class of ’26 insist that they have a matching claim to fame, because their ranks include the composer of “Rudolph, the Red-nosed Reindeer.”) Geisel became editor of the college humor magazine, the Jack-o-Lantern , to which he contributed reams of cartoons, many of them involving bizarre animals. It was standard undergraduate fare; one cartoon, captioned “Financial Note: Goat Milk Is Higher Than Ever,” showed a female mountain goat with her forefeet and her hind feet on two uneven peaks, which raised her udder above her head. Geisel’s editorship of the magazine gave him the status of a big man on campus, and he has been a big man there ever since. He has even judged a beauty-queen contest at the Dartmouth Winter Carnival. Whenever the Geisels come East nowadays, they try to fit in a visit to Dartmouth. The college library has a complete set of Dr. Seuss’s works, and now and then, in an avuncular mood, it puts them on display. In the archives of the library are manuscripts by Sinclair Lewis, Booth Tarkington, and Robert Frost, and also the manuscript of Dr. Seuss’s “The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins.” In 1955, Dartmouth legitimized Dr. Seuss’s title by making Geisel an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters. His citation, composed by the president of the college, Dr. John S. Dickey, read, in part, “You singlehandedly have stood as St. George between a generation of exhausted parents and the demon dragon of unexhausted children on a rainy day.” Dartmouth’s affection for Geisel ’25 has been handsomely reciprocated by his for his alma mater. When he was asked to contribute to a building-fund drive a few years ago, he replied offhandedly that he was leaving Dartmouth a little something in his will. The little something proved to be the copyrights on most of his books. The income from a couple of others is earmarked, through a foundation the Geisels have established, for the San Diego Fine Arts Gallery, of which he is a trustee. But Dartmouth will inherit a large portion of his royalties, and its share of them, twenty or thirty years hence, may very well amount to a quarter of a million dollars a year—the equivalent in income of a six-million-dollar endowment. Dartmouth’s promised legacy was endangered in the summer of 1958, when the Geisels paid an off-season visit to Hanover. Some faculty members who were there cooked up a surprise for Geisel. They had eighty children dress up as characters from his books and serenade him one morning, following which he was dragged onto the folded-down top of an ancient Packard phaeton and driven four times around the campus, while sticky- fingered urchins swarmed lovingly all over him. Geisel, though aware that this accolade had sprung from the best of intentions, was so shaken by it that he was tempted to call his lawyer and have his will redrawn. But he soon calmed down, and now he is as true-blue, or true-green, as ever. “Dartmouth will always be Number One for me,” he has since said. On receiving his bachelor’s degree, Geisel thought he might like to go into teaching. He had somehow given his father the impression that he was in line for a fellowship in English literature at Oxford, and Geisel père had elatedly spread word of this around Springfield. Nothing of the sort came to pass, so Mr. Geisel offered to stake his son to a graduate course at Oxford anyway. Arriving at Lincoln College, young Geisel was miserable. The weather was dank, and, what was worse, he quickly decided that by comparison with his fellow-matriculants he was appallingly ignorant. Helen Palmer, a Wellesley graduate, had entered Oxford a year before him, and she, too, was in the dumps. An American Rhodes Scholar there, Joseph Sagmaster, who knew and pitied both of them, thought that misery deserved company, and introduced them in his rooms one afternoon over anchovy toast. Students at Oxford weren’t allowed motorcycles, but Geisel acquired one anyway. In the hope of avoiding detection, he passed himself off as a poultrymonger, a disguise he effected by always carrying two plucked ducks in a basket wired to his vehicle. Geisel proposed to Miss Palmer while they were both aboard this sputtering prop, and at the instant of her consent the machine went out of control and hurled them into a ditch. They were superficially bruised, but they were engaged. In the judgment of Sagmaster, who became an editorial writer in Cincinnati, and to whose family Dr. Seuss’s “Yertle the Turtle” has been appreciatively dedicated, bringing the Geisels together was “the happiest inspiration I’ve ever had.” The Geisels, who do a lot of travelling, still nostalgically go back to Oxford every so often. When Mrs. Geisel was a student there, she lived in a boarding house and bathed in a tub under a window that she could not, and her landlady would not, close. Thirty years later, the Geisels were in London, and he suggested impulsively one morning, “Let’s go up to Oxford and see if that window is still open.” They took the next train, found that it was, and took the next train back. Geisel’s friends at Oxford were aware that he much preferred drawing pictures to mastering the prescribed curriculum. Miss Palmer kept urging him to give up the academic life for the artistic, but he hesitated. He had already had one galling rebuff. The Oxford University Press had responded with dismaying chilliness to his proposal that he illustrate, and it publish, a new edition of “Paradise Lost.” (It was his plan—and this alone may well have prompted the rejection—to show the Archangel Uriel sliding down a sunbeam with a long-necked oilcan in his hand, to slick his passage.) Geisel got even by leaving Oxford after one year and going to the University of Vienna, where he thought he might have a fling at studying nineteenth-century German drama. He couldn’t find anyone there who taught it, so he backtracked to the Sorbonne, where he called on a Jonathan Swift specialist whose name had been given him by an Oxford don. The Swift man welcomed him warmly and outlined what he thought was a bang-up subject for a doctoral thesis. His notion was that Geisel should explore the only period of Swift’s life, barring infancy, when he was not known to have written a single word—a stretch of several months in his teens. Though flattered at being thought capable of handling this scholarly opportunity, Geisel regarded it as depressingly negative in scope, and forthwith abandoned formal education for good. He took a cattle boat to Corsica, where he wrote a novel that has never been published, and then went to Italy. In November, 1927, he came home and married Miss Palmer, in New Jersey. The Geisels had decided to get married on the strength of his having sold a couple of cartoons to Judge. He signed them “Dr. Seuss,” feeling that he should save his patronym for more exalted artistic accomplishments and throwing in the title to give flair to the pseudonym. Over the next few years, he turned out a stream of cartoons and prose for Judge and for such other magazines as College Humor , Liberty , Vanity Fair, and the old Life . He made enough money to live in a Park Avenue apartment, where he produced, gratis, some of his most imaginative drawings for the customers of a neighborhood fish market that had a phone number differing from his by just one digit. On receiving a telephoned order for, say, two pounds of haddock, Geisel would obligingly draw a two-pound haddock, or what seemed to him a two-pound haddock, on an old shirt cardboard, and send it around to the customer. For Judge , one week, Geisel did a cartoon showing a huge beast nuzzling a bed on which lay a knight in armor. The caption went, “Mediaeval tenant: ‘Darn it all, another Dragon. And just after I’d sprayed the whole castle with Flit!’ ” A toss of a coin had impelled Geisel to make it Flit instead of FlyTox, another insecticide of the day, and it was a lucky toss, for the wife of a Flit advertising man picked up a copy of that Judge in a beauty parlor, and the next thing Geisel knew, he was under contract to do Flit ads. The famous “Quick, Henry! The Flit!” was the outcome. Actually, Geisel’s line for the first ad was “Quick, Mama! The Flit!,” and it accompanied a drawing of a cave boy clutched in a dinosaur’s jaws. Geisel did cartoons for Flit for seventeen years, varying his basic caption only occasionally, for the purpose of having, say, a bug-beset whale cry to a passenger in its jaws, “Quick, Jonah! The Flit!” The firm that made Flit was a subsidiary of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey (the only cartoon-ad idea that did not originate with Geisel or his wife was submitted by the first Mrs. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and while he can’t remember what it was, he recalls that it was droll), and every now and then he would be farmed out to another subsidiary, like the Essomarine fuel outfit. In this connection, he presided over a celebrated publicity stunt of the thirties—the Seuss Navy. The idea was spawned at the 1936 Motor Boat Show, and enrollment in the Navy was at first limited to owners of boats with inboard motors. Later, gossip columnists got in, some of them landlubbers. Every member was an admiral except Dr. Seuss, who was Admiral-in-Chief, and by 1940, when his Navy no longer seemed quite so funny, and petered out, it boasted a couple of thousand admirals. Its burgee was a Geisel-designed herring, mostly bones, and its official seal was a flippered seal. Annually, at Motor Boat Show time, Essomarine picked up the tab for a Seuss Navy banquet, attended by nearly a thousand admirals, whom Geisel would sonorously lead in an oath of allegiance to Mother Neptune—a mermaidlike creature he had rigged up out of a dressmaker’s dummy and a fishtail. “The Seuss Navy was a rather corny outfit,” Geisel says now. Geisel has toiled on many advertising campaigns over the years. For another Standard Oil offshoot, he created a series of bloodcurdling, or engine-curdling, monsters who roamed the nation’s billboards—the Moto-Raspus, the Zerodoccus, the Moto-Munchus, the Karbo-Nockus, and the Oilio-Gobelus. Geisel did his last billboard job in 1956. In that year, the La Jolla Town Council—of which he was, and still is, an active and conscientious member—issued a pamphlet, written and illustrated by Dr. Seuss, that merrily lambasted all billboards. It was an account of the rivalry of two Neanderthal business establishments—Guss’s Guss-ma-Tuss and Zaxx’s Zaxx-ma-Taxx—and it concluded with these lines: And, thus between them, with impunity They loused up the entire community. Sign after sign, after sign, until Their property values slumped to nil. And even the dinosaurs moved away From that messed-up spot in the U.S.A. Which is why our businessmen never shall Allow such to happen in La Jolla, Cal. On reading this, Geisel’s current billboard sponsor abruptly terminated his contract.

Geisel frequently says that his life has been a series of accidents, and it was pretty much accidental that he began writing books in the first place. Back in 1931, during his Judge and Esso days, the Viking Press asked him to illustrate, for a modest flat fee, a collection of schoolboys’ howlers that was to be brought out under the title “Boners.” The book and a sequel, “More Boners,” did very well, and Geisel looked on with envy as the author’s royalties piled up. “I suddenly realized there was no sense in just illustrating books,” he says. The following year, he wrote an ABC book, which consisted mainly of pictures of wacky animals of the kind that populate most of his books—a long-necked whizzleworp, for example, and a green-striped cholmondelet. Nobody was interested in publishing the book, but Dartmouth consolingly exhibited the manuscript. “The idea is obviously an excellent one,” an undergraduate critic commented in a campus publication, “but if juvenile impressions are as important as the child psychologists say they are, it is interesting to consider the strange new neuroses which such pictures could bring about.” Geisel shied away from trying another children’s book for four rears. Then, in 1936, while returning from a European trip, he became mesmerized, as he tells the tale, by the rhythm of the ship’s engines. “Da da da da de dum dum de da de de da ,” it went. To be sure, he could have come up with the identical rhythm merely by reciting “ ’Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house,” but one cannot anticipate inspiration. The words that seemed to him to fit his magic metre most neatly were “And to think that I saw it on Mulberry Street,” and within a few months he had written and illustrated a book with that title. A score of publishers rejected it. Then, one morning, while walking, manuscript in hand, along Madison Avenue, a byway to which his advertising stints often summoned him, he bumped into a Dartmouth contemporary, Marshall McClintock, who the day before had given the class of ’26 an upward nudge by becoming juvenile editor of the Vanguard Press, and who was aprowl for something to edit. Never did supply and demand more fortuitously collide. “Mulberry Street” has to do with a boy named Marco who, on the way home from school, sees an ordinary horse and wagon and progressively enlarges his recollection of them until his fancy has soared to rarefied descriptive heights. The book has gone through fifteen editions, totalling a hundred and twenty thousand copies; it has been read or dramatized on radio more than a hundred times; and it has been used in a fiction-writing course at N.Y.U. to illustrate what the instructor in charge called “the principle of intensification.” Deems Taylor based what he called “a set of variations for orchestra” on it, and in 1943 the New York Philharmonic played the piece at Carnegie Hall. Since “Mulberry Street,” Geisel has had just about every triumph conceivable for a writer of children’s books except one—he is largely without honor outside of his own country. It may have been easy for Deems Taylor to convert “Mulberry Street” into music, but there have been obvious difficulties in translating the bulk of Dr. Seuss’s work—most of which not only rhymes but deals with creatures called Nizzards, Ziffs, Zuffs, and Ham-ikka-Schnim-ikka-Schnam-ikka-Schnopps—into foreign languages. In Polish, for instance, a cat in a hat becomes a kot w kapeluszu , and a drum-tummied snumm a brzuchaty snumm —there evidently being no Polish word for “snumm.” In “The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins,” Geisel, who likes hats and once collected them, had some magicians chanting, “Winkibus, Tinkibus, Fotichee, Klay! Hat on this demon’s head, fly far away!” The Japanese translation of this book omitted the passage entirely. In Germany, a translator came up with “ Winkibus, Pinkibus, Lupf um die Eck. Hut von dem Hexerich, Fliege weit weg! ” The chant hasn’t yet been tried in Poland. A few Dr. Seuss books have been published in England, but they haven’t done especially well there. One reason may be the British have no word for “snumm,” either.

Geisel is a high-principled man, and most of his books have a moral—usually served up, like children’s medicine, in mild and palatable doses. In his books, might never makes right, the meek inherit the earth, and pride frequently goeth before a fall—usually a pratfall. When his “Horton Hears a Who!” came out, in 1954, the Times called it “probably the most moral tale since the first ‘Elsie Dinsmore,’ ” and the Des Moines Register characterized it as “a rhymed lesson in protection of minorities and their rights.” The hero, Horton, is an elephant who takes it upon himself, in the face of considerable scoffing, to champion the cause of a colony of Whos, microscopic creatures who inhabit a grain of dust. “A person’s a person, no matter how small,” Horton declares. In 1940, Geisel was working on an earlier Horton book, “Horton Hatches the Egg” (in this one Horton dutifully sits on an abandoned egg in a bird’s nest until, as a reward for his patience, he hatches a winged infant with the head of an elephant), when Paris fell to the Nazis. With Europe in turmoil and this country, to Geisel’s way of thinking, misguidedly complacent, he could not stick to the writing of children’s books, and instead began drawing cartoons that hit out at American isolationists. He was unable to find any newspaper publisher who felt that his political views needed airing until he ran into Virginia Vanderlip Schoales, an old friend, who was working on PM . Mrs. Schoales introduced him to Ralph Ingersoll, the editor of the paper, and Geisel at once became PM’s editorial cartoonist. While PM’s stated philosophy—that it was against people who pushed other people around—tied in very aptly with Horton’s view that a person’s a person regardless of size, some of Geisel’s friends, aware that he was then living on Park Avenue and that his major patron was Standard Oil, thought Ingersoll’s up-the-rebels journal an odd haven for him to have sailed into. (Actually, he was a no more incongruous figure there than Ingersoll himself, whose blood is very blue, or than Mrs. Schoales, the daughter of a bank president and the wife of a Morgan Stanley partner.) Geisel’s contributions to PM , like nearly everything else in that now defunct paper, were dead serious. He portrayed Pierre Laval as a louse on Hitler’s finger, and, for once drawing a reasonably recognizable animal, the archetypal Nazi as a particularly close-to-the-ground dachshund. This provoked so many protests from hundred-per-cent-American dachshund fanciers that he resolved never again to compete, artistically, with photographers and taxidermists. He depicted the America First Committee and the Nazi Party as Siamese twins linked by a straggly beard. This provoked some threats of a boycott against Standard Oil by a few irate isolationist customers, who thought the company’s right-hand advertising man was straying too far left. Geisel did three cartoons a week for PM and occasional drawings for the Treasury Department, the War Production Board, and Nelson Rockefeller’s Committee on Inter-American Affairs, but after the United States got into the war, he felt so out of the main current of events that at the end of 1942 he decided to join the armed forces. He was presently stationed in California, as an Army captain attached to Frank Capra’s celebrated wartime documentary-film-making unit, for which he wrote and directed scripts calculated to elevate G.I. morals and morale. In the fall of 1944, Geisel was shipped to Europe for a spell, in connection with his film work, and at General Omar Bradley’s headquarters in Luxembourg, he ran into Ingersoll, by then a lieutenant colonel. Ingersoll said he supposed that Geisel, like most Stateside tourists, would like to have a peek at some actual fighting while he was in the area—without, of course, getting too dangerously exposed. Unfolding a top-secret map, he studied it carefully and circled “Bastogne.” Then he summoned a jeep and urged Geisel to ride on up there and take in the sights. Geisel was trapped for three days in the Battle of the Bulge, eventually being rescued by the British. “Nobody came along and put up a sign saying, ‘This is the Battle of the Bulge,’ ” he explained later. “How was I supposed to know? I thought the fact that we didn’t seem to be able to find any friendly troops in any direction was just one of the normal occurrences of combat.” After Allied soldiers crossed the Rhine, Geisel had the task of lugging around an indoctrination film he’d worked on for future American occupation troops, with instructions to show it to generals in the field and obtain their imprimatur. The picture was a strong sermon against fraternization, and one point it kept hammering home was that in no circumstances should an American military man shake the hand of a German. (The ending of the finished product was somewhat tamer than the one Geisel had proposed, in which he had a Was Department narrator saying, “Just be a good soldier. Leave all the bungling to the State Department.”) One Army headquarters at which he paused with his can of anti-handshake film was in a captured German city, and he was invited to accompany some staff officers to a municipal reception. Geisel, by then a major, was under orders not to let the film out of his sight, and he dutifully carried it to the party, where he shortly found himself at the tail end of a line of officers being greeted, with ceremonious handshake, by their German hosts. As he moved forward, he ruefully shifted his burden from his right hand to his left so that he could follow the leader. Shortly before the first atomic bomb was exploded, Geisel returned to California, where he was ordered to come up with another film for postwar occupation troops—one that would keep them on the alert by reminding them that inattention could lead to a third world war. “Make that third war a real doozy, Geisel,” he was told. Seeking inspiration, he leafed through the magazine section of a recent Sunday Times , where his eye was caught by an article suggesting that there was enough latent energy in a tumbler of water, if man could ever figure out a way of harnessing it, to blow up half the earth. Without further ado, or further research, Geisel knocked out the draft of a script suggesting the possibility of unimaginably devastating explosions, and passed it along to his superiors. Two days later, the Pentagon was on the phone, urgently asking where he’d got his facts. “From the Times ,” he replied. “Burn your source of information, Geisel,” came the command. “Burn the Times ?” he asked. “Yes, and report by phone as soon as you’ve carried out your orders,” he was told. “I had long since thrown away the copy of the paper in question,” Geisel recalls, “but I wanted to be a good soldier, so I rushed my most reliable sergeant to an out-of-town news dealer, and he bought me a copy of the latest Times . We put it in a metal bucket and all marched out into a courtyard and stood in formation and gave the Boy Scout salute while a trusted lieutenant lit a match to it. Then I called Washington and said, ‘Mission accomplished, sir. We have burned the Times .’ ‘Well done, Geisel,’ I was told, and then they went on with the war.”

Mustered out, as a lieutenant colonel, early in 1946, Geisel proceeded to divide his time for several years between children’s books and motion pictures. With his wife, he wrote a documentary film about Japan, “Design for Death,” which won an Oscar in 1947, but which soured its authors on Hollywood values. The object of the picture was to show that the Japanese were at heart not much different from any other human beings (“A person’s a person, no matter how small”), and that they had allowed themselves to be dominated by a gang of ruthless leaders. One sequence, of which both Geisels were particularly fond, as illustrative of the serenity of Japanese culture, was devoted to sixteenth-century Japan. No actors were involved—just fog and water, with a muted tone poem as the musical background. While looking at some rushes one evening, the Geisels were horrified to discover that one of the producers had livened up this tranquil stretch with shots of American tanks barrelling through a crowd of shrieking Japanese. The producer refused to delete the tanks, on the ground that, anachronism or no anachronism, they gave the dreary old century some vitality. Just before the picture was released, the Geisels sneaked into a cutting room and, abetted by a film editor, snipped out the lively footage. The producer had the last word, though. Weeks later, when the Geisels passed a theatre where the film was playing, they found it advertised with posters that showed terrified white women in ripped chemises being carted off in cages by transparently ill-intentioned Japanese soldiers. On his own, Geisel invented the movie-cartoon character Gerald McBoing-Boing, whose adventures also won an Oscar, and he not only conceived but wrote the scenario and designed the sets and costumes for a full-length screen musical with live actors, called “The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.” This was a fantasy about a whipcracking music teacher, Dr. Terwilliker, who made five hundred boys practice their scales simultaneously day in and out at the keyboard of an enormous piano. Geisel wrote the words of twenty songs for the picture, too. Most of them were never used. One that was, “Ten Happy Fingers,” was supposed to be a satire on conventional piano exercises. The lyricist was bemused when a sheet-music publisher later brought it out as a conventional piano exercise. A hundred more or less piano-playing boys were hired for the movie, and Geisel has vivid memories of this group in action. “The kids were paid in cash,” he says, “and one day, during a violent rainstorm that flooded the studio, they descended on the commissary en masse. They all rapidly got sick on candy. It was like a nightmarish Noah’s Ark. Water was pouring in on the set, and the boys were moaning, and their mothers and their music teachers were all hopping up and down, and their ordinary teachers were running around trying to organize arithmetic classes, because the law said they should, and we had to call off work for three days and take the director to a hospital. It was the damnedest, nerve-rackingest, screamingest experience of my life.” Upon learning that a movie theatre in San Diego was holding the West Coast première of the picture and, as a special honor to him, was featuring his name on its marquee, Geisel became so edgy that he grabbed his wife and fled to Japan, explaining over his shoulder that he had some blocked yen in royalties that he wanted to spend. (The royalties, unsurprisingly, amounted to twenty-seven dollars and fifty cents.) He hasn’t seen the finished movie yet, he says, and he has never again worked for motion pictures. The Geisels had become addicted to California, though, if not to the movies. In 1948, they settled in La Jolla, a town of twenty thousand that was put on the map by the late E. W. Scripps. Among various La Jolla landmarks that the publisher endowed is the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, on whose staff is a Ph.D. named Hans Suess. He sometimes receives requests from first-grade teachers that have been addressed simply “Dr. Seuss, La Jolla,” and Geisel, in turn, receives requests from bathyorographically oriented professors. La Jolla is both a summer resort and a year-round haven for the retired, most of whom know their literary neighbor and are proud of him. La Jolla has four bookstores, and nearly every day one or another of them sends Geisel a batch of his books to be autographed for its customers. Many persons who spend vacations at La Jolla, moreover, order their Dr. Seuss books from La Jolla stores all the year round, to get them inscribed. During a couple of weeks last December, Geisel autographed a hundred and fifty Christmas-gift books a day. The highest spot in La Jolla is Mount Soledad, and it is on its summit that the Geisels live, in a pink stucco house they built around an observation tower, from which they can look out across the Pacific or down into Mexico. The tower was erected many years ago by a real-estate man, who used it to point out low-lying sites to prospects. When the Geisels bought the place, a lot of La Jollans were surprised; they had always believed that the tower, a favorite aerie for young couples, was municipally owned. When the Geisels moved in, they found the walls and beams of its topmost room covered with heart-framed initials and other romantic graffiti, many of them scribbled in lipstick, and Geisel insists that he removed five thousand empty beer cans from one of the closets. During the first few months after the Geisels took possession, sailors from the San Diego naval base and their girls would roll up to the house and head happily for the tower stairs. Even today, an occasional married couple who became engaged at the summit stop by to ask if they may make an anniversary visit to their former trysting place. The Geisels are also beleaguered by visitors who want to enjoy a view of Dr. Seuss. “It sometimes seems to me that half the teachers and librarians in America come to La Jolla for their holidays,” Geisel said wearily one evening last summer. He likes to work at night and sleep late, but for a while he was aroused at seven o’clock every Sunday morning by an idolatrous neighboring pack of Cub Scouts, who would hike across a ravine or two and ring his doorbell. “I would stagger downstairs and let them in,” Geisel says, “and the chief, or whatever he was, would announce cheerfully, ‘Well, here we are!’ Then they’d all march inside and sit down. I would be too groggy to say anything, and they would be too winded. One morning, we all sat and stared at each other for five minutes without exchanging a word, and finally one eight-year-old piped up, ‘We saw a snake on the way over.’ Then we all sat for another five minutes, until Helen rescued me by handing out cookies and easing them out. Eventually, I got them to quit through a friend who knew a cousin of a Scoutmaster.” Notwithstanding such impressive demonstrations of popularity, Geisel still finds it hard to believe in his own renown. A few months ago, he tried unavailingly, through somebody else’s cousin, to wangle an introduction to an eminent dowager he had admired from afar; he ultimately met her after she had stood in line for an hour at a bookstore autographing session, holding a copy of a book of his that she wanted inscribed for a grandchild. In 1956, some of the illustrations for his books were exhibited at the San Diego Fine Arts Gallery. Just before the opening night, Geisel expressed grave doubts about whether anyone would show up. When he himself did, he was instantly pounced on by a mob of three or four hundred children and parents, who pinned him against a wall and kept him at bay for more than an hour. As a trustee of the gallery, Geisel is busy these days helping map plans for a children’s wing to be added to it, which the museum hopes to call the Dr. Seuss Wing. Five years ago, he wrote and acted in an “Omnibus” television show devoted to an imaginary Seuss Museum. It differed from the general run of museums in that children going through it were not forbidden to touch the displays; on the contrary, the exhibits were all marked “Do Touch.” Geisel, who dedicated “Happy Birthday to You!” to “my good friends, the Children of San Diego County,” hopes that the new museum, toward which he has contributed substantially, will carry out this idea, at least to a degree. “I want a museum that will have a real, operable printing press alongside a shelf of books, and blocks of wood and chisels alongside woodcuts, so that children can watch and work at the same time,” he says. “I want every kid in San Diego to be able to blow a glass bottle while looking at some Venetian glass, and to make a tapestry in front of a Gobelin.” Geisel used to do most of his writing and drawing in any corner of his house that happened to be reasonably uncluttered. A few years ago, Ray Freiman, the production manager at Random House, told him he really ought to provide himself with, and certainly could afford, a permanent and comfortable studio. Geisel obediently built a spacious atelier on the Pacific side of his tower. The room has cork walls, on which he can tack the illustrations for a work in progress. His desk, which is littered with cans and jars of brushes and pens, seems to indicate that he regards himself as artist first and writer second, for it is a drafting table, with a sloping work surface; he keeps his typewriter on top of it, and types at a tilt. Ideas come hard to Geisel, and their implementation is a drawn-out, painful process. Once, he says, he chanced to sketch an elephant on an old pad of tracing paper. Afterward, he saw that he had superimposed the animal on a previously doodled tree in such a manner as to make the elephant seem perched in it. “I stopped, dumbfounded,” he says. “I said to myself, ‘That’s a hell of a situation. An elephant in a tree! What’s he doing there?’ I brooded over it for three or four weeks, and finally I said to myself, ‘Of course! He’s hatching an egg!’ ” This is his conscious recollection of the genesis of “Horton Hatches the Egg,” but his subconscious might demur, since he had done a cartoon for Judge , years before, showing a whale in a tree. Being harshly self-critical, Geisel at one point or another in the evolution of each of his books has hurled his accumulated words and pictures onto the floor or into a fireplace, whence they are customarily retrieved by his wife and restored to his hands when he is in a less fractious mood. Perfectionism is his creed. He insists on retyping a page of copy if one word has been crossed out, and he has spent up to three days worrying about the appositeness of a single adjective. It is his habit, once he has finished a book, to deliver it in person to Random House, and as the time for setting off cross country draws near, he becomes increasingly morose. The night before he heads East, he usually goes without sleep. He spreads the pages of his book out on the floor of his living room and crawls back and forth in anguish among them, hovering over the composite parts with the awkward concern of his brood elephant. Sometimes, for last-minute advice or plain bucking up, he summons his next-door neighbor, a seventy-five-year-old businessman named Bert L. Hupp—one of the few people around, aside from Mrs. Geisel, in whose judgment of Dr. Seuss’s output Geisel has any faith. Hupp, who is the board chairman of the Sunshine Biscuit Company and was formerly a director of the Santa Fe Railroad, drops to his knees, too, and encourages Geisel with the kind of pep talk that a football coach might deliver in a locker room. When Random House hears that Geisel is on the way with another pot of gold, excitement runs high, and when he arrives, all hands convene in the office of Louise Bonino, the juvenile editor, for a reading and showing of the latest Dr. Seuss. Even the switchboard operators have been known to leave their post, to the consternation of television producers, lecture agents, Nobel Prize winners, and other outsiders vainly seeking the ear of Bennett Cerf. Geisel, always a high-strung man, is at his tensest during these performances. At the close of one of them, he retreated in dejection to the Madison Hotel, where he usually stays while in New York, and spent a week rewriting three pages, because he felt that nobody at Random House had laughed hard enough at them. Many authors who have turned in a manuscript and learned that it has been accepted are happy to leave the technicalities of its transformation into a book up to their publishers. Not Geisel. Invading the production department, he will dump three or four moldy bits of crayon, or some scraps torn from matchbooks, onto Ray Freiman’s desk and say that they are precisely the shades of color he wants used in this or that illustration. That it is often extremely difficult to match up printing ink with crayon does not bother him. Random House has learned to ride with his punches. “From a genius you tolerate a little bit more,” one editor there has observed. Just to keep Geisel pacified, his publisher spends twenty-five per cent more on the paper in his books than on that in any other author’s, and two or three times as much as the norm on preparing his color plates for the press. Nevertheless, Geisel still complains loudly if, in the thirteenth or fourteenth printing of one of his works, he perceives one color to be a tiny bit off register. After more than a hundred thousand copies of “The Cat in the Hat Comes Back” had been sold, he decided that a single black line on the original jacket was too black, and a new jacket was made up. In this vigorous policing of his output he is encouraged by his neighbor Hupp, who keeps telling him, as they jointly prune a camellia or spray a lemon tree in La Jolla, “Be tough. Keep your standards up. It’s your product, and don’t you let anybody talk you into letting it slip.”"

In May of this year, Carrier announced its time line for eliminating what will ultimately be six hundred and thirty-two Indianapolis-based jobs. The first round of layoffs began on Thursday, with the departure of three hundred and thirty-eight employees. Watching with dismay was Brenda Darlene Battle, a fifty-five-year-old Indianapolis native who’d been working at Carrier for twenty-five years, most recently as a fabrication technician, or fab tech, before she decided to take a buyout this week*. She helped run the automatic press that makes steel doors, among other parts, for A90 furnaces. When the final furnace door was completed on the first day of mass layoffs, employees working the assembly line—some for the last time—autographed it. On Friday, shortly before finalizing paperwork related to her departure, Battle spoke by phone about the company that employed her for a quarter century, President Trump, and her future. Her account has been edited and condensed.

On February 10, 2016, the Carrier Corporation, an H.V.A.C. company founded in 1915, announced that it would be closing plants in Indianapolis and Huntington, Indiana, and moving to Monterrey, Mexico. Months later, at the first Presidential debate with Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump brought up the closings. “We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people,” he said. “All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air-conditioning in Indianapolis. They left—fired fourteen hundred people. They’re going to Mexico.” Shortly after the election, Trump and Mike Pence, who was then the governor of Indiana, announced a headline-grabbing deal with Carrier that was said to keep about eight hundred jobs in the U.S. “So many people in that other—the big, beautiful plant behind us, which will be even more beautiful in about seven months from now, they’re so happy,” Trump said at a celebratory press conference .

“I’ve been working at Carrier since I was thirty. I didn’t go to high school or college. My parents were union people. My dad was an oiler for G.M. I did a lot of babysitting before I joined the assembly line at Carrier. When I started, in 1992, they were threatening to move to Mexico, and any time they got pissed off, that was their old threat: ‘We’re gonna move to Mexico, anyway!’ That’s what management would say.

“It used to be a fun place to work; I didn’t mind going. Then they started making changes that only benefit them: robots, cutting jobs. Just yesterday, they were talking about cutting a three-man blower-shelf crew—they deal with the forms that hold the blower on one side and the heating element on the other—down to two. But two people can’t do that job. My job running the press, it was a two-man job, but then they brought a robot in. The doors go down the conveyor belt now, and the robot stacks them in the cart.

“It seemed like as soon as they first put the robots in, they made the announcement about layoffs a month later. I’ll never forget that day. They told everyone to meet them at the front of the plant. Then, when they got up there, that’s when they told us they were really moving to Mexico. It just went downhill after that. We knew change was coming, we just didn’t know what. But it went to hell in a gasoline-soaked handbasket in February of last year. They could have been a lot more professional about making the announcement.

“This is peak season for the industry right now. We work six or seven days a week. So those people at work is basically your family. Of the three hundred and thirty-eight who left yesterday, I knew over a hundred of them, because I had worked days and nights over the years. I knew a lot of people. My fiancé worked security at Carrier in the late nineties, and he had just died three or four days before the announcement in February of last year. So I was grieving. I was stressed out, on bereavement. When he passed, I moved home to live with my parents. Then, last December, my mom passed. So it’s me and my dad and my sister and her children, in one house.

“Trump came in there to the factory last December and blew smoke up our asses. He wasn’t gonna save those jobs. And, if that’s the case, he would have saved us and Rexnord, a company around the corner from us that makes parts.

“We had a mix of Trump supporters and Clinton supporters at the factory, I’d say. The ones that really supported him are quiet right now. Some of them got let go yesterday, too.

“We talked about Trump on the job, after the election. You could always tell who the Trump supporters were because they never participated in the conversation. It was about even, blacks and whites, for Trump. Also, some of them wore the hats. Not anymore, though.

“Personally, I think the President is a ‘rubber room’ politician. He’s crazy. He needs a straitjacket. He’s in there for his self. He’s not in there to help America keep jobs. Because if he was we wouldn’t be in the predicament that we’re in every day. He keeps howling, ‘Make America great.’ But he can’t make America great if all the jobs are leaving the States and going to Mexico. People can’t support their families.

“He has a thing against women, too. No woman is safe, to me. He wants to tell them what to do with their bodies. Women have been working for years, but he doesn’t want us to have insurance. Everybody came from a mother. Even him. I voted for Hillary. I think most of the people I worked with at Carrier voted for someone. The Trump people really thought he was gonna save our jobs.

“I think the C.E.O. of Carrier and Trump was in bed together the whole time. That day Trump came to Carrier, those two were too chummy. The way they sniggled and giggled. That sneaky kind of shit-eating grin.

“They sat us in the room based on seniority and job classification. On the aisle with me there was ninety-five years of seniority, just with three people: myself, my girlfriend, and this one guy who has been there forty-five or forty-six years. It was an experience, because not only was the media there, there were people from the E.P.A. We met a lot of interesting people that had nothing to do with Trump. I didn’t need to shake his hand.

“I’m going to be taking it very easy for a few months and do some of the things that my dad wants to do. He’s seventy-seven years old, but he thinks Trump blew smoke up our asses, too. We’d like to travel and see family in Cincinnati, Kentucky, Tennessee. I’ve got a little money saved. I’m in no hurry to look for another job quite yet.”

* A previous version of this article stated that Battle had been laid off. She decided to take a buyout the week that the layoffs took place."

Trump.

The order, which the Girls Scouts were granted on Monday night, prevents Trump from coming within three hundred feet of any gathering of the Scouts’ organization.

Carol Foyler, a Girl Scouts spokesperson, said that while the G.S.U.S.A. sought the restraining order “out of an abundance of caution,” the girls themselves were “in no way, shape or form” afraid of President Trump.

“They’re prepared to deal with bobcats and bears,” she said. “They can handle a malignant narcissist.”

Trump wasted little time responding to the Girl Scouts’ action, lashing out at the organization in a blistering early-morning tweet storm.

“Failing Girl Scouts bad (or sick) guys,” Trump wrote. “Mints, cookies terrible. Sad!”"

Trump pronounced the planet Earth a “loser” and vowed to make a better deal with a new planet.

“Earth is a terrible, very bad planet,” he told the White House press corps. “It’s maybe the worst planet in the solar system, and it’s far from the biggest.”

Trump blasted former President Barack Obama for signing deals that committed the United States to remain on the planet Earth indefinitely. “Obama is almost as big a loser as Earth,” Trump said. “If Obama was a planet, guess what planet he’d be? That’s right: Earth.”

When asked which planet he would make a new deal with, Trump offered few specifics, saying only, “The solar system has millions of terrific planets, and they’re all better than Earth, which is a sick, failing loser.”

Trump’s remarks drew a strong response from one of the United States’ NATO allies, Germany’s Angela Merkel. “I strongly support Donald Trump leaving the planet Earth,” she said."
http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/john-mccains-health-care-vote-was-an-act-of-defiance,newyorker,John McCain’s Health-Care Vote Was an Act of Defiance,[],"I had agreeable disagreements with two friends yesterday, several hours before the Senate’s 1:30 A.M. vote on the Republicans’ scaled-down motion to repeal the Affordable Care Act. When the final vote was called, three Republican senators—Susan Collins, of Maine; Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska; and John McCain, of Arizona—drove a long knife through the cold heart of Trumpcare/McConnellcare/Ryancare.

Senators Collins and Murkowski had stuck their necks out much further than any other Republican politicians in the country. For this they had been trolled, slandered, subjected to sexist insults, and bullied—most prominently by the President of the United States, a career scam artist who ages ago lost his marketing mojo. They weren’t buying it. For at least a few hours this week, Ryan Zinke, the never-not-an-Eagle Scout Secretary of the Interior and, until January 20th, a Republican member of Congress, was running strong in the competition for the most despicable thug in Washington, after he reportedly called Murkowski to indicate that her state would suffer as a result of her no vote. (Beautiful, Zinke! Beautiful!) Senators Collins and Murkowski weren’t buying that, either. Nor was Senator McCain.

One of my friends had read my piece about the dilemma McCain confronted , and told me candidly that he wasn’t really buying my argument, either. “An action that merely avoids indecency,” he said, “has only the palest claim to decency.” My friend has worked for many years in many ways on behalf of social and—especially—economic justice. Though he respected Barack Obama, and had voted for him, he took a dim view of many of Obama’s more centrist or conservative policies.

For McCain my friend had no regard (though he forgives him); his sins of commission and omission were many. Sarah Palin, in his view, was the most egregious transgression (hardly a minority viewpoint), but there were others, largely sins by association. In general, my friend loathes what he perceives as the rapacious capitalist cynicism of all the money-grubbing liars who run the banks and grease politicians of both parties and shuffle in and out of corporate boardrooms and Presidential Cabinets and talk out of every side of their mouths as the nation’s and the planet’s wealth and resources and social-justice gaps grow beyond their already criminally negligent dimensions. He detested Hillary Clinton’s candidacy. As for Trump, why bother? For months last year, the Republican nominee, anticipating electoral defeat and extreme humiliation, whined and screamed about a “rigged” election, all the while sliming his way to the White House.

My friend is certainly not alone in seeing that we are in a Hobbesian present. The United States as a nation of laws, as he sees it, is over. Certainly for the time being, and likely forever. The U.S. as a governable nation, also over. The U.S. as a world power bringing (mostly) democracy and goodness to others—over. And so on. My friend is a wholly decent, patriotic citizen of a country he no longer recognizes, even as the view from his window remains a rural New England pasture.

My other friend shared an equally jaundiced view: she had always thought of McCain as a conventional company man. “His sincere fidelity is to the institution,” she said. “It’s not an issue of humanity, or even a lack of humanity.” So, as an Annapolis graduate and a Navy pilot, and, likewise, as a prisoner of war, he behaved as he thought he should. McCain had been equally a creature, especially in recent years, of a Republican Party that moved further and further to the right, and further away from the bipartisan comity that he had for decades claimed to revere. “Let’s agree that a part of his biography is a tale of heroism and selflessness,” she said. “But if we’re talking about motivation, that’s far more banal.”

I agree with some of my friends’ sentiments. But, in my understanding, as the hour of the vote approached, John McCain elected not to be a company man. The institution that he had belonged to and loved for thirty years, the U.S. Senate, had become intolerable. Dishonorable.

For weeks and months, a burgeoning-until-overwhelming majority of Americans told their senators and congressmen that they did not want Obamacare declared null and void, its knotty flaws notwithstanding. Many of the forty-nine Republicans who cast votes in favor of this repeal knew that those votes bore the stench of unforgivable betrayal of the once-American ideal: equal treatment under the law, due process, and the unwritten imperative for a common purpose. Or perhaps they recognized that in their heads but were blind in their hearts—to their everlasting shame.

John McCain, bearing scars ancient and new, acutely aware of his mortality, humble but standing a very tall five feet nine, approached the hour when he had to choose. He chose to vote with his soul—in defiance of the bottomless soullessness that, when the ultimate moment arrived, he rejected."
http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/agnes-gunds-art-for-social-justices-sake,newyorker,Agnes Gund’s Art for Social Justice’s Sake,[],"Agnes Gund, the president emerita of the Museum of Modern Art, sometimes runs out of ready cash for her liberal philanthropy. “This is why I have to sell so much art, because I promise things that I can’t really pay for,” she told Andrew Goldstein , the editor of Artnet, last month. Hence Gund’s sale of “Masterpiece” (1962), by Roy Lichtenstein, a painting that for years had hung above the mantel in her Park Avenue apartment. She has given a hundred million dollars, from the sale price of a hundred and sixty-five million, to establish the Art for Justice Fund, dedicated to relieving mass incarceration in the United States. (The Ford Foundation will administer the fund, as an extension of its prior commitment to criminal-justice reform.) This is a new cause for Gund, whose many past ones include Studio in a School, which she founded, in 1977, to counter cuts to city and state funding for art education in public schools, and, for the past fifteen years, a concerted opposition to repealing the estate tax.

Several stories crisscross in Gund’s spectacular gesture. The happiest is about her. She has been bettering New York for more than half a century, since she arrived, from Cleveland, as a banking heiress with a deep love of art, later bolstered by a master’s degree in art history from Harvard and a gnawing social conscience. Her services to MOMA , as a versatile official and an ever-ready patron, include steady pressure for the recognition and hiring of women and minorities—for her, an intimate concern. She has six African-American grandchildren. In person, Gund is soft-spoken and serious, but given to touches of warm humor. Her presence lends a familial air and an infectious self-respect to any art event.

Another narrative pertains to the eclectic tribe of very rich people in the vicinity of art and its institutions. The love of art—even the same art—crosses political aisles. Steven A. Cohen, a hedge-fund billionaire and a MOMA board member not usually associated with progressive causes, bought “Masterpiece.” (Cohen and his wife, Alexandra, swelled a PAC for Chris Christie with a few million dollars, in 2015, and reportedly chipped in a million for Donald Trump’s Inauguration.) The art world traditionally, and still, tilts to the left, but an increasing number of conservatives populate its upper echelons of collecting and patronage. The Koch brothers are both critically influential contributors to conservative causes and major patrons of the arts. (They also have an expressed interest in criminal-justice reform; perhaps they know of Gund’s new project.) The Cohens just announced that their philanthropic foundation will give fifty million dollars to MOMA , to support the museum’s expansion plan. This earns them naming rights: the museum’s sixth floor will house the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Center for Special Exhibitions.

Roy Lichtenstein died in 1997. What might he think of all this, if he were alive today? He was a Democrat; he created prints in support of Dukakis, in 1988, and of Clinton-Gore, in 1992. But his overriding drive was to bring qualities of high art into taut accord with motifs from commercial mass culture. There is a term for that kind of aspiration: American. Pop art essentialized—or freeze-dried, as things developed—a national dream of at least consumerist democracy. No amount of money, Andy Warhol said, can buy you a better Coca-Cola than the one that a homeless man on the street is drinking. Social historians, with critics consulting, might explain the stages of how and why symbols of that movement and moment, preëminently by Lichtenstein and Warhol, became nine-figure top prizes for oligarchs.

Then there’s the matter of artistic values conflated with the prices that the oligarchs are able—far beyond able, actually, given the colossal scale of their fortunes—and eager to pay. In a world that made more sense to me than ours does, “Masterpiece” would not now be, as the Times reported , one of the fifteen most expensive art works ever sold. It is a typical Lichtenstein, made “iconic” (a workhorse buzzword, these days) by the echt nineteen-sixties cool of its subject and style. A generically pretty woman gushes to a generically manly man, regarding a stretched canvas that we glimpse from the back, “Why, Brad darling, this painting is a masterpiece! My, soon you’ll have all of New York clamoring for your work!” Lichtenstein invests a mediocre comic-strip image with startling formal integrity. The work emits what auction people call “wall power.” Did the artist make many paintings that are as good, and some that are better? Yes, for what that’s worth, apropos a market that steamrolls discrimination.

Finally, Gund’s coup initiates an unfolding tale of responsible luck. She has said that she hopes other collectors will siphon excess money through the crazily inflated art market to ameliorative worldly ends. Some are already responding to her call. The Times reported that Laurie M. Tisch, a chairwoman of the Whitney Museum, announced a contribution of half a million dollars to the Justice Fund, from her sale of a Max Weber painting, saying of Gund, “I was moved by her passion.” Call it volunteer taxation, pending enough of the legislated kind, or, in Gund’s words for her aim, “solving problems through art.”"
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/sculling-for-trump,newyorker,Sculling for Trump,[],"Last week, the future looked grim for Trump loyalists. Robert Mueller’s investigation picked up steam; Trumpcare stalled in the Senate; and, six months into his term, the President had the highest disapproval ratings since Presidential polling was invented. Yet, if you were a food vender, a rollerblader, or a yogini on the West Side of Manhattan, you might have been comforted, or triggered, by a familiar spectacle: a one-man racing shell, bobbing in the Hudson River, flying a flag that said “Trump 2020.”

“I’m out here every weekday,” Dion Cini, the rower, said. “I’ve been doing it since March, and I’ll be out doing it until the 2020 election. The only thing that might change—and I doubt this will happen—but, if they do actually indict Trump and kick him out of office, I’ll just change it to a Pence flag and keep going.”

Cini lives on the Upper West Side. On Tuesday morning, he rode a foldable bike to the small midtown boathouse where he stores his scull. “I don’t live like other people,” he said. “I cook my own food. I wash my own clothes. I don’t know when we stopped being self-sufficient in this country.” Cini is forty-eight, tan, and stocky; a veteran, he wore a U.S. Marine Corps visor and sunglasses. He stashed his bike and changed out of a wicking shirt into an even-more-wicking mesh tank top, revealing a biceps tattoo based on the Disney movie “Fantasia.” “Ask me how many times I’ve been to Disney World,” he said. “A thousand. I model my life after Walt Disney’s in many ways. He was an überconservative, which is what I’d call myself.” Cini owns a business that sells software to hospitals, and it does well enough for him to live as if he were semi-retired. “During the summer, I mostly let my staff do the work,” he said. “Sometimes I’ll take a call while I’m out on the river, and the person on the other end will go, ‘Do I hear water in the background?’ ” He was untroubled by Trump’s failure to overhaul the health-care system. “I made a bunch of money during Obamacare, to be honest,” he said. “As for the other stuff—the tweets, the ‘grab ’em by the pussy’—it’s stupid, but it’s Trump being Trump. He’s got a good heart, that’s the important thing.”

Cini dragged the scull—eighteen feet long and pencil-shaped—from the boathouse to the dock, then affixed pontoons to its sides and the Trump flag to its stern. The provocation has a purpose, he said. “I’m not out here just to make a scene. It’s campaign advertising—Trump 2020.” Depending on the current, he rows to Governors Island, or over to Brooklyn, or up to the Bronx. “I’ve probably been seen by hundreds of thousands of people,” he said. “I know there are tourists, maybe even New Yorkers, who think there is not a single Trump supporter in this city. Well, now they know there’s at least one.”

On an average day, Cini said, he draws twenty thumbs-ups and “at least a hundred” middle fingers. “The guys doing construction on Hudson Yards—they’re always supportive. So are the Coast Guard boats, the Fire Department boats. Down around the West Village is where things start turning ugly. In Brooklyn, they sometimes try to come up with something witty, but in the West Village it’s always the same: ‘Fuck Trump!’ ‘I hope you drown!’ My favorite is ‘He’ll never win.’ I just go, ‘Yep, that’s what you said last time.’ ”

Shortly before noon, Cini shoved the scull into the water and started rowing downriver. Another boathouse member, returning from a standup paddle ride, watched him go. “Everybody is polite to him,” the paddleboarder said. “There are definitely side conversations—‘What is he thinking?’—but we would never say anything, in case he’s, like, aggressive.”

Cini hugged the shore, to avoid barges and to listen for catcalls. Just south of Chelsea, a handful of construction workers chanted, “Go Trump!” Around Pier 40, a jogger shouted, “You and Trump can both go fuck yourselves!” An hour later, he entered the North Cove Marina, a yacht-filled inlet near the World Trade Center. The dockmaster greeted him, unperturbed by the Trump flag. “We try to stay neutral,” he said. “Better for business.”

Cini removed the flag and took it on a stroll around the marina. “Let’s go fishing for snowflakes,” he said, and called out, “Trump 2020! Ivanka 2024! Barron 2040!” A woman wearing office clothes and eating a takeout salad said to a friend, “I should give that guy the finger, but I’m too lazy.”

Cini sat at an outdoor restaurant. On a TV screen behind the bar, Senator Chuck Schumer was accusing the President of trying to “sabotage” the health-care system. “The more people yell at me, the more determined I get,” Cini said. “Honestly, if I were doing this in St. Louis or Dallas, I’d just get bored.” ♦"

http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-ceo-of-girls-who-code-wants-you-to-know-that-its-ok-to-fail,newyorker,The C.E.O. of Girls Who Code Wants You to Know That It’s O.K. to Fail,[],"There’s an unofficial rule in the tech world: every C.E.O. must have a formative anecdote of failure. Reshma Saujani has an imposing résumé—she has delivered speeches at the White House and on Richard Branson’s private island; she knows Sheryl Sandberg’s personal phone number; her nonprofit, Girls Who Code, has given free computer-science instruction to forty thousand young women—and yet she often leads with her failure story. In 2010, Saujani ran for Congress, in New York’s Twelfth District, against a popular incumbent. “Every pollster told me, ‘You can’t possibly win this race,’ ” she said. “I ran anyway. I raised money from everyone from John Legend to Jack Dorsey.” Saujani, who is now forty-one, has a gap-toothed smile that she deploys to self-deprecating effect. “And then I lost. Humiliatingly. Not even close.”

Before Saujani was born, her parents, Indians living in Uganda, were driven out of the country and resettled in the United States as refugees. “They were, understandably, very risk-averse,” she told me. “They didn’t encourage adventurousness, especially in their daughter. So for me to fall short so publicly—well, it sucked, but it made me get over my fear.” The moral of her story: young women should be rewarded for bravery, not perfection. “Girls Who Code tries to teach, Don’t worry about getting a hundred on the test; just start messing around with Python,” she said, referring to a coding language. “Trial and error. That’s how you learn.”

Girls Who Code sponsors after-school clubs in all fifty states; Saujani, who lives in New York but is bicoastal-curious, has visited dozens of them. One afternoon in 2016, not long before the start of summer vacation, she was driven to the small neighborhood that lies between the footings of the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges. She got out in front of a four-story red-brick building—Public School 126, also called the Manhattan Academy of Technology, where students range from pre-kindergarten to eighth grade. The P.S. 126 chapter was throwing an informal end-of-year party. “I hear they’re gonna present the projects they made!” Saujani said, with the requisite enthusiasm.

As students poured out of the school, Saujani, walking upstream, made her way to the fourth floor. Long before she got there, she could hear a Rihanna song playing at full volume; it turned out to originate in a supply closet, where a janitor was dancing while he wrung out a mop. “ That’s the party we should be going to,” Saujani said. She proceeded to a classroom at the end of the hall, where G.W.C. students and a few of their parents were setting out food: trays of noodles and dumplings, bags of tortilla chips, a summer-roll station with shrimp, carrots, and hoisin sauce. There were about a dozen girls and three boys, who called themselves “friends of G.W.C.” The mother of one of the boys complained about the program’s name, on gender-exclusion grounds, to Hau-Yu Chu, a technology teacher and the club’s coördinator. Chu responded, “Don’t worry, next year we’ll change it to Tech Club,” which Saujani, entering the room, either did not hear or pretended not to hear.

“Sit quietly!” Chu said, and the students obeyed the first half of the instruction. Saujani stood at the front of the classroom. “I’m Reshma, the C.E.O. of Girls Who Code,” she said. “We want girls to think about majoring in science or tech when they get to college. But that’s hard, and so we want you to be comfortable with imperfection.” This was paraphrased from her TED Talk. There, she’d received a standing ovation; here, the line barely caused audience members to glance up from their summer rolls. “Let’s go around the room and say one thing you’ve learned this year,” Saujani suggested.

Tina, a shy sixth grader with thick glasses, said, “I learned that one little mistake can mess everything up.”

“So, you learned how to fail?” Saujani said.

“I guess,” Tina said.

“Time for presentations,” Chu said. “Go quickly!”

The first student had made a gadget out of littleBits, small circuits connected wirelessly to the Web. “This is a vibrator,” she said. Saujani suppressed a laugh. “You put it under your pillow, connect it to the timer on your phone, and it works like an alarm clock.”

Tina went next. As she connected her laptop to a projector, the computer stalled. In a panic, she covered the projector with her hands, preventing the class from seeing the frozen screen.

“It’s O.K. if it’s not perfect,” Saujani said.

“Aaargh!” Tina said, putting her hands to her cheeks, as in Munch’s “The Scream.” Eventually, she was able to present her idea: a proposal for a hypothetical app she called Study Buddies, which would match up potential study partners remotely.

“That looks amazing,” Saujani said. “Did it make you want to start a business?” When Tina demurred, Saujani addressed the rest of the class. “Who here wants to start a real business?” she asked. A couple of hands went up, tentatively. “Who wants to buy a big house one day?” One or two more hands. “Who wants to buy a big house for Mom and Dad one day?”

“You’d better raise your hand for that,” one mother said, elbowing her son. His hand went up."
http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-decline-of-opera-queens-and-the-rise-of-gay-opera,newyorker,The Decline of Opera Queens and the Rise of Gay Opera,[],"Whether these offerings can reignite opera-queen culture remains to be seen. They certainly compensate for the long decades when gay people projected themselves onto an art form that failed to reflect them in return. (One notable development: not all of the above operas are by gay composers.) Troublingly, though, male stories far outnumber female ones, with attendant marketing campaigns featuring buff male bodies. In the nineteen-nineties, American Opera Projects commissioned Paula Kimper to compose “Patience & Sarah,” a lesbian romance that had its première at the Lincoln Center Festival in 1998. It has had very few successors at mainstream opera houses. American music hardly lacks lesbian composers of distinction—Meredith Monk, Jennifer Higdon, Annea Lockwood, and Kristin Norderval, among others, come to mind—and they should be part of the gay-opera wave, if they are so inclined.

Even so, operas on gay themes have proliferated. Since 2010, the crop of gay-oriented works has included—flute trill, please—Jorge Martín’s “Before Night Falls” and Charles Wuorinen’s “Brokeback Mountain,” stories familiar from film; Theodore Morrison’s “Oscar,” on the life of Wilde; Terence Blanchard’s “Champion,” about the gay African-American boxer Emile Griffith; two period operas by Gregory Spears, “Paul’s Case” and “Fellow Travelers”; Mark Simpson’s “Pleasure,” set at a gay night club; Kevin March’s “Les Feluettes,” based on Michel Marc Bouchard’s play “Lilies”; Andrea Scartazzini’s “Edward II,” about the scandalous British monarch; Ricky Ian Gordon’s “27,” portraying the partnership of Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas; and Laura Kaminsky’s “As One,” a tale of transgender life. Last month, Peter Eötvös’s 2004 adaptation of Tony Kushner’s “Angels in America” was staged at New York City Opera , and Lou Harrison’s pioneering 1971 opera, “Young Caesar,” a portrait of Julius Caesar as a young bisexual, resurfaced at the Los Angeles Philharmonic.

How gay is opera? According to popular folklore, very. The culture indicated by the phrase “opera queen” became visible in pioneering openly gay communities of the late nineteenth century, and undoubtedly existed long before that. Xavier Mayne’s “The Intersexes,” a 1908 defense of homosexuality, included a self-diagnostic questionnaire—titled “Am I at All an Uranian?”—with such leading questions as “Do you prefer operatic or more abstract music . . .?” and “Are you peculiarly fond of Wagner?” Twentieth-century novels and plays show pale men and women who haunt the standing-room section at the opera and fixate upon the divas of the day. The scholar Terry Castle calls opera-queen culture “a tradition of awe, delight, and comic self-abasement as old as the opera itself.” By the nineteen-seventies and eighties, though, the venerable stereotype had receded. As Wayne Koestenbaum argues in his elegiac 1993 book, “The Queen’s Throat,” the opera queen became a signifier of a pre-Stonewall mentality—a time of “displaced eroticism,” when gay men and lesbians had to express themselves in florid codes. “After sexual liberation,” Koestenbaum asks, “who needs opera?” These days, younger gay people are far likelier to use pop music as a lingua franca. Beyoncé displaces Caballé.

The first gay character in opera is usually said to be the Countess Geschwitz, who appears in Alban Berg’s all-eclipsing masterpiece “Lulu,” unfinished at the time of the composer’s death, in 1935. Geschwitz not only declares her love for the title character but is given the final words : “Lulu! My angel! . . . I will stay near you! Into eternity!” But there were murmurs of homosexuality before that. Richard Strauss’s “Salome,” based on the Wilde play, features a male page smitten with the captain of Herod’s guard. That was 1905; four years earlier, Xavier Leroux’s now forgotten opera “Astarté” raised eyebrows in Paris. The libretto, devised by the decadent dramatist Louis de Gramont, is a fantasia on the story of Heracles’ enslavement to Queen Omphale: here, Omphale is the priestess of the Sapphic cult of Astarté, and Heracles is shown in drag, observing what appears to be a ceremonial lesbian orgy. Heracles intends to put an end to the debauchery but falls in love with Omphale instead. His only escape from this predicament is to don the fatal Shirt of Nessus, which has been dipped in centaur blood. He catches fire, and amid the ensuing conflagration Omphale escapes. The opera ends with the priestess reconstituting her Sapphic circle on the isle of Lesbos, as a chorus sings, “Glory to pleasure.” The Jahrbuch für sexuelle Zwischenstufen, the journal founded by the German gay activist Magnus Hirschfeld , took note: “ ‘Astarté’ is probably the first opera to be performed, and generally the first theatre piece, in which lesbian love is represented.”

In the twentieth century, the field of gay opera was dominated by Benjamin Britten. From “Peter Grimes” to “Billy Budd” and on to “Death in Venice,” Britten chose subjects with an oblique or obvious gay slant. Yet his obsessive scrutiny of the figure of the innocent boy has given him an uneasy place in the pantheon of gay composers. Michael Tippett, Britten’s compatriot and contemporary, ventured further in his 1970 opera, “The Knot Garden,” whose ensemble cast includes Dov, a gay white musician, and Mel, a bisexual black writer. What was audacious at the time can now seem problematic: characters in the opera are doubled with those of “The Tempest,” and Mel is cast as Caliban. But Tippett’s modern-minded sketch of same-sex love was a crucial step.

Dozens of twentieth-century American composers, from Aaron Copland and Virgil Thomson on down, were gay. Lou Harrison, whose centennial arrived in the spring , lived more openly than almost all of his contemporaries. In 1942, he told a draft board that he was homosexual, and, in a 1946 review of an edition of Tchaikovsky’s diaries, he gave a sympathetic cast to the composer’s customarily pathologized love life. With “Young Caesar,” Harrison became the first major composer to place a same-sex relationship at the heart of an opera. This was Caesar’s alleged affair with Nicomedes, King of Bithynia. Rome being Rome, the problem for Caesar’s contemporaries was not that he had bedded another man but that he had reportedly neglected to stay on top. One joke went, “ Gallias Caesar subegit, Nicomedes Caesarem ” (“Caesar conquered Gaul, Nicomedes conquered Caesar”). Caesar denied the rumors, but they stuck.

Harrison was drawn to the material not simply because of its gay content—there are more obvious stories he could have told—but also because it involved an encounter between East and West. He had long loved Indonesian gamelan music, and, in the opera, he made use of gamelan-like instruments that he and his partner, William Colvig, had constructed. Harrison was also a pacifist, and wished to show a moment in Caesar’s life when he was tempted to abandon a career of conquest. Robert Gordon, the librettist for the project, created a text with an arch, fable-like tone. Handel, one of Harrison’s favorite composers, was the model for the opera’s stately, unhurried arias.

“Young Caesar” has received few performances over the years, its progress hampered by dramatic weaknesses. Harrison revised it extensively but never solved its problems. In the L.A. Phil production, which was directed by Yuval Sharon , Harrison’s labor of love has finally achieved persuasive form. What it needed was a frame that enhanced its fairy-tale quality. Intermingling ritual and play—a cinematic ballet of animated phalluses figured in one scene—Sharon created an entertainment of trancelike grace. Caesar and Nicomedes, played affectingly by Adam Fisher and Hadleigh Adams, share tender embraces, but sexuality is almost incidental: instead, we watch a timeless scenario of a young man torn between love and ambition. There is no mention of Caesar’s bloody end, but we have the sense that he made the wrong choice.

A second wave of gay operas began in the nineteen-nineties, in the wake of the outspoken activism of ACT UP and Queer Nation. In 1995, Houston Grand Opera, which had introduced John Adams’s “Nixon in China,” staged Stewart Wallace’s “Harvey Milk,” an uneven but at times potent dramatization of Milk’s exuberant life and shocking death. In a tribute to opera-queen culture, the opera includes a scene in the standing room at the Metropolitan Opera, with a male chorus of “Tessitura. / Bel Canto. / Passaggio.”

That a composer would turn to “Angels in America,” the most imposing drama to emerge from modern gay life, seemed inevitable. Kushner knows his Wagner, and “Angels in America” fuses myth and history on a scale comparable to that of the “Ring.” Eötvös is an adroit and experienced opera composer who has set everything from Chekhov’s “Three Sisters” to Jean Genet’s “The Balcony.” In “Angels,” he deftly employs an array of avant-garde techniques to herald ecstatic visitations and hallucinatory flights. Yet Kushner’s rhetorical grandeur and mystical intensity elude him: you want a latter-day Wagner to unleash opulent orchestral gestures equal to lines like “The Great Work begins.” The good news is that the revived City Opera, at the close of its second season, put together a persuasive account of a tricky score. The production, by Sam Helfrich, was sleek and incisive; Andrew Garland and Aaron Blake, as the lovers Prior and Louis, sang with vocal allure and dramatic urgency. City Opera plans to stage a gay-themed opera each year during pride month; Wuorinen’s “Brokeback Mountain,” which the old City Opera commissioned and then set aside, is scheduled for 2018.

Of the recent gay operas I’ve seen, those that linger longest in my mind are the two by Spears. “ Paul’s Case ,” inspired by the Willa Cather story, merely hints at the sexuality of its central figure, who flees from dull reality to his doom. “Fellow Travelers,” based on Thomas Mallon’s novel, is set in the period of Cold War homophobic witch hunts; it is a tale of forbidden love without a happy ending, although neither of its lead characters meets the tragic fate common in narratives of this type. What sets these pieces apart is the intimate power of Spears’s musical voice, which is unlike that of any composer now working—a kind of shivery, fraught simplicity. Ultimately, opera hinges not on a composer’s passion for the subject but on his or her affinity with the material: there must be a sense that the story could be told no other way. Spears has an eerie ability to suggest interior landscapes that go unseen, interior lives that go unspoken. In giving us glimpses of hidden selves, his music becomes universal in reach."
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/the-resurrection-of-freak-bar,newyorker,The Resurrection of Freak Bar,[],"In the early evening of October 29, 2012, a five-foot swell from the Atlantic Ocean inundated the Freak Bar, the carnivalesque epicenter of Coney Island pop culture. Pouring past the boardwalk, the surge of corrosive salt water arrived at Surf Avenue thick with debris. Dick Zigun—the sixty-four-year-old tattooed impresario of the nonprofit that administers the bar and the iconic circus sideshow next door (a live ten-act spectacle featuring, among other oddities, a contortionist, a sword swallower, and a snake charmer)—was devastated. “Most of what we had didn’t survive,” he said on a recent Saturday afternoon at the bar, over a Coney Island Mermaid Pilsner. (No liquor here, but on a hot summer day the beer and wine offerings—which also include the home-town brewery’s watermelon ale—are refreshment enough.) Among the casualties was Zigun’s 1963 Seeburg jukebox. Gone, too, were scores of antique tchotchkes he had collected over three decades. With guidance from FEMA , an ad-hoc six-person recovery crew led by a former fire-eater salvaged what it could. A cherry-red countertop was re-created with steel and sealed wood, and the remaining ornaments migrated to conspicuously higher ground. By summer, the Freak Bar had reprised its role as the peninsula’s premier chamber of Coney Island kitsch, and as a quiet oasis for curious wayfarers seeking refuge from the sun. “Some day, the water is going to come back,” Zigun said, with cheery stoicism. “We’re much better prepared.” As a cavalier jab to the gods, he had cartoonish wave lines decaled across the windows, marking the height of the storm water. Suddenly, a loud siren blared, signalling to patrons in board shorts and bikinis that the next freak show would soon begin. ♦"
http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson-sorkin/donald-trump-tramples-on-boy-scout-values,newyorker,Donald Trump Tramples on Boy Scout Values,[],"President Donald Trump was onstage at the quadrennial National Boy Scout Jamboree on Monday, in Glen Jean, West Virginia, when he turned to Tom Price, his Secretary of Health and Human Services and a former Scout, who was standing behind him, with a question. “You going to get the votes?” he asked. The votes in question, he’d explained to the Scouts in attendance, were for “killing this horrible thing known as Obamacare that’s really hurting us, folks,” in favor of a Republican bill that would deprive an estimated twenty-two million Americans of their health-care coverage. He didn’t ask the Scouts if any of their families might be among that number; instead, he asked them to join him in mocking his subordinate.

“He’d better get them,” Trump said. “He’d better get them. Ooh, he’d better—otherwise, I’ll say, ‘Tom, you’re fired !’ ” He delivered this line with his signature finger-pointing gesture, and basked in hoots from the crowd. Another President might have evoked the kinds of stories that the Scouts share over campfires, or on the trail. Trump started with the assumption that they had spent quality time huddled in front of a television set, watching him on “ The Apprentice .” What is a merit badge, after all, next to winning a challenge to come up with a campaign for a Trump-branded product?

The televised image of him punishing an underling seemed to bring Trump particular pleasure, because it had to do with the one Boy Scout value that the President highlighted, rather than ignored, albeit in a distorted form: loyalty. The broadest point of criticism about Trump’s appearance at the event has been that he politicized the moment, but that was not, or not exactly, the main problem. The Boy Scouts do have a political meaning; otherwise, the various fights over the years to expand the franchise, as it were, by lifting a ban on gay Scouts, in 2014, and, a year later, on gay Scout leaders, would not have been so fraught. It was in the name of speaking politically about that ban that President Barack Obama skipped the jamboree, though he sent a recorded message. (Trump elided that reason when he asked the Scouts, sarcastically, whether Obama had shown up.) Other Presidents have spoken at the jamboree about democratic values, at times in the form of warnings about tyranny abroad, or about specific issues, such as drug addiction. (The Washington Post has a good catalogue .) They were, though, more subtle than Trump, who, after joking about firing Price, added, “He’d better get Senator Capito to vote for it!”—a reference to Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, who so far has been hesitant to jettison the interests of her constituents to vote for her party’s miserable health-care bill. What was different about Trump was not that he spoke politically but that he did so in a way that was demagogic, non-inclusive, dishonest, and, at times, simply crude.

One parable that Trump presented to the boys—it was, again, more of a reality-television recap than a campfire tale—included several of those elements. It involved a man in the tri-state area, a builder of homes, perhaps much like the President, who, three quarters of a century ago, “became an unbelievable success, and got more and more successful.” The man was named William Levitt—“Anyone ever hear of Levittown?”—and Trump made him sound like the miller’s daughter from “Rumpelstiltskin”: “At night he’d go to these major sites with teams of people and he’d scour the sites for nails and sawdust and small pieces of wood. And they’d clean the site so when the workers came in the next morning, the sites would be spotless and clean, and he did it properly. And he did this for twenty years, and then he was offered a lot of money for his company.” Like magic! And, of course, with the help of the G.I. Bill’s mortgage assistance, and while refusing to sell to black home buyers until he was forced to after a long series of lawsuits—but Trump, whose own family of builders had to settle discrimination suits, skipped that. What mattered was that Levitt “sold his company for a tremendous amount of money. And he went out and bought a big yacht. And he had a very interesting life.”

It was at this point that the President of the United States began to leer in front of forty thousand Boy Scouts. He hadn’t forgotten whom he was talking to; their adolescent male status, and all that he imagined that to mean, was, rather, the point: “You’re Boy Scouts, so I’m not going to tell you what he did.” He spoke like a man who wanted to be asked to post some lewd pictures: “Should I tell you? Should I tell you? Oh, you’re Boy Scouts, but you know life.”

He never did say what happened on the yacht, which, according to Levitt’s Times obituary , was named La Belle Simone, for his third wife. When Levitt sold his business to I.T.T., he got sixty-two million dollars of that company’s stock. He borrowed recklessly against it, got involved in shaky foreign ventures with dubious partners, and lost it all. (“There were terrible articles, and he would say, ‘Ah, Simone, it’s yellow journalism. You can’t believe what you read. Do you trust me?’ ” Simone Levitt told New York magazine, in 2013.) Trump acknowledged the fall, but offered the Boy Scouts a different explanation, one that was revealed when he, Trump, approached the sage at a cocktail party thrown by Steve Ross, whom he seemed to assume was a stock figure for the Boy Scouts. (“One of the great people—he came up and discovered, really founded, Time Warner.”) It was one of the “hottest” parties, and people were ignoring “the once great William Levitt of Levittown.” Whether this was because, as Trump posited, there were so many other celebrities around, or because it was around the time that Levitt was charged with wrongly taking five million dollars from a charitable foundation, is anybody’s guess. Trump, who, as the Washington Post pointed out, once had his own foundation pay Donald Trump, Jr.,’s seven-dollar Boy Scout registration fee, may not have cared. What Trump of Trump Tower wanted to know was how Levitt had fallen so far.

“And he said, ‘Donald, I lost my momentum. I lost my momentum,’ ” Trump said. It was, the President told the Scouts, too true. For anyone taking a glance at Levitt’s career, it was also baffling. Momentum toward what, with what values to guide him? Success, a word that Trump uses frequently, was the theme of his speech, and yet he could hardly have imagined that concept—and how it applied to the boys who were listening to him and their place in the world—in a more bereft way: kill Obamacare; mind your yacht; fire people who don’t deliver, because “we could use some more loyalty, I will tell you that.” He announced, “The Scouts believe in putting America First!”; The “fake news” media was going to lie about their number; under the Trump Administration, “you’ll be saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again when you go shopping. Believe me. ‘Merry Christmas!’ ”

After telling the tale of William Levitt, and offering a brief rumination about not taking too much time off, and the foolishness of most business advice other than his own (“Some of these guys that never made ten cents, they’re on television giving you things about how you’re going to be successful, and the only thing they ever did was a book and a tape”), Trump moved on to asking the boys if they remembered the great night when he won the election. He pictured them, again, watching television. “That map was so red, it was unbelievable! “ he said. That was back when he had momentum."
http://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/tips-for-visiting-new-york-city,newyorker,Tips for Visiting New York City,[],"Don't take an unlicensed car from the airport that's being driven by your arguing parents.

When you're exhausted after a long flight, it might seem like a good idea to go with the first person who asks if you need a ride, but you should never get into an unlicensed car that's being operated by your parents as they viciously argue with each other. At the very best, they'll ignore you completely as they scream at one another for the entire ride. In the worst-case scenario, they might demand that you pick a side in the fight, or they might stop in the middle of the road and refuse to drive any farther until they feel that they have proved a point.

Watch out for people selling CDs in Times Square who are members of the band Slipknot.

Times Square is one of the most popular destinations for tourists in the city. It's also the most popular place for members of Slipknot, the heavy-metal band known for its scary masks and jumpsuits, to hawk their latest release to passersby. They'll try to convince you that they're not trying to hustle you or rip you off, but if you take one of their ""free"" CDs, they'll surround you and aggressively demand that you pay for it. To make matters worse, when you get home and listen to the CDs, they will be full of music by Slipknot.

Make sure that you know the difference between local and Starlight Express trains.

It can take a little while to master the intricacies of the New York City subway system, but one way to get started is to make sure that you know which trains are running local and which are running productions of ""Starlight Express,"" the rock musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber. It's confusing at first, but the local trains will usually be marked with signs that read ""Local"" and will make more frequent stops, whereas Starlight Express train cars will be filled with performers on roller skates belting out songs like, ""I Am the Starlight,"" ""Light at the End of the Tunnel,"" and the titular ""Starlight Express.""

The public restroom in Bill de Blasio's house closes at 6 P.M.

While New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and his family are very happy for tourists to use the bathroom at Gracie Mansion, they do, understandably, need a little time to themselves. If you're looking for a bathroom on the Upper East Side, make sure you pop in before 6 P.M. Any time after that, you'll need to go all the way down to Alec Baldwin's apartment in the Village, where the line is often around the block.

Don't eat street food that has been made from old hot-dog carts.

New Yorkers are notorious for always being on the go, which is one of the reasons that food trucks and carts are so popular here. When visiting the city, by all means sample some of the street food, but watch out for any vender whose fare is, in fact, a piece of crushed metal that was formerly part of an old hot-dog cart. The warning signs are easy to spot: the ""food"" will often have a shred of a yellow hot-dog stand umbrella sticking out of it, and, upon taking a bite, you will notice that all of your teeth have fallen out and that your mouth is bleeding.

If there's an empty subway car, don't get in—it's privately owned by Donald Trump.

When you see an empty subway car, you might think that you've hit the jackpot and will be guaranteed a seat. In fact, these empty subway cars are an extension of Trump's real-estate empire, and you will be fined heavily for entering them.

When renting a Citi Bike, consider riding it across the Brooklyn Bridge's suspension cables.

Citi Bikes are a fun way to see New York City, and to work off some of the calories from all the food you'll eat here! If you'd like to get out of Manhattan and check out the artsy bohemian scene in Brooklyn, one of the best ways to get there is along the top of the Brooklyn Bridge's famous suspension cables. You'll get a beautiful view of the city, the Statue of Liberty, and a crowd of people beneath you, screaming and calling the police."
http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/how-one-of-the-last-american-typewriter-companies-survives,newyorker,A Prisoner’s Only Writing Machine,[],"Kenneth Foster, Jr., became a writer on death row. When he was nineteen, he drove three friends to two armed robberies in San Antonio, Texas; late that night, one of the friends shot and killed a man. Foster was in the car, approximately eighty feet away, but, under the Texas Law of Parties, he was convicted, in 1996, of capital murder. (Foster, like more than a third of the prisoners executed in Texas, is African-American.) He started writing a few years later, after he watched correctional officers forcibly remove a prisoner from his cell. “This man was gassed, wrestled down, cuffed and dragged to his fate,” he told me recently, in a letter. The prisoner was executed by lethal injection, and Foster began to grasp that, one day, the same thing would happen to him. He needed to share what he saw and felt. “I have written with everything from pen, typewriter, marker, to my own blood,” he explained. “I have written on tables, floors, on walls when I only had a crack of light, in the dark, under blinding lights.” He bought his first typewriter, a Smith Corona, around 1999, and he began writing letter after letter in an effort to stop his execution, which was set for August 30, 2007. The state kept death-row prisoners in solitary confinement, or “seg,” and, alone in his cell, Foster began to think of his typewriter as a companion. He recalled: Regardless that I’ve had countless of these cheap machines each one is “baby.” The receiver of my affection and attention. Without “her” I didn’t feel complete. With “her” I felt like I was on a DELL in an office somewhere in upper Manhattan. While guys spent time in these Seg cells calling out chess moves over the walkways or doing push-ups until their veins bulged from their temples, I was in my cell pecking away trying to create a different world for myself. Some kind of way I felt I could rewrite my future. In Texas, before prisoners are put to death, the seven-member Board of Pardons and Paroles reviews their applications for clemency one last time. On August 30th, Foster saw his wife and grandfather, and, in a small act of protest against capital punishment, he refused to eat a final meal. Then his father arrived. “Six to one!” he shouted, ecstatic. The board had read Foster’s typewritten application and voted to recommend that his death sentence be commuted to life in prison. An hour later, Governor Rick Perry called off the execution. Foster said that as soon as he was sent back to a prison cell, he resumed writing. In the years that followed, many prisons began to regulate typewriters. When Foster’s typewriter broke a few years ago, he discovered that the commissary stocked only clear-plastic machines made by Swintec. This model often broke, he said, but he depended on it. “Buttons stop working, centering goes off,” he told me. It costs two hundred and twenty-five dollars. “That’s a ludicrous price to pay for such junk, but for a person that produces as much material as myself it is absolutely necessary.”

Just across I-95 from New York City, in a light-industrial patch of Moonachie, New Jersey, a one-story building houses the headquarters of the Swintec Corporation, the nation’s sole supplier of clear typewriters. Eighty-five people used to work in the office; fewer than ten do today. Among them is Ed Michael, Swintec’s prison-sales manager. He joined the company in 1985. “We didn’t think about the prison market until the early two-thousands,” he told me. “We had no sense of the amount of business that was available.” Swintec started out as a supplier of office devices like shredders and adding machines, but the rise of personal computing cut deeply into its profits. Then Swintec employees realized that PCs weren’t making it into prisons: few American prisons permit computers, and many require that electronics be constructed out of transparent plastic, to prevent inmates from hiding contraband inside. “It was a breakthrough,” Michael told me. At corrections conferences, guards confirmed that clear-plastic typewriters would reduce the need for tedious inspections. “It was good for them, good for us.” More than two million people are incarcerated in the United States; they represent an immense and literally captive market. In total, states spend more than fifty billion dollars a year on their correctional systems, much of which goes to private companies in the form of contracts for construction, food, medical services, phone lines, and products sold to inmates. Swintec typewriters sell modestly, on the order of three thousand to five thousand machines per year, Michael said. Each costs roughly the same as a cheap laptop. But, unlike laptops, typewriters also consume a steady stream of supplies. One catalogue sent to prisons across the U.S. sells ribbons (eight dollars), correction tape (fourteen dollars for a six-pack), and printwheels (forty-nine dollars). The handful of inmates with whom I corresponded all told me that few people in prison can afford Swintec typewriters. In that catalogue, they’re the most expensive item for sale. (A clear-plastic television is as much as eighty dollars cheaper than the cheapest Swintec.) Wages for incarcerated people can generally be measured in cents per hour. “We don’t feel that our machine is overpriced,” Michael told me, citing the costs of developing special features like spell-check and cut-and-paste. He wouldn’t say how much Swintec spends to manufacture its machines, which are shipped in from factories in Indonesia and Japan, but he did say that the company profits when prisons specifically approve their devices. “A lot of states will mandate that their inmates can only buy those types of machines,” he said. That’s one reason that a typewriter company can survive in the era of smartphones. I asked Tom Furrier, a typewriter repairman in Arlington, Massachusetts, what he thought of the price of Swintec machines, which he occasionally sells and repairs. “It might as well be a thousand dollars, to some people,” he said. “But I don’t think the cost is outrageous, by any means.” Hundreds of old-fashioned typewriters sit on shelves in Furrier’s shop. I asked him why prisoners couldn’t use refurbished machines like that. “You could almost fashion anything out of these pieces,” he told me, pointing to the steel lever arms of an Underwood. “It would be lethal, I’m sure. Almost any part in this machine.”

John J. Lennon, who is serving twenty-eight years to life for a 2001 murder, used a Swintec typewriter to become a journalist in prison. When I visited him recently, at Sing Sing Correctional Facility, in Ossining, New York, he told me that he traded his first typewriter to another prisoner for drugs. But eventually he joined a writer’s workshop run by a Hamilton College professor, Doran Larson, and a Swintec helped him write about his life: the man he killed; a stabbing he survived; the mother who had, through everything, continued to support him. Lennon’s cell has no chair, so, until recently, he would sit on an upturned bucket next to the bed, upon which he would place the typewriter. Lately, on account of back pain, he sits on the bed and rests his typewriter on his lap. “You’ll hear my typewriter going all day,” he said. Lennon’s Swintec allows him to save a maximum of seven thousand characters. “You have to get the first four pages solid, delete, then start the next four,” he told me. During periods when his typewriter is broken, he writes letters by hand, in a neat cursive scrawl. A few years ago, he asked a fellow-prisoner to tattoo a typewriter on his arm. In 2013, Lennon wrote an essay arguing that gun-control laws could have stopped him from buying the assault rifle that he had used for murder. “Despite the Xanax dulling my emotions, my heart pounded when I picked up the M-16,” he typed. “A surge of power rushed through me when I felt the trigger.” He mailed the piece to a few magazines; The Atlantic published it on its Web site. “It’s a high when you get something published,” he told me. During our conversation, he started one sentence with, “When I’m out, maybe working for a magazine.” Around us, parents played Scrabble with their incarcerated sons, and children drank soda with their incarcerated fathers. “Hopefully my third act is a little sexier than my second,” he said. Others have achieved what Lennon aspires to. In 2003, Daniel Genis, a Russian-American in his early twenties, was arrested for a string of robberies in Manhattan. In prison he wrote “Narcotica,” a novel about drug addiction, on a Swintec, and since his release he has written about incarceration for Vice and the Daily Beast. But such stories are rare. During my visit to Swintec headquarters, Ed Michael told me about Stanley (Tookie) Williams, III, a gang member who killed four people in Southern California. Michael seemed moved by the fact that, while on death row in California, Williams used a Swintec to write books for children. I asked what happened to him. “They finalized his sentence,” Michael said. “They did it. Yeah. So he’s not there anymore.”"
http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/a-joyfully-defiant-us-mens-national-team-takes-the-gold-cup,newyorker,A Joyfully Defiant U.S. Men’s National Team Takes the Gold Cup,[],"The Gold Cup is not the most prestigious of soccer tournaments. The winner moves on to represent the CONCACAF region—countries from North America, Central America, and the Caribbean—at the quadrennial Confederations Cup, a dress rehearsal, of sorts, for the World Cup. For many countries, the Gold Cup is primarily an opportunity for coaches to observe young and fringe players in the hopes of strengthening their teams for the big show.

For the United States, however, this year’s tournament took on a little extra significance. Last November, the men’s national team struggled through the final round of World Cup qualifying, losing in heartbreaking fashion to Mexico and then getting thoroughly embarrassed a few days later by Costa Rica. That left the United States at the bottom of the region’s World Cup qualifying table. Coach Jürgen Klinsmann was fired, and replaced by Bruce Arena, whose largely unruffled disposition sits in contrast to a more excitable Klinsmann, and who coached the national team for several years in the late nineties and early two-thousands. Arena was supposed to restore the confidence of the American players, believed by many to have dwindled during Klinsmann’s bumpy tenure.

On Wednesday, in Santa Clara, California, the U.S. faced off against Jamaica in the Gold Cup final. The Jamaicans, dubbed the Reggae Boyz, were the tournament’s upstarts, advancing farther than anyone expected, thanks to talented youngsters and the magisterial performances of the goalkeeper Andre Blake. The match remained deadlocked for most of the first half, until the forty-fifth minute, when the veteran striker Jozy Altidore put the U.S. ahead on a free kick from about thirty yards out. Altidore, a longtime fixture on the national team, has struggled in recent years to make his mark in a major tournament, thanks to recurring hamstring injuries. But when the referee blew his whistle for the free kick, he steadied himself, took two steps toward the ball, and struck it with force and composure. The ball curled around a wall of four Jamaican defenders, ascending and bending toward the left side of the goal, and past the outstretched arms of Dwayne Miller, Jamaica’s backup goalkeeper. (Blake was taken off the field with an injured hand in the nineteenth minute of the game.) Altidore thumped the U.S. crest on the left side of his jersey.

Altidore, whose parents came to the United States from Haiti, is one of many sons of immigrants on the U.S. team. There’s Omar Gonzalez, whose parents are from Mexico; Matt Miazga, the son of Polish immigrants; Darlington Nagbe, born in Liberia; and Juan Agudelo, who was born in Colombia. Watching them celebrate, I thought of the kids I had seen the day before playing soccer at a park near my home, in Washington, D.C. Their foreheads glistened in the afternoon sun, their brown bodies moved with the raucous howl of their adolescent voices. With the promise of that pluralism seemingly under siege as of late, the rejoicing of the men’s team felt almost defiant.

Jamaica bounced back in the fiftieth minute with a splendid goal by Je-Vaughn Watson, who had jostled his way free from the U.S. forward Jordan Morris to volley home a corner kick. Morris looked visibly distraught, his man having evaded his mark, but he found redemption in the game’s closing minutes. After a cross from Gyasi Zardes bounced around the box, Morris pounced on the ball from about sixteen yards out and powered a shot past Miller in the goalbox to give the U.S the lead again. Morris giddily sprinted to the sideline, where his teammates encircled him, jumping up and down with unbridled joy.

There are tough World Cup qualifying matches to come: the team must win a slate of contests to secure a trip to an eighth consecutive World Cup, in Russia, in 2018. For one evening, though, regardless of the larger significance—or insignificance—of the Gold Cup, we could celebrate a team that looks like the country we are quickly becoming, and perhaps the country we have always been."
http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/empty-east-versus-west-espionage-in-atomic-blonde,newyorker,Empty East-Versus-West Espionage in “Atomic Blonde”,[],"The last days of the Berlin Wall—the protests in East Berlin in the autumn of 1989, and the first efforts at its physical demolition—are the backdrop of “Atomic Blonde,” a mainly insubstantial and unengaging spy action-drama. It’s a story with a double MacGuffin. A Briton named Gascoigne has a big, heavy watch that contains a list of all the Western agents in East Berlin. The K.G.B. wants it, and kills him to get it. Charlize Theron plays Lorraine Broughton, an M.I.6 agent who’s sent to East Berlin to get it back—and also to spirit out a turncoat Stasi agent (Eddie Marsan), code name Spyglass, who has memorized the contents of the list and whom the K.G.B. is pursuing as well. Lorraine, arriving in the guise of an attorney empowered to identify and claim Gascoigne’s body, connects with her local British colleague (James McAvoy), who helps her to plunge into the shattered prism of deceptive identities at the heart of the spy-versus-spy violence. Along the way, she gets entangled with a French agent (Sofia Boutella) who, borrowing a stereotype, has an artistic streak.

There’s one twist, though: the Cold War action centered around the autumn of 1989 is seen in flashbacks, framed by the confrontational debriefing of Lorraine by two high officials, one British (played by Toby Jones) and the other American (John Goodman)—and that debriefing finds Lorraine wounded and bruised, both physically and emotionally. Though Lorraine has survived her new mission, these bloody tangles show that her survival comes at a heavy price. The movie is not exactly a mashup of genres but a grafting of a current style—in effect, the Hollywood martial-arts movie—onto an utterly overfamiliar Cold War spy story. And, unfortunately, it reflects the very familiarity of its plot and the unoriginality of the director David Leitch, a longtime stuntman and stunt coördinator who also served as an uncredited co-director of “John Wick.”

An action film is something like a classic musical, in which the drama is punctuated by production numbers that relate, to varying degrees, to the substance of the plot. With “Atomic Blonde,” of course, the action is integral to the plot, even in its stylized choreography. Even though the plot is unimportant—the East-versus-West espionage is just a trampoline for vertiginous tumbles—it’s nonetheless essential to whatever emotional kick the fight stunts offer. Unlike a movie such as “ Dunkirk ,” which resounds from start to finish with the intended profundity of its moral substance, “Atomic Blonde” deals with big things simply, clearly, trivially—it dramatizes, with plot twists, the effort by American, British, and French agents to help people living behind the Iron Curtain achieve freedom.

The terms of that freedom are set in stark documentary terms, through the ominous and oppressive presence of the Wall, which, of course, didn’t keep Westerners out but kept residents of the East in. It’s set in stark moral terms, too, particularly in a scene showing local officers holding rock-and-roll-loving, skateboarding teens as hostages, humiliated, berated, and tortured by an East German officer. The movie has nothing unusual to say about life in the East, nothing substantial to suggest about the conflict, which is depicted as a problem of temperamentally decent people forced to do ugly things in order to resist the forces of evil.

Yet there is a remarkable scene, midway through the film, that captures a tone, an idea, a mood that shades the sharp edges of the geopolitical conflict, which infuses the movie with a whiff of Ostalgia —nostalgia for the East. It’s a scene that’s set in the center of town, in or near Alexanderplatz, in an industrial-cold cinematheque that’s showing Andrei Tarkovsky’s 1979 film “ Stalker ” (which was restored and reissued here earlier this year), which is itself an elaborate and frenzied allegory of the differences between East and West. There, Lorraine has a meeting that soon turns to chaos and violence, but that’s already beside the point. “Stalker” is a cinematic masterwork, a work of art in an entirely different vein than “Atomic Blonde.” It is, not to put too fine a point on it, less “fun.”

The sublimely, ecstatically anguished “Stalker,” which tells of mind-bending forces and life-and-death escapes, brings to mind the Philip Roth remark about the difference between the two realms: for writers in the West, everything goes and nothing matters; for those in the East, nothing goes and everything matters. Meanwhile, the view of the movie-palace architecture and the brute urbanism of the Soviet-era version of Alexanderplatz depicts the charming charmlessness of the slightly and poorly adorned, calculatedly unrefined architecture of the East—the architectural equivalent of bad haircuts and bad suits, the inverted cool of the hopelessly styleless. The scene is a step away from an Iron Curtain “Napoleon Dynamite,” but with that film’s sweet-hearted humanity replaced by a grotesque simulacrum of humanism enforced with cruelty. Brutalist architecture here fully earns its name.

There is one other terrific, surprising moment in the film: a scene near the end, in which a seemingly haphazard crowd in a public place engages in a shocking bit of carefully planned, simultaneous action. It’s actually very similar to a climactic riff in “ John Wick: Chapter 2 ,” and, exactly as in that film, the effect, despite the momentary flash of wonder that it provides, is far less fascinating than one imagines any backroom meeting to plan it would have been. “Atomic Blonde” is a movie of process that completely elides its process. Who are these people, and how do they become what they are? What kind of temperament does it take to save an idea, an ideal, an alliance from its enemies? As recent movies about warriors go, “ American Sniper ” is great at suggesting the temperament and the training that make a masterful one; the short answer is that it isn’t pretty. As classics go, Howard Hawks’s “Sergeant York,” the movie at which “American Sniper” winked, was nearly all backstory, a movie about the thick local and cultural background of someone who became a reluctant war hero. (Backstory is democracy in drama—it turns types into individuals.)

Yes, “Atomic Blonde” is, at least in a marketable way, more “fun” than “Stalker” (though it’s safe to say that Leitch’s film won’t break any box-office records, as Tarkovsky’s film did in its recent re-release). It’s a movie that has it both ways; it shows how the sausage of freedom is made, with gory battles behind the façades of public life—but it turns that gory combat into a new façade, another illusion that hides still others that are far more complex, troubling, and unresolved. Leitch’s film posits the very terms of Western-style freedom, and of the fun that it fosters and purveys, as this blissful state of not knowing—or, rather, it poses this not knowing as a blissful state."
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/24/the-life-of-a-south-central-statistic,newyorker,The Life of a South Central Statistic,[],"We, who are in prison, had to answer for our sins and our lives were taken from us. Our bodies became the property of the state of California. We are reduced to numbers and stripped of our identity. To the state of California I am not Michael Alexander Allen but I am K-10033. When they want to know anything about me they do not type my last name in the computer but it is my number that is inputted. My number is my name. . . . Dante was not in hell due to a fatal sin but somewhere in his life he strayed onto the path of error, away from his true self. I, K-10033, strayed away from my true self: Michael Alexander Allen.

What sets the course of a life? Three years before my beloved cousin’s murder—before the weeping, before the raging, before the heated self-recriminations and icy reckonings—I awoke with the most glorious sense of anticipation I’ve ever felt. It was June 29, 2006, the day that Michael was going to be freed. Outside my vacation condo in Hollywood, I climbed into the old white BMW I’d bought from my mother and headed to my aunt’s small stucco home, in South Central. On the corner, a fortified drug house stood like a sentry, but her pale cottage seemed serene, aglow in the morning sun. Poverty never looks quite as bad in the City of Angels as it does elsewhere. Aunt Karen, my father’s youngest sister, then drove a crew of us to collect Michael from the California Rehabilitation Center-Norco, which lies on a dusty stretch of Riverside County. Michael, the youngest of her three kids, was born when I was eight years old. I had grown up with him. The baby of a sprawling family, he was also my baby, a child of magnetizing energy and good humor. We had lost him eleven years earlier, when he was arrested, at fifteen, for an attempted carjacking. Now we’d get him back. It felt like a resurrection. At the parking lot for Tower 8, a white van drove up to deposit the prisoners being released. Michael stepped out, saw us, and smiled. His broad, toothy grin took up half his face, a bright flash of white against his dark skin. He had a little bob in his step, the same natural spring he’d had as a child. His late adolescence and early adulthood had been spent in captivity, yet he bounded toward us like a fawn. The homecoming party was in the driveway of my aunt’s house, next to the postage stamp of a lawn. Uncles and friends, cousins and second cousins, and cousins who knows how many times removed pulled folding chairs up to folding tables, which were covered with paper tablecloths and laden with fried chicken and sweet tea. The merriment continued all afternoon, and seemed to attract some attention from the neighbors. More than once, a glamorous-looking woman drove past, slowly, in a low-slung two-door gold Mercedes sports car. Michael feasted and played Football Manager with the nephews and nieces who had been born while he was in prison. After the party, we had little time to waste. That summer, I was telecommuting to my job as the dean of the humanities at the University of Chicago. Michael, for his part, was intent on making something of himself. He had spent some time as a firefighter when he was at Norco, and he was ready to rebuild his life. Making that happen, managing his reëntry in the months to come, was my job. Not mine alone, but mine consistently, day after day, as the cousin on duty, the one with resources, the one who had been to college and who had become a professional. The plans we had were not the plans we had hoped to have. Michael should have been paroled to a fire camp or to a fire station in Riverside County, where we had family who were ready to take him in. He could have lived there and gone to school and kept on beating back wildfires. But the rule was that you had to be paroled to the county where your offense was committed—crime-ridden Los Angeles County, in his case. So we developed the best alternatives we could. We made task lists, and moved through them efficiently. We met the parole officer, opened a bank account, and went to the library, where Michael got a card and started learning how to use a computer. (Google hadn’t existed when he went to prison.) At the D.M.V., he took a test and got his driver’s license. Then, under the scorching sun of the deadliest California heat wave in nearly sixty years, we returned each day to the cool library and scoured Web sites for jobs. We focussed on large chains, which would have room for advancement, and sent out a lot of applications. Most of the time, Michael never got a reply. Then he caught a break: Sears invited him to a job interview. One morning in late July, he donned a new pair of khaki trousers and a button-down shirt, and we headed to Hollywood, to Santa Monica and Western. It was the perfect opportunity—but also, to me, a fraught one. A man who had been imprisoned for more than a decade would have to make the case that he ought to be hired. We had practiced bits and pieces of his story, but never the whole thing. In fact, I never heard Michael recount his own tale from start to finish. I wonder now whether this was because the full version would have led me to ask questions that Michael did not want to answer. He had so much to give—stories, reflection, engagement—that somehow none of us ever noticed just how much he was withholding. He could love everybody on the terms on which they needed to be loved, give everybody what they needed to receive; and so, in the end, none of us really knew him. I’ve come to realize that he didn’t quite know himself, either.

The trouble began in preadolescence. His mother got married to a man who had kept from her the fact that he had a criminal record, and who soon became abusive. Karen took her children to Mississippi and then to southern Georgia. There, a few months shy of twelve, Michael stole a jar of coins, amounting to something under ten dollars, from a white family across the street. He was starting to want things, impatiently, and he was also naïve, a California kid transplanted to the Deep South. Only out of naïveté could he have thought to steal from a white family in southern Georgia. Rather than telling Karen and asking for the money back, the family pressed charges. It was Michael’s first encounter with the law, and he went to court with his mother. Karen had by then filed for divorce and bought plane tickets to California. The judge told her the charges would be dropped so long as they got on the plane and never came back. In the fall of 1991, Michael and his family moved to Claremont, where my father, William, taught, and where my mother, Susan, worked as a college librarian. For my cousins, my parents’ house was a second home, screened with laurel bushes, framed by pink-blossomed crêpe myrtles, and shaded by a spreading loquat tree in front. “Everything is dandy—and our intestinal biomes are joyous.” William and Karen—children of a Florida fisherman who became a charismatic Baptist preacher—were close, but their courses in life were not. My father, with the encouragement of a grade-school teacher, was academically ambitious, and he turned into a pipe-smoking, NPR-listening professor, a political scientist who chaired the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. He spent much of his days amid heaps of paper in a book-filled study, orchestral harmonies from the radio perfumed by the tweedy, comforting smell of pipe tobacco. Karen’s story was different; she worked for a time as a certified nursing assistant, but bringing up three young kids while working full time was a struggle. Her ex-husband wasn’t the first abusive man she had been involved with, and plans for furthering her education were often derailed. Now, with my brother and me away at college, my parents helped Karen find an apartment a few blocks away. Michael took piano lessons from a stern, diminutive woman who had been my own teacher and who taught us how to sit up straight, “like the Queen of England.” Michael earned money gardening for her, but resented the hectoring lessons about life that she delivered as he weeded. He was becoming something of a rule breaker in Claremont. He and his new friend Adam were caught stealing chocolate-chip cookies from the school cafeteria, and sometimes had to be separated after making noise in class. Michael was also caught shoplifting at a nearby mall. Luckily, the store owner delivered Michael to my father, not to the police. But Michael’s pattern of petty theft worried his mother, and my father; the weeding job was meant to deal with his need for money. Then, in early 1993, a fire swept through the family’s apartment complex, and they moved again, to the L.A. neighborhood of Inglewood. Although the area was scarred from the ravages of the previous year’s riots, the move meant that Karen could be closer to her new job, at an organization called Homeless Health Care Los Angeles. It also meant that Michael started a new school year in yet another district. We know something about his experiences as a student, because the State of California surveyed its youth during the 1993-94 school year. Forty per cent of ninth graders reported being in a physical fight; nearly sixty per cent reported seeing someone at school with a weapon. Gangs filled in for family; almost one in five ninth graders reported belonging to one at some point. Michael, then just shy of fourteen, seems to have flirted with the Queen Street Bloods, who were active on the west side of Inglewood; later, he started hanging with a friend from the Crips, a rival gang. Michael was testing out a new world. But in that summer of 1993 he would also return to his old one, riding a bus back to Claremont to hang out with Adam. During one of those visits, Adam’s parents were looking after the next-door neighbor’s house, and the two boys let themselves in and took a radio and some other items. The neighbor reported a burglary, and when Karen realized who was responsible she hauled Michael to the police station. The boys returned everything. They were given a two-year juvenile probation, which entailed a curfew but no court date. The narrative so far is familiar. A kid from a troubled home, trapped in poverty, without a stable world of adults coördinating care for him, starts pilfering, mostly out of an impatience to have things. In Michael’s first fourteen years, his story includes not a single incidence of violence, aside from the usual wrestling matches with siblings. It could have had any number of possible endings. But events unfold along a single track. As we make decisions, and decisions are made for us, we shed the lives that might have been. In Michael’s fifteenth year, his life accelerated, like a cylinder in one of those pneumatic tubes, whisking off your deposit at a drive-through bank. To understand how that acceleration could happen, though, another story is needed. • Like Dante I am forced to descend lower into hell to achieve a full awakening. I am forced into depression, scarred by obscenities, war after war, but each war that I survive I am a step closer to a full awakening of self. My hell is no longer demonstrating what I am capable of doing in order to survive. It has become what I can tolerate and withstand in order to live.

Consider the visible surface of Los Angeles. Underpasses, bridges, alleyways, delivery trucks, service entrances, corner stores, mailboxes, water towers, exhaust vents, and the streets—in the nineties, at least, all were covered with graffiti. Few can read that graffiti. I couldn’t then, and have only now begun to learn how to decipher it. But it’s a language that represents a world. It records deaths and transactions, benefactions and trespasses, favors done and owed, vendettas pursued. Laws and punishments. If you can’t read that graffiti, you have no conception of the parallel universe, all around you, that is fundamentally at war with the legally recognized state. It’s a regime with its own rules and penalties—in effect, a parastate. Michael grew up there. Behind that parastate’s economy and criminal-justice system lies the war on drugs. In the eighties, as the state sought to break the global drug-supply chain by rounding up low-level peddlers and deterring them with outsized penalties, the wholesalers established their own system of deterrence for gang members who served as retailers. If you didn’t do what you were supposed to do, you were shot. Maybe in the knee first. If you riled the gang system again, you or someone you loved might be killed. The drug business, dependent on a well-established witness-suppression program, operates a far more powerful system of deterrence, with far swifter punishment, than any lawful state could ever devise. In these years, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department created its first gang database. In 1988, after a much publicized drive-by shooting of a bystander, near U.C.L.A., the Los Angeles Police Department used the database to round up no fewer than fourteen hundred African-American youths and detain them in the parking lot of the L.A. Coliseum. More than eighteen thousand people were jailed in six months. Between 1982 and 1995, the African-American prison population in California grew from 12,470 to 42,296; the Latino prison population soared from 9,006 to 46,080. Los Angeles was a city ready to explode when the four police officers who had been caught on video beating Rodney King were acquitted. When Michael stole the jar of coins in Georgia, and the judge dropped the charges, you might say that Michael met the “forgiving world.” The same happened when he shoplifted, and when he stole the radio in Claremont, in 1993. But, back in the City of Angels, Michael met the unforgiving world. Nearly half the black men in Los Angeles between the ages of twenty-one and twenty-four were officially identified as gang members, and this simple fact of classification, accurate or not, affected that community profoundly. The angels had turned their backs. The summer before Michael’s junior year, in 1995, he began looking for a job. His cousin Marc—my younger brother—had worked in a grocery store as a bag boy throughout high school, and Michael wanted a similar gig. But, at fifteen, he needed a work permit, and nobody in his mother’s social network could help. He again began to roam the streets, and stayed out past his curfew. In math class, his grades plunged from straight A’s to an F. Karen had conferences with Michael and his teachers, who told him that he was smarter than this. He countered, “I don’t want to be smarter than this.” On those warm summer days, he spent as much time as he could out-of-doors. Sometimes he would stand in front of the house of a kid he’d come to know. Karen spotted him once, lean and muscled, standing shirtless in khaki trousers—gangbanging gear. Although he was only four blocks away from her apartment, it felt like a different neighborhood. the relative best equipped to guide Michael’s reëntry. Photograph by Matthew Tammaro for The New Yorker Karen’s last day with her boy was Friday, September 15th. Michael didn’t have school. He went to work with his mother and hung out in her office. Then she took him to the Los Angeles Public Library, where she planned to meet him when she got off work, to take him shopping. But Michael was gone when she returned. The next time she saw him, he was in handcuffs.

Where were you when you were fifteen? When I close my eyes, I can still see a bedroom with a brass bed topped with a blue-and-white striped Laura Ashley comforter. There were matching valences on my windows, and I had a wooden rolltop desk, with a drawer that locked and held my secrets, including dirty letters that I couldn’t at the time translate from a German boy with whom I’d had a minor romance at summer music camp. I grew up in a college town where everyone knew my parents. They had made a critical decision, early in the lives of their two children, not to move until we had graduated from high school. I was a faculty brat, an insecure and often lonely child; the only time I ever got grounded was when my mother caught me sneaking a ride to French class with a friend. I was younger than most of my classmates at Claremont High School, and, although my friends all had their driver’s licenses by the start of our junior year and I didn’t, I wasn’t allowed to ride in their cars. Eight years later, in L.A., my fifteen-year-old cousin, who also didn’t yet have a driver’s license, was arrested, for the first time, for an attempted carjacking. It was September 17, 1995, a cool and foggy Sunday morning. Larry Smith, a lanky forty-four-year-old, was buffing the dashboard of his blue Cadillac Coupe de Ville in the alley behind his apartment, on Rosecrans Avenue. The street was lined with drab stucco apartment buildings, whose uncovered staircases led down to carports below. Michael appeared holding a chrome Lorcin .380, a cheap pistol prone to malfunction. An older friend, Devonn, a member of the Rollin 60s Crips, was apparently on lookout, but not visible to Smith as he worked in his car. (Both names have been changed.) Michael approached Smith, told him not to move, and demanded his watch. Smith handed it over. Then Michael asked for his wallet. When he found that it was empty, he tossed it back into the car. Then, as the police report recounted, Michael “tapped Smith’s left knee with the gun and said he was going to take the car.” According to Smith, Michael kept the gun pointed at the ground. Smith lunged for the weapon. They wrestled. Michael punched him. Smith gained control of the gun and shot Michael through the neck. As Michael lay bleeding on the ground, Smith hollered to his wife to call 911. When the police arrived, they collected evidence and looked for witnesses, although no one had anything to say. Meanwhile, paramedics took Michael to a hospital, where he was treated for a “through and through” bullet wound that had narrowly missed his spine. A police officer accompanying Michael in the ambulance reported that, “during transport, Allen made a spontaneous statement that he was robbing a man when he got shot.” At the hospital, Michael was read his Miranda rights and additional juvenile admonishments in the presence of a second officer. According to the police report, he waived his rights and said again that he had tried to rob the man, using a gun that he claimed he had found about two and a half weeks earlier. He also confessed that he had robbed three people during the previous two days on the same block, and that he had robbed someone a week earlier, about ten blocks away. The police had no reports for two of the four robberies he confessed to; in the two that had been reported, Michael had taken twenty dollars from one victim and two dollars from another. In other words, on his way to the hospital, and upon admission, with no adults present other than the officers, a wounded fifteen-year-old talked a blue streak. By the time Karen got to Michael’s bedside, he had wrapped up his confession. The only thing he didn’t mention was Devonn’s involvement. Did Devonn suggest the crime, or provide the gun? We have no way of knowing. I don’t believe that Michael was prepared, that morning, to be violent; he had a gun, but refrained from using it. Still, I was far away, a graduate student in England. Along the banks of the River Cam, I shared poems with friends and debated crime and punishment in ancient Athens. I had gravitated toward the subject upon being struck by how a sophisticated, democratic society had made next to no use of imprisonment. When the news of Michael’s arrest came, it was stupefying. My brain raced in endless loops. How could it be ? How could it be ? I now have a sense of an answer. But there were harder questions ahead. • I’m trapped in a hell with whom society decrees to be the worst of living and better off dead. Robbers, rapists, child molesters, carjackers, murderers, and dope fiends who would spend their mother’s monthly rent for a quick fix. And here I am, amongst them. As much as the mere thought disgusts me, I am one of them. Just another number, not deserving of a second chance.

Before his arrest, Michael did not have a criminal record. That day, he gained one with a vengeance. For the watch and the wallet, Michael was charged with robbery; for the car, attempted carjacking. Both charges were “enhanced” because of the gun. He was also charged with the two earlier robberies. Four felonies, two from one incident, and all in one week. Eighteen months earlier, in March, 1994, California’s Three Strikes and You’re Out law, the nation’s first, had gone into effect. Once you were convicted of your third felony, it meant twenty-five years to life, or a plea deal. If Michael pursued a jury trial, convictions on at least three of his four charges would trigger the law. Worse, this was happening at the high point of L.A.’s panic about carjackings. In Los Angeles County alone, the number of carjackings had nearly doubled between 1991 and 1992, from 3,600 to 6,297. In 1993, the state legislature had unanimously passed a bill that made carjacking an offense for which sixteen-year-olds could be tried as adults. Two years later, the bar was lowered to fourteen. A Los Angeles Times article titled “Wave of Fear,” which ran the year before Michael’s arrest, quoted then Senator Joseph Biden saying, “Name me a person in L.A. who has a fender-bender and doesn’t fear an imminent carjacking. Yes, it’s still remote, but you’re in the statistical pool now. It’s like AIDS . Everyone’s in the pool now.” California’s legislators had given up on the idea of rehabilitation in prison, even for juveniles. This is a point that critics of the penal system make all the time. Here is what they don’t say: legislators had also given up on retribution. Anger drives retribution. When the punishment fits the crime, retribution is achieved, and anger is sated; it softens. This is what makes it anger, not hatred, a distinction recognized by philosophers all the way back to antiquity. Retribution limits how much punishment you can impose. “Mommy and Daddy still love you, but we’re going to try living thirteen inches apart for a while.” The legislators who voted to try as adults sixteen-year-olds, and then fourteen-year-olds, were not interested in retribution. They had become deterrence theorists. They were designing sentences not for people but for a thing: the aggregate level of crime. They wanted to reduce that level, regardless of what constituted justice for any individual involved. The target of Michael’s sentence was not a bright fifteen-year-old boy with a mild proclivity for theft but the thousands of carjackings that occurred in Los Angeles. Deterrence dehumanizes. It directs at the individual the full hatred that society understandably has for an aggregate phenomenon. But no individual should bear that kind of responsibility. On February 5, 1996, four and a half months after Michael’s last night at home, he sat in court, in an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs, as the judge told him to choose whether to stand trial and face a possible conviction of twenty-five years to life or to plead guilty and take a reduced sentence. The judge didn’t say how much the sentence would be reduced, but he did say, “Please take the plea.” Michael could not choose. Now sixteen, he asked his mother to decide. Karen went outside the courtroom and prayed. “God told me,” she says, “that he would only get seven years, versus risking a trial of twenty-five years to life. I made the decision.” So Michael pleaded guilty. A few months later, he learned that his “earliest possible release date” was June 29, 2006. According to Karen, the only time Michael cried in court was when he got sentenced. When you’re sixteen, the farthest back you can remember is about thirteen years, to the age of three. Michael’s sentence was almost equivalent, in psychological terms, to the whole of his life. It stretched past what was for him the limit of knowable time. The mind cannot fasten onto this sort of temporality; we are unable to give it concrete meaning in relation to our own lives. The imagination wanders into white space. For Michael, it was, he later wrote, “a mountain of time” to climb. It would be a steep one. The moment he turned seventeen, he was transferred to adult prison. “How could it have happened?” is the question everyone asks. Where were the lawyers? What did your family do? I think back to the stolen radio. Michael came from a family who believed that if you did something wrong you admitted it, you fixed it, and you suffered the consequences. Michael was guilty of the attempted carjacking; he was going to have to suffer the consequences. Our family trusted in the fairness of the criminal-justice system. At each turn, we learned too late that this system was no longer what we thought it was, that its grip was mercilessly tightening, that our son would be but one among many millions soon lost in its vise. When we read that the point of the Three Strikes law is to lock up repeat offenders, we do not think of the fifteen-year-old who has just been arrested for the first time. An underground nuclear test is conducted, and the land above craters only much later. This, I think, describes the effect of the Three Strikes law and the slow, constant escalation of penal severity. An explosion occurred underground. The people standing on the surface conducted their lives as usual. They figured out what was really going on only after the earth had collapsed beneath them.

The years between the ages of fifteen and twenty-six are punctuated by familiar milestones: high school, driver’s license, college, first love, first job, first serious relationship, perhaps marriage, possibly a child. For those who pass adolescence in prison, some of these rites disappear; the ones that occur take on a distorted shape. And extra milestones get added. First long-term separation from family. First racial melee. First time in solitary, formally known as “administrative segregation.” First time sodomized. Between his arrest and his sentencing, Michael was mainly in Central, the juvenile prison, where only parents and legal guardians could visit. When Michael and I reconnected properly, in the late nineties, he was making his way through Chino—a notoriously tough prison—before landing in Norco. Its full name was the California Rehabilitation Center-Norco, but little rehabilitation was on offer. There was the obligatory library, but no classes past the G.E.D. level. In the nineties, college and university classes were scrapped because of budget cuts, and the state and federal governments ceased providing prisoners access to Pell Grants for correspondence courses. Higher education, once seen as an antidote to recidivism, had come to be seen as a privilege that inmates hadn’t earned. After I started teaching at the University of Chicago, in 1998, Michael and I began talking regularly on the phone. Once he was at Norco, I began to visit him, too, every other week in the summer and during the Christmas holidays. Michael would call at least once a week, sometimes more, except when the prison was on lockdown owing to outbreaks of violence. Then weeks might pass without a word. I was a good phone partner, because I could afford the astronomical collect-call charges. Every call began with a reminder, a robotic voice saying, “This is the California Department of Corrections. Will you accept the charges?” And then, every fifteen seconds, as if we could forget, there was another interruption: “This call has originated from a California state prison.” Michael, who had already completed his G.E.D., desperately wanted to go to college, and I understood his desire to learn. I believed in education; I believed in Michael. So I researched how Michael might be able to get a college degree. On November 8, 2001, Michael sent me his application to Indiana University’s Program in General Studies, and I mailed it with a check nine days later. He would aim for a bachelor’s degree. The day he was admitted was as exhilarating as the day I received my fat envelope from Princeton, thirteen years earlier. There was a catch, however. No hardcover books were allowed into the prison. Michael could enroll only in classes for which the textbooks had soft covers. I made a round of phone calls. The remaining choices for introductory classes were Intro to Ethics and Intro to Writing and Study of Literature. Michael chose the second, Lit 141. I paid the fees and ordered the books. New Year’s came and so did the Bible, the Odyssey, the Inferno, “The Canterbury Tales,” and “Persian Letters.” But there was no shortage of distractions, and Michael had trouble completing the assignments. At one point, suspected of participating in a “racial melee,” he was transferred to Chino and placed in solitary, until an investigation absolved him. A year later, he repeated the class. This time he churned out one essay after another, with readings that were full of insight and personal connection to ancient texts. He was finding his voice. “I don’t take kindly to seeing myself in Hell but Dante’s writing makes it impossible to just read without visualization,” he wrote in one essay. “It is the life I live in Prison which to me is Hell. . . . I think of Dante’s use of ice as nothing but a mere deception. Ice within itself is enticing to the burning soul. Ice can get so cold that it burns flesh. And it’s parallel to any sin committed on earth.” “All right, boys, we’ve had our fun.” Along the way, Michael fell in love. I remember his words on the phone: “I’ve met someone, Danielle. She’s beautiful.” And I remember my sense of confusion. Met someone? How? Where? I was thinking of the female guards whom I’d got to know in the course of my visits. But in a fumbling way we came to understand each other. Michael had fallen in love with a fellow-inmate who had implants or hormone-induced breasts, and who dressed and lived as Bree. (I’ve changed the name.) She was, he said, unquestionably the most beautiful woman in the prison. He hadn’t told his mother, and he made me promise not to say anything. He knew Karen would be upset and he feared she would judge him, as he trusted I would not. Like freedom, desire was dizzying to Michael. A month later, he mailed me a piece of writing unlike anything he had ever sent me. “The world has change and brothas far from the same,” he rapped, and continued: Am I losing my mind No; I think I found it Realizing greatness in one’s self is very astounding and truth be told, I recognize a King cause when I look in the mirror all I see is me And us, so please trust, we can’t be touch standing together forever is a necessary must. Soon afterward, he sent me Bree’s annual prison shot. She was posed as a woman, lying on the floor like a sports pinup, made up and in colorful clothing. Why did he love her? He loved her because she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. He loved her because, of all the men in prison, she had chosen him—and that was a gift of surpassing value. But it was also a gift that came to blind him. When he was finally released from prison, I failed to grasp that he was not yet free.

Upstairs, in the Sears personnel department, everything was beige and brightly lit. I settled into a metal chair and waited while Michael had his interview, in an office down the hall. I did a lot of waiting that summer, but I never questioned why I was there. My brother and I had long ago formed a tight circle with Aunt Karen’s three kids—Nicholas, Roslyn, and Michael, each born about two years apart—and, as the oldest, I was always the one in charge. As I waited, I typically spent my time thinking about my task lists, about what had to be done next. Forty-five minutes into this particular wait, the door opened and I learned that the managers had offered Michael a job as an inventory clerk. It felt as if time had begun. I could imagine a future, even a happy ending. There was still school and housing to be arranged, but we were steadily assembling the pieces of a possible life, as if doing a jigsaw puzzle. The goal was for Michael to work full time and to enroll in one of California’s famed community colleges. No one in his immediate family had a degree, but I was in my element—pretty much my deepest expertise was in going to school. Los Angeles Valley College, in Valley Glen, was the obvious place, a decent school with good general-education courses and—our goal—a fire-technology program. The subway’s Red Line had stops at Santa Monica and Vermont, about a mile from the Sears, and in North Hollywood, not too far from campus. We battled our way through the thicket of federal financial-aid forms, visited the tutoring center, and hungrily collected flyers posting apartments for rent. We needed a place cheap enough to manage on Michael’s wages. Together, we searched the listings, drove by addresses, and made calls and appointments. We landed on a promising place on Ethel Avenue, in Valley Glen, a few blocks north of the college. The advertisement was for a studio apartment in a converted garage behind a modest home. Once again, Michael practiced telling his story, and we scheduled a visit. The home was impeccable, a white bungalow circled by a white iron fence. Alongside the fence stood some small shrubs, neatly tended, and rosebushes spraying white flowers. I went up to the house by myself. Two women met me at the door, a mother, perhaps in her sixties, and her daughter. Dressed in linen trousers and a black T-shirt, I introduced myself. I was a professor, I told them, and I was helping my cousin, who had recently been released from prison. He had just enrolled at Los Angeles Valley College and been hired at Sears. I would be paying his deposit and guaranteeing his rent. He’d been sentenced as a young person and this was his second chance. Were they willing to meet him and hear him out? They agreed, and I sat outside while Michael spoke to his prospective landlords. He could charm anyone with that bouncing gait and electric grin. Finally, the three emerged, in good spirits, and the women took us around to the back to see the studio. It was clean and peaceful, and equipped with a hot plate and an electric heater. I could imagine being comfortable there. And it was walking distance from the school. Michael said he wanted it; we all shook hands in the gaze of the late-afternoon sun. I was moved by the trust and the generosity of these two women, and I still am. Driving back to South Central, my mood was all melody. I imagined Michael felt the same. Little more than a month out and here he was, with a driver’s license, a bank account, a library card, and a job. He was enrolled in college, with a clean, safe, comfortable place to live. This was a starter set for a life, enabling him to defy the pattern of parolees. “Look, I did bring you in here for questioning. I want to know if you like my new tie.” I dropped him off in South Central and headed back to Hollywood, expecting to sleep soundly for the first time in a while. But that night Michael called. He wasn’t sure he should take the apartment. I felt a stone drop to the bottom of a well. Why not? I asked. He couldn’t explain, he said. He just didn’t feel quite right about it. I told him to sleep on it, and when we talked in the morning he told me he wanted the apartment after all. Relieved, I headed off to collect a cashier’s check for the security deposit, and Michael headed off under yet another cloudless sky to his job at Sears. At midday, he called me again: Had I taken the check over yet? He said that he had changed his mind again. “Michael, what on earth are you talking about?” He told me that he wasn’t sure what it would be like if his associates came by. The word surprised me, but I didn’t ask him what he meant by “associates.” The purpose of the word, somehow, was to insist on his privacy, and it brought me up short. I paused, didn’t ask questions. I told him to think about it some more. Disagreement was rare for us. He called me a few hours later. He said he would take the apartment and asked me to pick him up after work. Then, just before I did so, he called again. “I’ve made up my mind,” he said. “I don’t want the apartment.” My memory of the conversation is hazy, but it’s likely we exchanged some sharp words. His plan, it emerged, was to live with his mother and to ride the bus the nine miles from there to Sears and the ten miles from there to Los Angeles Valley College, and then the twenty-two miles home—through the worst of Los Angeles traffic. It was madness, but there was nothing I could do. It was well into August. School would start soon. I would have incoming students to welcome, new faculty to orient, budgets to plan. I bought him more khakis and button-down shirts, spent as much time with him as I could. A few weeks later, I headed back to Chicago. • The root of sin is lust and the desire to satisfy that lust. . . . Lust only creates wanting and wanting creates greed and greed burns Flesh. It is lust that causes us to believe we have to have something at all cost. This is my suffering, this is my hell. 24 hours all night. There is no day. My soul in its entirety is in darkness.

The jigsaw puzzle soon fell apart, and college was the first piece to go. The commute was just too much; I doubt Michael made it through even two weeks of classes. The job, meanwhile, lasted until November, when I got a nearly hysterical call. Michael said he couldn’t do it. He was drowning. He wasn’t going to make it. When I left L.A., I had promised him that if he ever needed me I would be there. After the call, I went straight to the airport, and arrived in L.A. just in time to take him to dinner. Michael was teary and despondent. After work, he said, some of his Latino co-workers had called him a nigger. He fought them in the parking lot, and walked away from the job. Never told his bosses or co-workers that he was quitting—just didn’t return. So now he was back to square one. Worse than that, really, since he’d proved himself unreliable to an employer. He was mostly spending his time at home, playing video games with his nephews. He no longer saw a future for himself. I mainly tried to listen; I didn’t have much to offer. I could promise to get him into an apartment, if he could get another job. But I was no longer in a position to stay and help him find one. I had too many obligations in Chicago. November was tenure-review time, with mounds of papers to read and unending cycles of meetings that the dean, in particular, was not supposed to miss. My professional reputation was at stake. Michael would have to make the next push for himself. When I visited L.A. just before the winter break, it seemed as if Michael had made that push. He had found an apartment, he told me, and was ready to put down a deposit. Could I come and see it? The place was on the fourth floor of a vintage Craftsman-style building overlooking the 101 freeway. It was big and spacious, with gleaming wood floors. As I wound through the rooms, Michael began telling me about how he and Bree wanted to move in. I had no idea he was still seeing Bree, let alone making plans to move in together. My face must have conveyed surprise, though I tried not to react too strongly. (Learning how to suppress visible emotion is an occupational demand of being a dean.) I told him that I wanted to know what the job situation was. Had he lined up a new gig? What did Bree do—did she have a job? Our voices echoed in the empty apartment. Michael leaned against a windowsill, the sky and the freeway shining behind him. There was something shamefaced in him as he answered. No, he didn’t have a job. Bree was into hair styling, but, no, she didn’t have one, either. What, exactly, were they thinking? Michael didn’t have much of an answer. Plainly, the plan involved taking advantage of me to some degree. In that moment, I encountered a different Michael from the one I knew. I saw something calculating, something I’d never seen before. I didn’t ask to talk to Bree, who I’d come to realize was the woman in the gold Mercedes crawling past our homecoming party. All I was able to say was that I couldn’t possibly pay the deposit—plus some number of months’ rent, plus co-sign a lease—when neither of them had a job. Michael’s face tensed. He said he understood. This was the day I understood that the idea that I could stand my baby cousin up on his own two feet was a fantasy; it had always had too much of me in it. From this point on, Michael ceased confiding in me. Our phone conversations never burrowed below the surface. I no longer knew how to help. Michael spent more and more time with Bree, whose possessiveness was violent. According to Karen, Bree cut Michael three times between December and May, and each time Michael tried to pass the injuries off as the result of someone attempting to rob him. He had also begun to suspect Bree of cheating. Late one night, he sneaked under her window, in the hope—he told me later—that catching her in the act would give him an easy out from the relationship. That night, he got into a fight with a lover of Bree’s, and the police were called. Michael went straight to prison for a parole violation, and remained there for around a year. It was a catastrophic defeat. Despite the fact that we wrote each other letters, I somehow obliterated from my memory all traces of Michael’s second stint in prison. When he got out again, just months before the 2008 stock-market crash, he returned to what we hoped would be the comfort of his mother’s house. Just a short time later, though, he began living with Bree. In the months before Michael’s parole violation, Karen and Bree had waged a battle rooted in a strong mutual dislike. Now Bree sought a formal treaty. She called Karen to say that Michael would be living with her, and that she didn’t want any conflict. This was hard for Karen. She knew that her son’s relationship was violent. As Karen understood it, Bree had been in prison for attempting to kill a boyfriend, and the only time she had seen Michael get physical with anyone was when he fought Bree on her pin-neat front lawn. Bree had been going down the street, breaking car windows and throwing things at Karen’s house. Michael had gone outside to warn her away. The two came to blows. Through a window, Karen saw Michael knock Bree out. That night, Karen added to her prayers the hope that the Lord would liberate Michael from his misery. By December, Michael’s world had fully contracted. While living at Bree’s house, he became known on the street as Big Mike. That winter, he revealed to his sister a gun, hidden in a towel, in Bree’s Mercedes. By the spring, he was running drugs, including at least one trip to Texas. Later, the detectives investigating his murder found PCP in his room. In June, 2009, I got married, in New Jersey, where I had recently accepted an appointment at a distinguished research institute. Michael came to the wedding—his first airplane flight since his release. He was handsome in a beige jacket and crimson shirt, with matching crimson alligator-skin shoes. But there was so much I couldn’t see: I couldn’t make out the demons chasing Michael as he greeted the other guests at the door to the chapel.

Five weeks after that champagne-filled wedding day, my father called me from Maryland with the news: Michael had been discovered in a car in South Los Angeles, dead from multiple gunshots. I was in England, and I remember my father’s voice, the careful, clipped speech of a retired professor, crackling as if through the first transatlantic cables. Heading to the airport, I knew that the police were looking for a woman, and that Bree had disappeared. Two weeks later, she was charged with his murder. “I hate my fans.” She had, evidently, shot Michael in her kitchen. There had been one witness, a middle-school-age boy. He hadn’t seen anything, but he had heard voices and gunshots. With the help of relatives, Bree cleaned Michael up nicely. She then bundled him in a blanket, put him in his little hatchback, and drove him to the street corner where he was found. Three accessories—all members of Bree’s family—were also charged. Eventually, Bree pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter, and was sentenced to twenty-two years in prison. Having by now undergone gender-reassignment surgery, she was sent to a women’s prison. Michael and Bree had first met and become lovers when they were both inmates at Norco, which she had entered at the age of twenty-five. Bree was a little more than two years older than Michael. She was just his height and just his weight, a transgender woman still early in the process of transitioning. As far as the public record reveals, she’d been convicted for assault with a firearm. I thought back to Michael’s homecoming in 2006, to Bree cruising by in her chariot, coming for to carry Michael home. We all had thought the relationship ended when Bree left prison a year ahead of Michael, and we believed that Michael’s home was with us. What Michael himself thought or wanted that homecoming day, I will never know. He hadn’t invited Bree to the picnic. Yet she came and would stay. When Michael contemplated renting that tidy little studio apartment on Ethel Avenue, with its white fence and pearly roses, it was voluptuous Bree in her tight clothes and gold Mercedes whom he was visualizing having to introduce to those kindly landladies. How would it have gone if he had taken this “associate” home with him? When he spent those twenty-four hours dithering over whether to rent the apartment, I see now that his real choice was whether to repudiate the first and only love of his life. He chose Bree, and it would prove to be his life’s defining decision. • There are those who await to fulfill their destiny. I see in them a sincere and apologetic heart for their ill misdeeds. They are the one who will change the world positively or positively change someone’s world. Hell cannot hold the latter of the two opposites but in time will only spit them back out into society to do what is right. The hell that I live in cannot hold Dante. Hell can test and try one’s self but it cannot hold Dante and it will not hold me. In the Inferno , the dead are trapped forever. Surely, the biggest and most important difference in the Inferno and my hell called prison, is that I have a way out."

I knew nothing about finance and wasn’t even really clear as to what bankers did; all I knew was that they wore snazzy suits and looked coolly impatient. My reason for wanting to be a banker was simple: I was a student at Harvard Law School, and I figured that, instead of working very hard as a corporate lawyer, I might as well work the same amount in finance and make even more money. Many of my fellow-students appeared to be thinking the same thing; as I remember, almost a third of the people I knew who were graduating in my year applied to become bankers.

To interview with the less prosperous investment banks, we waited in the then mangy hallways of the Sheraton Commander Hotel, in Cambridge. For the bulge-bracket firms, like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, we met in hospitality suites at the Charles and tried to hide our anxiety. When I am nervous, I become giddy and happily talkative. In the hospitality suites, I stationed myself by the sushi platters and offered advice on what was especially delicious. If there was an open bar at some expensive restaurant during a recruiting event, I’d gleefully debate with the bartender whether I should drink the Johnny Walker Blue or some rare Talisker.

The fact that I knew nothing was immediately clear. After a few interviews in which I saw my interlocutor flick his eyes over my résumé and register that I had no relevant experience, I decided to start lying.

I began telling interviewers that throughout high school and much of college I had worked night shifts at 7-Elevens and gas stations. I came up with this lie because I was Indian and was used to being seen through stereotypes—used to being asked if I spoke English or if I was studying to be a doctor. The reason I chose this particular lie was that people love the hardworking-immigrant-who-makes-good narrative. It allows them to feel that they live in a benign, meritocratic world, and to believe, in a back-channel way, that they are deserving of their success. Also, bankers work bone-crunching hours. In my night-shift history, my interviewers would see evidence that I was a tireless employee.

During the interviews, as I told my story, I would almost pop out of my chair with nervous exultation. I had a gift for inventing details. I’d discuss how scary it was to work nights at a 7-Eleven, how a group of young men would come in and begin stealing and I’d be afraid to confront them. Or I’d describe how many layers of clothing I had to wear as a gas-station attendant during the winter; how hookers would hang out at the gas station to solicit customers; how my clothes smelled of hot dogs by the end of a 7-Eleven shift; how, around four in the morning, the alcoholics showed up to buy beer because they had run out of liquor at home. I knew that what I was offering my interviewers was pain porn, but playing my audience—especially playing them with a stereotype that had caused me anger and hurt in the past—filled me with delight. I was so excited as I told my stories that I sometimes even half believed them.

Before the lies, the people who interviewed me had rarely revealed what they felt; now they laughed and sighed along with what seemed like recognition, almost as if they were seeing their own hardships in my tales. That was the sort of self-pitying, self-aggrandizing wretches we were.

I started getting callbacks. I was flown to New York for daylong interviews, in which eventually I would come up against someone who didn’t care about my time at 7-Eleven. All that this man—it was invariably a man—quite reasonably cared about was whether I could make his life easier by getting work done. He’d ask me what method of valuation could be best massaged to show an earnings-accretive merger in a financial model. He’d ask about the difference between financial and tax accounting. Usually, the sort of person who asked such questions was an associate or a junior vice-president, who worked closely with the nitty-gritty of financial modelling. Inevitably, that person would tell the powers that be, “Hey, this guy is an idiot!,” and I would be rejected.

Finally, one day, I was in New York for a series of interviews and the junior vice-president I was supposed to see was called into a meeting. I knew right then that I would be offered the job. When I got the call, I accepted on the spot. I was smart enough to understand that I had got lucky. “Do you know when I get the signing bonus?” I asked. ♦

http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/trucking-as-a-state-of-mind,newyorker,Trucking as a State of Mind,[],"Finn Murphy arrived for his first day of work at Callahan Bros. Moving & Storage on May 22, 1976. He had just turned eighteen. In the fall, he would be starting at Colby College; his parents were churchgoing golfers from Cos Cob, Connecticut, who imagined a professional career for their son. Murphy had different ideas. He liked the cardboard-box smell of the Callahan office and admired the movers, who wore T-shirts brined with sweat. Later that day, he helped carry a four-hundred-pound lateral file down a set of winding stairs. When it slipped, he writes, in “ The Long Haul: A Trucker’s Tales of Life on the Road ,” its “metal edge carved a crimson serpent down the inside of my forearm.” Inspecting the cut, Murphy thought, “First blood.” He was angry with his parents and with society in general; he wanted “tough work for tough men.” At Colby, he smoked a lot of pot and conducted an independent study about the economics of the long-haul-moving industry. After his junior year, he dropped out to become a mover full time. “From now on, I’ll be the captain of my ship and the master of my soul,” he recalls thinking. “To put it another way: Screw you, everybody.”

A mood of mystery surrounds movers and truckers. Like priests, movers shepherd us through life’s transitions; like cowboys, truckers drive the roads we’ll never know. Both see America in ways the rest of us don’t. In “The Long Haul,” Murphy, who specializes in long-distance moves and drives an eighteen-wheeler, promises to bring us into his semi-mythic world. And yet Murphy himself is the book’s real mystery. In the 1970 film “Five Easy Pieces,” Jack Nicholson played Bobby Dupea, a classical pianist who gives up music to work on an oil rig. By turns, Bobby was charming and contemptuous, contemplative and enraged, wise and impulsive, truculent and loose. Murphy, another prepster gone rogue, is all of these things, too, and one spends much of the book wondering what drives him. Like Anthony Bourdain’s “ Kitchen Confidential ” and Henry Marsh’s “ Do No Harm ,” “The Long Haul” is an occupational memoir with an untold human story at its center. In crushingly hard work, Murphy seems to be escaping from himself.

Much of “The Long Haul” focusses on the mechanics of long-haul moving. It’s cyclical work that begins and ends with a trailer resembling “an operating room scrubbed for the next surgery.” In between, there’s a lot of packing, lifting, loading, and hauling. The furniture is always heavy; the driving is often terrifying; the combination darkly absurd. Early in the book, on a journey from Fairfield, Connecticut, to Aspen, Colorado, Murphy, in the Rockies, descends the twelve-thousand-foot Loveland Pass. The hairpins are covered in ice and slush. His fifty-three-foot trailer weighs twenty thousand pounds and contains furniture belonging to “a former investment banker from a former investment bank who apparently escaped the toppled citadel with his personal loot intact”—including eight six-hundred-pound Qing-dynasty tombstones. “I downshift my thirteen-speed transmission to fifth gear, slow to 23 mph, and set my Jake brake to all eight cylinders,” Murphy writes. As the brakes struggle to resist the truck’s momentum, the whole cab shudders and Murphy’s arms shake. A jackknife seems imminent. At such moments Murphy’s life resembles “Mad Max” and “Antiques Roadshow” combined.

Murphy likes “low company and hard work,” but also has a crush on Terry Gross and reads “Mansfield Park” in the sleeper of his cab. Is trucking really the right life for him? Midway through “The Long Haul,” he gets fed up with life on the road and quits. Two decades later—after he’s “washed ashore in a city out West” with “no job, no plans, no nothing”—he returns to it, determined “to approach the work with serious intellectual intention toward performing even the smallest tasks properly.” Earlier this year, in a book called “ Masters of Craft: Old Jobs in the New Urban Economy ,” the sociologist Richard Ocejo investigated why certain blue-collar jobs—butcher, barber, bartender, distiller—have become suddenly prestigious while others have not. “Why are there no ‘cool’ plumbers, electricians, or maintenance workers?” Ocejo asks. He finds that only certain kinds of work are seen as having the “philosophical underpinnings” that—once they are enacted theatrically—give manual laborers the intellectual aura of knowledge workers. At times, Murphy seems determined to unearth a philosophy of long-haul moving. His goal is to practice moving and trucking in an elevated way.

To articulate this philosophy, Murphy devotes much of “The Long Haul” to the nuances of moving. He compares loading boxes into the truck to an athletic version of Tetris. (A well-loaded trailer contains many “tiers” of furniture, with heavy items on the bottom and smaller, odd-shaped items, called “chowder,” on top; a good mover can walk around a house and build tiers in his head.) As a “boutique” mover specializing in high-end relocations, Murphy—like Don Ainsworth, the dangerous-goods trucker in John McPhee’s “ A Fleet of One ”—owns and operates his own truck. He hires his own moving teams, and, in partnership with a dispatcher, sets his own schedule—a never-ending sprint of packing, driving, and unpacking. He stays awake with the help of “Dr Cola”—a combination of Coke and Dr Pepper—and saves time and money by sleeping in his cab. Regular truckers, called “freighthaulers,” are “gearheads” who boast about their powerful trucks and look down on movers as “bedbuggers.” They are also employees of big shipping companies who often live hand to mouth. Murphy may be knee-deep in the “muddy, filth-strewn, windblown end of the American cesspit”—packing boxes in the attic of an elderly hoarder, say, with a crew of probable felons he recruited at a local bar—but he makes around two hundred thousand dollars a year. (He looks down, too, on the clichéd freighthauler aesthetic: country music, big belt buckles, tattoos.)

Out on “the big slab”—the highway—truckers are responsible for checking the connectors and couplings that link their cabs to their trailers, and for monitoring tire pressure (a big job when there are eighteen tires). In a similar way, they must maintain psychological equilibrium. Drivers find solace in loose, anonymous fellowship. In a coin-operated truckstop shower in Kittery, Maine, another trucker approaches Murphy (“Now don’t get all edgy there, driver”), introduces himself as “Lone Ranger” (his C.B. handle; Murphy’s is “U-Turn”), and shares his life story. On the road, drivers use the radio to warn each other about hazards—natural and man-made (“Kojak with a Kodak 201 sunset” means “a state trooper has a radar gun at mile-marker 201 on the westbound side”). One night in South Carolina, Murphy finds himself “running convoy” with nine other trucks. For a hundred and thirty miles, the convoy, carrying fresh flowers, steel, and hot tubs, drives sixty-five, undisturbed by “four-wheelers” (that is, by regular cars). “There was a plane of consciousness that we had together,” Murphy writes. “It’s the closest thing to a Zen experience I know except when I’m in my loading trance.”

Murphy understands himself as a chronicler of American decline. He reports that quality American furniture has disappeared—it’s been replaced by IKEA —and that no one owns books anymore. Hauling cross-country means “breezing through one dead or dying town after another” in a landscape that “looks like an episode from ‘The Walking Dead’ ”; everywhere, rings of chain stores and pawnshops surround decaying post-industrial downtowns. Murphy concludes that, outside of the big cities, university towns are the only good places left. Ruminating on American tourism posters—apple orchards in New England, porch swings down South, cowboys out West—he writes, “If a tourist poster of America were made with some verisimilitude, it would show a Subway franchise inside a convenience-store gas station with an under-paid immigrant mopping the floor and a street person at the traffic light holding a cardboard sign that reads ANYTHING HELPS .”"

“Dunkirk”

The new Christopher Nolan movie is set in 1940, during the mass evacuation of British and French troops from northern France to the relative safety of England. The saga, an essential chapter in the British wartime narrative, is not widely known elsewhere, and what Nolan delivers is neither a history lesson nor even much of a war film. A good deal of it strikes the senses, not to mention the nerves, as an exercise in high tension and near-abstraction, as men (there are almost no women to be seen) are perilously poised between land and water, water and air, darkness and light. Mark Rylance, dourly determined, plays the skipper of the Moonstone, one of the innumerable “Little Ships” that went to the aid of those who were trapped on the beaches. Overhead, Tom Hardy is in typically phlegmatic form as a Spitfire pilot who must protect the naval vessels from German bombers. The movie feels old-fashioned whenever it seeks to stir up British pride; as a fable of survival, though, with its quicksilver editing and an anxious score by Hans Zimmer, it amazes and exhausts in equal measure. With Kenneth Branagh, Fionn Whitehead, and Harry Styles.— Anthony Lane

“Girls Trip”

This warmhearted, occasionally uproarious comedy doesn’t quite sustain the heights of its performers’ inspirations. Ryan (Regina Hall), a best-selling author, is chosen to deliver the keynote address at the Essence Festival, in New Orleans, and she invites her three longtime best friends to join her for a sentimental and hard-partying reunion. Sasha (Queen Latifah), a journalist who’s now on the celebrity beat, has money trouble; Lisa (Jada Pinkett Smith), a nurse and divorced mother of two young children, is lonely; and Dina (Tiffany Haddish), an outrageously brazen pleasure-seeker, seems oblivious of the consequences of her actions. Meanwhile, Ryan learns that Stewart (Mike Colter), her husband and business partner, is having an affair with a younger woman (Deborah Ayorinde). These women’s problems have substance even though their characters are thinly written, and the film’s comedic flourishes offer a refreshing frankness about sex from women’s perspectives. The view of middle-class African-American women’s lives behind closed doors, despite its antic exaggeration, has a lived-in specificity. Malcolm D. Lee’s direction doesn’t offer much style or vigor, but Haddish delivers a wild yet precise performance of verbal and gestural fury that puts her at the forefront of contemporary comedy.— Richard Brody

“Lady Macbeth”

A striking début feature from William Oldroyd, based—with many alterations—on a novella by Nikolai Leskov, which also spawned an opera by Shostakovich. The setting has moved from Russia to the north of England, in 1865, and to the unlovely castle-like home of Alexander (Paul Hilton) and his new wife, Katherine (Florence Pugh). He is a boor, often absent; she is weary and resentful, desperate to crack the tedium of her days and nights. Opportunity presents itself in the person of Sebastian (Cosmo Jarvis), a groom from the stables, who ends up sharing not merely her bed but, to his great discomfort, her dinner table. The wrongs of the situation—pitiless crimes as well as social outrages—acquire their own momentum, and, if our initial sympathies lie with the oppressed heroine, we soon grow alarmed, and then appalled, by the lengths to which she will go in her reckonings. Oldroyd’s film is constructed and framed with unstinting care; sometimes, indeed, you want it to cut loose, although Pugh lends a definite dash of madness to her impassioned role. With Naomi Ackie, as the lady’s maid, and Christopher Fairbank, as the husband’s horrible father, who deserves everything he gets.— Anthony Lane

“Person to Person” ( In limited release .)

Dustin Guy Defa assembles a vigorous and whimsical cast for the many comedic and dramatic strands of this sweet-and-sour New York street poem, inspired by his 2014 short film of the same title. The new film, like the short, begins with the adventures of a record dealer named Bene (Bene Coopersmith); he’s on the trail of a rare Charlie Parker LP that comes with an odd backstory. Ray (George Sample III) has caused real trouble and knows it; he’s in hiding after posting nude photos of his ex-girlfriend online. A high-school student (Tavi Gevinson) with more attitude than experience seeks adventure and romance; two reporters, a veteran (Michael Cera) and a rookie (Abbi Jacobson), forge a bond on a stakeout while investigating a crime in which a clock-shop owner (Philip Baker Hall) is involved. The crisscrossing action looks lovingly at the self-made dramas of city life, despite its intimate cruelty and looming violence, and the lyrical riffs of dialogue come bubbling off the screen, but the drama feels frictionless—an ideal of urban grit that, for all its geographical specificity, never touches the ground. With Isiah Whitlock, Jr., Marvin Gurewitz, and Dakota O’Hara, with her signature behind- the-beat diction.— Richard Brody

“War for the Planet of the Apes”

If only Darwin were alive to see this film. Caesar, incarnated by Andy Serkis, is living proof that the highest human virtues—valor, compassion, a keen intelligence, and a gift for leadership—are most credibly combined in a monkey. In this latest chapter of the simian saga, Caesar plans to lead his freedom-loving comrades to a promised land; first, however, there is a military lunatic (Woody Harrelson) to contend with, and murders to be avenged. What follows is often cruel, and hard to classify as entertainment; we see a labor camp in full spate, and—surely a cinematic first—some form of ape crucifixion. Matt Reeves’s film takes itself extremely seriously, and, without a glimmer of irony, adds a touch of religious allegory to both the dialogue and the highfalutin images with which the story concludes. Still, the technical achievement marches on, and there appears to be no challenge that cannot be met and overcome by the magi of the digital craft. (Do orangutans really cry?) The most affable character, new to the franchise, is a chimp who, after a long spell in a zoo, speaks English—voiced by Steve Zahn—rather better than he gibbers or howls.— Anthony Lane"

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/10/shakespeares-cure-for-xenophobia,newyorker,Shakespeare’s Cure for Xenophobia,[],"I attended university in a very different world from the one in which I now teach and live. For a start, Yale College, which I entered in 1961, was all male. Women were not matriculated until five years after I had received my B.A. degree. Among the undergraduates, there were only a handful of students from Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, and very few African-Americans, Asian-Americans, or Hispanics, unless one counted a couple of prep-school-educated heirs to grand South American fortunes. The Yale that I attended was overwhelmingly North American and white, as well as largely Protestant. It was difficult for the admissions office to identify Catholics, but applicants with conspicuously Irish, Italian, or Polish names were at a disadvantage. For Jews, there was a numerus clausus , not even disguised by the convenient excuse of “geographical distribution.” And the whole system was upheld by a significant number of legacies, along with a pervasive air of privilege and clubbiness. To display too much interest in one’s studies or a concern for grades was distinctly uncool. This was still the era of what was called the “gentleman’s C.” I picked all this up within days of arriving in New Haven, but Yale was for me an unfamiliar country whose customs I knew that I could never master. Neither of my parents had gone to college. My mother, along with the other girls in her family, was expected to begin work as a secretary directly after high school. Though my father practiced law, he had attended law school just after serving in the First World War, when a liberal-arts degree was not yet a prerequisite. A good thing, too, since my grandfather, a ragpicker, would have had difficulty mustering the will or the means to pay even the modest tuition fees then required. My grandparents were not indifferent to learning, but they were poor, and for them any learning that was not vocational was necessarily religious. The highest status in their cultural world came not from wealth or power but from the possession of Talmudic knowledge. Theirs was an insular community in which sexual selection—for Darwin, a central motor of mammalian evolution—had for centuries favored slender, nearsighted, stoop-shouldered young men rocking back and forth as they pondered the complex, heavily annotated, often esoteric tractates of Jewish law. None of this was part of my upbringing: most of it had been abandoned when my grandparents fled tsarist Lithuania, in the late eighteen-eighties, and settled in Boston. But the heavy Talmudic volumes left a residue, an inherited respect for textual interpretation that—reshaped into secularized form—led people like me to embrace the humanities, an arena in which the English Department held pride of place. When I began to take classes at Yale, I could not understand, let alone emulate, the amused indifference of many of my classmates. I felt within me what in 1904 Henry James, observing immigrants in New York, reproved as “the waiting spring of intelligence,” signalling the “immensity of the alien presence climbing higher and higher.” I did not feel alien—I was born in this country, as my parents had been, and I donned my Yale sweatshirt without a sense of imposture—but I seized upon the opportunity I’d been granted to learn with an energy that seemed slightly foreign. I had a particularly intense engagement with my freshman English-literature course. Midway through the year, the professor asked me if I would be interested in being his research assistant, helping him prepare the index for a book he had just completed. Ecstatic, I immediately agreed. In those days, research assistants were required to apply for their jobs through the financial-aid office, where I dutifully made an appointment. I was in for a surprise. “Greenblatt is a Jewish name, isn’t it?” the financial-aid officer said. I agreed that it was. “Frankly,” he went on, “we are sick and tired of the number of Jews who come into this office after they’re admitted and try to wheedle money out of Yale University.” I stammered, “How can you make such a generalization?” “Well, Mr. Greenblatt,” he replied, “what do you think of Sicilians?” I answered that I didn’t think I knew any Sicilians. “J. Edgar Hoover,” he continued, citing the director of the F.B.I., “has statistics that prove that Sicilians have criminal tendencies.” So, too, he explained, Yale had statistics that proved that a disproportionate number of Jewish students were trying to get money from the university by becoming research assistants. Then he added, “We could people this whole school with graduates of the Bronx High School of Science, but we choose not to do so.” Pointing out lamely that I had gone to high school in Newton, Massachusetts, I slunk away without a job. The conversation left me shaken. Decades later, I recall it with a blend of outrage and wonder inflected by my recognition of the fact that African-American students have had it much worse, and that other ethnic groups and religions have now replaced Jews as the focus of the anxiety that afflicted my interlocutor. What was particularly upsetting to me at the time was that the experience appeared to confirm my parents’ worst fears—fears that had struck me, when I was growing up, as absurdly outdated and provincial. For my parents, the world was rigidly divided between “us” and “them,” and they lived their lives, it seemed to me, as if they were forever hemmed into an ethnic ghetto. Shortly after my encounter with the financial-aid officer, T. S. Eliot, the greatest living poet in the English language and a winner of the Nobel Prize, came to Yale. Catching the excitement of the impending visit, I began to read him with an avidity that has continued into the present. But that meant that I quickly encountered the strain of anti-Semitism in Eliot’s early poetry and prose, a strain no less ugly for being typical of his conservative milieu. “The population should be homogeneous,” Eliot told an audience at the University of Virginia in 1933, the year that Hitler came to power and the prospect arose of a mass outpouring of refugees seeking protection from the growing menace. “Where two or more cultures exist in the same place they are likely either to be fiercely self-conscious or both to become adulterate.” Perhaps it occurred to him that it was already far too late to prevent two or more cultures from existing in the United States. “What is still more important is unity of religious background,” he added, and then made his point more explicitly: “Reasons of race and religion combine to make any large number of free-thinking Jews undesirable.’’ Eliot’s powerful early poetry had already made this undesirability clear. In “Burbank with a Baedeker: Bleistein with a Cigar,” he conjured up the primal ooze from which he saw those creatures emerging: A lustreless protrusive eye

In the course of that freshman year, I read Shakespeare’s “ The Merchant of Venice ,” with its echoing question, “What news on the Rialto?” Encountering the play at the moment I did, together with T. S. Eliot, seemed only to reinforce my parents’ grimmest account of the way things were.

There is something very strange about experiencing “The Merchant of Venice” when you are somehow imaginatively implicated in the character and actions of its villain. You laugh when Shylock’s servant, the clown Gobbo, contemplates running away from his penny-pinching master. You smile when Shylock’s daughter, Jessica, having escaped from her father’s dark house into the arms of her beloved, declares, “I shall be saved by my husband. He hath made me a Christian.” You shudder when the implacable Shylock sharpens his knife on the sole of his boot. You applaud the resolution of the dilemma, when clever Portia comes up with the legal technicality that confounds Shylock’s murderous plan. The Jew who had insisted upon the letter of the law is undone by the letter of the law; it is what is called poetic justice. But, all the same, you feel uneasy. What, exactly, are you applauding and smiling at? How are you supposed to view the Jewish daughter who robs her father and bestows the money on her fortune-hunting Christian suitor? Do you join in the raucous laughter of the Christians who mock and spit on the Jew? Or do you secretly condone Shylock’s vindictive, malignant rage? Where are you, at the end of the harrowing scene in the courtroom, when Portia asks the man she has outmaneuvered and ruined whether he agrees to the terms she has dictated, terms that include the provision that he immediately become a Christian? “Art thou contented, Jew?” she prods. “What dost thou say?” And what do you think the Jew actually feels when he answers, “I am content”? Back in my undergraduate days, when I began to ask these questions, I came to a decision. I wasn’t going to allow myself to be crushed by the bigoted financial-aid officer, but I wasn’t going to adopt my parents’ defensive posture, either. I wouldn’t attempt to hide my otherness and pass for what I was not. I wouldn’t turn away from works that caused me pain as well as pleasure. Instead, insofar as I could, I would pore over the whole vast, messy enterprise of culture as if it were my birthright. I was determined to understand this birthright, including what was toxic in it, as completely as possible. I’m now an English professor at Harvard, and in recent years some of my students have seemed acutely anxious when they are asked to confront the crueller strains of our cultural legacy. In my own life, that reflex would have meant closing many of the books I found most fascinating, or succumbing to the general melancholy of my parents. They could not look out at a broad meadow from the windows of our car without sighing and talking about the number of European Jews who could have been saved from annihilation and settled in that very space. (For my parents, meadows should have come with what we now call “trigger warnings.”) I was eager to expand my horizons, not to retreat into a defensive crouch. Prowling the stacks of Yale’s vast library, I sometimes felt giddy with excitement. I had a right to all of it, or, at least, to as much of it as I could seize and chew upon. And the same was true of everyone else. I already had an inkling of what I now more fully grasp. My experience of mingled perplexity, pleasure, and discomfort was only a version—informed by the accidents of a particular religion, family, identity, and era—of an experience shared by every thinking person in the course of a lifetime. What you inherit, what you receive from a world that you did not fashion but that will do its best to fashion you, is at once beautiful and repellent. You somehow have to come to terms with what is ugly as well as what is precious. “Use your indoor gun.” The task derives from the kind of creatures that we are. We arrive in the world only partially formed; a culture that has been in the making for hundreds of thousands of years will form the rest. And that culture will inevitably contain much that is noxious as well as beneficent. No one is exempt—not the Jew or the Muslim, of course, but also not the Cockney or the earl or the person whose ancestors came to America on the Mayflower or, for that matter, the person whose ancestors were Algonquins or Laplanders. Our species’ cultural birthright is a mixed blessing. It is what makes us fully human, but being fully human is a difficult work in progress. Though xenophobia is part of our complex inheritance—quickened, no doubt, by the same instinct that causes chimpanzees to try to destroy members of groups not their own—this inheritance is not our ineluctable fate. Even in the brief span of our recorded history, some five thousand years, we can watch societies and individuals ceaselessly playing with, reshuffling, and on occasion tossing out the cards that both nature and culture have dealt, and introducing new ones.

In seventeenth-century Venice, a Greek poem was published that celebrated the elopement of a Jewish heiress with a handsome Greek Orthodox baker who comes to her house to sell bread. The poem ends, after the girl’s conversion and wedding, with a raucous anti-Semitic chorus that mocks her distraught mother. The seventeenth-century poet Eremya Chelebi Kömürjian, an erudite Christian who spent his career in the Ottoman Empire, took up the same plot, which he recast in Armeno-Turkish (that is, Turkish written in Armenian characters) and set in Istanbul. In his version, “The Jewish Bride,” the Jewish girl, Mrkada, having fallen in love with Dimo, wishes to escape from the confines of her Jewish world: “The bed smells like poison, my homeland is as a prison.” The resourceful Dimo arranges for a boat to transport them, and the girl, slipping away under the cover of darkness, disguises herself as a man, with her curly golden hair hidden beneath a sable cap. Eluding the Jewish search parties, the lovers manage to reach the Christian principality of Walachia, where, in a solemn procession, Mrkada enters the cathedral and formally converts: They gave her the name Sophia the Pure.

She renounced the Jewish abracadabra. In this version, as in the Greek source, the wailing Jewish mother is mocked by a chorus of Christian girls who invite her to imagine her little grandson: Your daughter has already become pregnant.

She is already nourishing a grandson for you.

. . . The little half-bred Albanian,

His face is rather on the Jewish side.

Yet his eyes are ocean-blue.

Croak, you jealous witch! But then something strange happens. The focus shifts to the mother’s grief, which is given remarkably intense expression: They have torn away from my bosom my only one,

My only daughter, my blossomlike delicate one, my soul.

I have become a childless mother, I, this poor woman.

. . . My life is destroyed, not only my home.

The skies oppress me, heaven, the world are a jail, and likewise my day.

To others my tears are an amusing sight. And it is with this threnody of despair and the mother’s death—conveying, with full force, the profound misery of the person and the community sustaining the loss—that the poem ends. It is difficult to know how Eremya’s transformation of the story came about. Some scholars have suggested that he released, in the concluding section of his poem, the grief that he and his fellow-Christians knew they would feel if one of their own converted to Islam. What I suspect is that Eremya was a gifted poet who spent his life in an ethnically complex world and that he did what gifted poets do.

Last year was the five-hundredth anniversary of the creation of the Venetian ghetto. The Venetians had some uncertainty and disagreement about how to mark this anniversary, and one could see why. Starting in 1516, Jews, who had previously lived in the city wherever they chose, were required by law to reside and to worship in a small, poor area, the site of a former copper foundry. (The Venetian word for such a foundry was geto .) There they were permitted to run pawnshops that lent money at interest. They could emerge during the day to engage in a limited number of occupations— including buying and selling old clothes, laboring on Hebrew books in print workshops, teaching music and dance, and practicing medicine. But at night they were obliged to scuttle back to the ghetto, where they were shut in behind locked gates, guarded by men whose salaries the Jews themselves were required to pay. Jewish physicians were permitted to go out during the night to attend to their Christian patients; no one else could leave until morning. This is hardly an arrangement to celebrate in the twenty-first century, but it was an early attempt in modern history at a form of modus vivendi that would permit Venetians to live in proximity to an intensely disliked but useful neighbor. The usefulness was not universally acknowledged. At the time, in Italy and elsewhere, itinerant preachers were stirring up mobs to demand the expulsion of the Jews, as had been done recently in Spain and Portugal and, centuries earlier, in England. A scant generation later, Martin Luther, in Germany, urged the Protestant faithful to raze the Jews’ synagogues, schools, and houses, to forbid their rabbis on pain of death to teach, and to burn all Jewish prayer books and Talmudic writings. At the time that the ghetto was created, there were people still living who could remember when three Venetian Jews, accused of the ritual killing of Christians for their blood, were convicted of this entirely fantastical crime and burned to death. In Venice, locking the Jews up at night may have given them a small measure of protection from the paranoid fears of those with whom they dealt during the day. The ghetto was a compromise formation, neither absorption nor expulsion. It was a topographical expression of extreme ambivalence. Shakespeare could in principle have heard about it, when he sat down to write his comedy; the ghetto had been in existence for some eighty years and there had been many English travellers to Venice. Indeed, there is evidence that the playwright took pains to gather information. For example, he did not have his Jewish characters swear by Muhammad, as fifteenth-century English playwrights did. He clearly grasped not only that Jewish dietary laws prohibited the eating of pork but also that observant Jews often professed to find the very smell of pork disagreeable. He marvellously imagined the way that a Jewish moneylender might use the Bible to construct a witty Midrashic justification of his own profit margin. He had learned that the Rialto was the site for news and for trade, and that Shylock would conduct business there. But Shakespeare seems not to have understood, or perhaps simply not to have been interested in, the fact that Venice had a ghetto. In whatever he read or heard about the city, he appears to have been struck far less by the separation of Jews and Christians than by the extent of their mutual intercourse. Though Shylock says that he will not pray with the Christians or eat their nonkosher food, he enumerates the many ways in which he routinely interacts with them. “I will buy with you, talk with you, walk with you, and so following,” he declares. To audiences in England—a country that had expelled its entire Jewish population in the year 1290 and had allowed no Jews to return—those everyday interactions were the true novelty. In “The History of Italy” (1549), the first English book on the subject, William Thomas went out of his way to remark on what he called a “liberty of strangers” particular to Venice: No man there marketh another’s doings, or . . . meddleth with another man’s living. If thou be a papist, there shalt thou want no kind of superstition to feed upon. If thou be a gospeler, no man shall ask why thou comest not to [the Catholic] church. If thou be a Jew, a Turk, or believest in the devil (so thou spread not thine opinions abroad), thou art free from all controlment. . . . And generally of all other things, so thou offend no man privately, no man shall offend thee, which undoubtedly is one principal cause that draweth so many strangers thither. By contrast, a Venetian observer in Renaissance London was struck by the xenophobia of the English. “Foreigners in London are little liked, not to say hated, so those who are wise take care to dress in the English style,” Orazio Busino wrote in his diary, “and make themselves understood by signs whenever they can avoid speaking, and so they avoid mishaps.” For an Elizabethan, Venice signified an astonishing, even bizarre cosmopolitanism. Hence Shakespeare could not imagine Shylock’s house set apart in a locked ghetto; he emphasized, instead, that it was on a “public street.” If the Jew’s daughter should fail to lock the doors and close the casements, she would be able to watch the Christians parade by in carnival masks and listen to “the drum / And the vile squealing of the wry-necked fife.” And, when the play depicts Shylock reluctantly going out at night to dine with the Christians, it probably did not occur to the playwright that in real life the Jewish usurer would need a special permit to do so. Such permits were not part of the English imagination of Venice; they were part of the Venetians’ attempt to negotiate with their xenophobic inheritance. Although he may not have learned about the ghetto, Shakespeare, too, participated in the attempt to negotiate with a xenophobic inheritance. At the level of plot, he pursued the idea of equality before the law. Venice, as a commercial entrepôt with wide-ranging trading partners, depended upon “the liberty of strangers.” In order to protect property rights and preserve confidence, its legal system had to treat contracts as equally binding upon Christians and others, citizens and aliens. The Jew, as we see in the dispute over the lapsed bond, has to be formally regarded as someone who possesses full legal standing in the eyes of the court. When Portia, disguised as the learned judge, enters the courtroom to adjudicate the case between Antonio and Shylock, she begins by asking, “Which is the merchant here? And which the Jew?” Though the line often elicits laughter, from a legal perspective it insists upon the court’s impartiality. Shylock drives the point home. “You have among you many a purchased slave,” he argues in the trial scene, which you treat like animals simply because you bought them. This sounds like the beginning of an abolitionist manifesto, and for a brief moment it seems to teeter at the edge of one: Shall I say to you

“Let them be free, marry them to your heirs.

Why sweat they under burdens? Let their beds

Be made as soft as yours.” Why, yes, modern audiences might want to shout—let it be so. But the point here is not liberation from bondage: You will answer

“The slaves are ours.” So do I answer you.

The pound of flesh which I demand of him

Is dearly bought. ’Tis mine, and I will have it. The legal principle upon which Shylock insists has nothing to do with tolerance or human rights. It is strictly a defense of property ownership. The narrowness is important. Outside this carefully demarcated sphere, there is no underlying trust, no assumption of shared values, and no presumed equality. As soon as the formal legal issue shifts unexpectedly from a civil to a criminal matter—that is, to a Jew’s attempt to take the life of a Venetian Christian—Shylock is no longer regarded in the eyes of the court as Antonio’s equivalent. Instead, he is, as the play’s dominant society has always viewed him, irreducibly alien. “Kinky.” “The Merchant of Venice” seems to offer a pessimistic vision, then, of the prospect of mutual tolerance. On the city streets and in the rule-bound arena of the criminal court, the two faiths are mortal enemies. Shylock tries to destroy his Christian enemy legally by enforcing the letter of the bond; Portia succeeds in destroying her Jewish enemy by outwitting him at his own hairsplitting game. True, she doesn’t stick a knife into him, and that is important, both for the imagined world of the play and for the preservation of its theatrical genre. The comedy’s hope is that money, sexual desire, and intense legal pressure, rather than outright violence, will eventually suffice to absorb the strangers, or at least significant numbers of them, into the surrounding Christian community. Only conversion—in the case of Shylock’s daughter, her marriage to a fortune-hunting Christian; in the case of Shylock himself, conversion under the threat of execution—can dissipate hatred and save the play from bloodshed. “The Merchant of Venice” resists attempts to bring it into the Enlightenment, let alone to make it recognize the full tragic weight of centuries of racial and religious hatred. In its formal design, it steadfastly remains a comedy. Yet that formal resolution has not defined the play’s actual impact—not now, not when I first read it as a college freshman, and probably not even in Shakespeare’s time. As I grasp more fully after a lifetime of immersion in Shakespeare, the uncomfortable experience I had when I was seventeen—the troubled identification with the play’s villain, even in the midst of my pleasurable absorption in its comic plot—did not finally depend on my particular identity or history. The cunning magic of the play was the disturbance it arouses in everyone. If Shylock had behaved himself and remained a mere comic foil—like Don John the Bastard, in “ Much Ado About Nothing ”—there would have been no disturbance. But Shakespeare conferred too much energy on his Jewish usurer for the boundaries of native and alien, us and them, to remain intact. Shakespeare managed to register Shylock’s mordant sense of humor, the pain that shadowed his malevolence, his pride in his intelligence, his little household economies, his loneliness. We come to know these qualities for ourselves, not as mere concepts but as elements of our own experience. There’s good reason that most people think the Venetian merchant in the play’s title is the Jew.

At once aggressive and defensive, punitive and protective, the Venetian ghetto proved to be a remarkably durable arrangement—it was abolished, under Napoleon, only with the fall of the Serenissima in 1797. What’s more, it served as a powerful model throughout Italy, the rest of Europe, and the world, both in bricks and mortar and, when these were formally pulled down, in the minds and hearts of those on either side of the towering imaginary walls. My parents lived much of their lives behind such walls; I have to concede that they were never happier than when they were safely ensconced there. But the same Shakespeare who did not grasp that a ghetto existed in Venice had no patience with walls, real or imaginary, and, even in a play consumed with religious and ethnic animosity, he tore them down. He did so not by creating a lovable alien—his Jew is a villain who connives at legal murder—but by giving Shylock more theatrical vitality, quite simply more urgent, compelling life, than anyone else in his world has. The lines reverberate across the centuries: “You call me misbeliever, cutthroat dog, / And spit upon my Jewish gabardine, / And all for use of that which is mine own”; “This patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder, / Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day / More than the wildcat”; “Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions?”; “If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh?”; “I would my daughter were dead at my foot and the jewels in her ear!”; “Why there, there, there, there! A diamond gone cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse never fell upon our nation till now; I never felt it till now”; “Some men there are love not a gaping pig, / Some that are mad if they behold a cat, / And others when the bagpipe sings i’th’nose / Cannot contain their urine.” The life that sweeps across the stage here includes, as well, sudden glimpses into parts of an existence that the plot by itself did not demand. When Shylock learns that his daughter exchanged a turquoise ring for a monkey—a turquoise ring that she stole from him, and that had been a gift from his dead wife, Leah, his anguish is unmistakable. “Thou torturest me,” he tells the friend who brought him the news. “It was my turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor. I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.” Are such glimpses enough to do away with hatred of the other? Not at all. But they begin an unsettling from within. Even now, more than four centuries later, the unsettling that the play provokes remains a beautiful and disturbing experience. Shakespeare himself may have found it disturbing. He set out, it seems, to write a straightforward comedy, borrowed from Giovanni Fiorentino’s novella “Il Pecorone” (“The Big Sheep”), only to find himself increasingly drawn into the soul of the despised other. Shylock came perilously close to wrecking the comic structure of the play, a structure that Shakespeare only barely rescued by making the moneylender disappear for good at the end of the fourth act. It wasn’t the only time in his work that this excess of life had occurred. The playwright is said to have remarked that in “ Romeo and Juliet ” he had to kill Mercutio before Mercutio killed the play, and he ran a similar risk with characters like Jack Cade, Aaron the Moor, Malvolio, and Caliban. Indeed, the ability to enter deeply—too deeply, for the purposes of the plot—into almost every character he deployed was a signature. It accounts for the startling vividness of Adriana, the neglected wife in “The Comedy of Errors”; Bottom the Weaver, in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”; Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, in “Hamlet”; Cornwall’s brave servant, in “King Lear”; and many others. It helps explain the strange illusion that certain of his characters have lives independent of the play in which they appear. And it contributes to the moral and aesthetic complexity that characterizes so many of his plays. Consider, for example, the fact that for centuries critics have debated whether Brutus is the hero or the villain of “Julius Caesar.” In Oskar Eustis’s controversial production of the play last month, in Central Park, audiences chortled at a Trump-like despot—but were then brought up short by the horror of what befalls him, the carnage born of self-steeling righteousness. What leads to disaster is Brutus’s ideological decision to think of Caesar not as a human being at all but, rather, as “a serpent’s egg,” and therefore to “kill him in the shell.” Even after a lifetime of studying Shakespeare, I cannot always tell you precisely how he achieved this extraordinary life-making. I sometimes picture him attaching his characters like leeches to his arms and allowing them to suck his lifeblood. In the case of Shylock, it is wildly unlikely that Shakespeare had ever encountered a Jewish usurer, but he may have been drawing on his father’s moneylending and, for that matter, on his own. It is also possible that in his family there had been a recent, painful, unresolved experience of conversion, from Catholicism to Protestantism, an experience that would have deepened his engagement with his character’s plight: “Art thou contented, Jew? What dost thou say?” “I am content.”"
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/discovering-the-brilliance-of-helio-oiticica,newyorker,Discovering the Brilliance of Hélio Oiticica,[],"I’m getting braver at saying the name of a sorely under-known Brazilian artist whose retrospective at the Whitney Museum, “Hélio Oiticica: To Organize Delirium,” comes as an overdue revelation. Oiticica died in 1980, of a stroke, at the age of forty-two, after early success in Rio de Janeiro, a brush with fame in London, obscurity during seven years in New York, and a return to Rio that, at one opening, occasioned a riot. Along the way, he turned from superb abstract painting to innovative work in sculpture, film, writing, political action, and participatory installation, much of which remains as fresh as this morning. The sand, huts, potted plants, caged parrots, and inscribed poetry of his sprawling “Tropicália” (1968) await your barefoot delectation, should you choose to park your shoes in the rack provided. So do the multifarious love nests (mattresses, straw, chopped-up foam rubber, water) of a more austere faux beach, “Eden” (1969). Works that he made in New York and, at the time, showed only privately exalt sex, drugs, and rock and roll—delirium aplenty, yet managed with acute aesthetic intelligence. But back to the name. My pronunciation can still come out a little different every time, along a scale from the “Oy-ti- seek -a” recommended in the Times to the “Whoa-ta- cee -kah” that a self-confident Midwestern friend of mine swears by. I mention this because a tin ear for Portuguese makes me typical in an art world that, with exceptions, has long been inattentive to Latin America.

Oiticica was born in Rio in 1937 to an upper-middle-class and deeply cultured family. His father was a polymath engineer, mathematician, scientist, and experimental photographer whose own father, a philologist, published an anarchist newspaper. Oiticica spent two years in Washington, D.C., starting in 1947, while his father worked at the National Museum of Natural History. He devoured modern philosophy, favoring Nietzsche. Back in Rio, he wrote plays, studied painting, and, in 1955, joined a group of artists who were strongly influenced by European geometric abstraction. (This put them on a course alien to artists in the United States, where Abstract Expressionism—soon to be followed by Pop art and minimalism—sought to eclipse European modernism. The split proved enduring.) In hundreds of small paintings—too few, in the show, to sate my appetite for them—the young Oiticica rang startling changes, mixing homage and rivalry, on the styles of Mondrian, Malevich, and Klee.

By 1960, with like-minded compatriots including Lygia Pape (her own grand retrospective currently at the Met Breuer signals a corrective attention to Latin- American art), Oiticica had developed sculptural expansions of painting, with standing and suspended panels. Those led to his “Penetrables”—booths that could be entered—and “Bólides,” finely built wooden boxes with drawers or flaps that viewers could open to find various raw materials, mostly earthen. He took to frequenting Rio’s favelas, the direly impoverished hillside shantytowns that overlook the prosperous city. The improvisatory folk culture there inspired his “Parangolés”: garments for festive wear, mainly capes, that he stitched together from swaths and scraps of colorful fabric. With concerted study, he became an expert samba dancer. When, in 1965, Rio’s Museum of Modern Art barred entry to Parangolé-clad folk brought by Oiticica to dance at the opening of a show that he was in, the group disported outside in what became a legendary ad-hoc pageant. A military coup in Brazil in 1964 had ushered in a period of governmental oppression, which initially spared artistic activities. Needling of the junta by Oiticica and other artists—“Be an outlaw, be a hero,” he printed in black on a red banner with the image of a fallen youth—ended, in 1968, with a crackdown that drove many, including him, into exile. Like other aspects of his quicksilver character, his politics were ambiguous: leftist in general but what might be termed pop-aristocratic in effect. Jimi Hendrix became a guiding light to Oiticica at least as consequential as Marcel Duchamp.

“Creleisure,” Oiticica termed the principle of his sensual installation “Eden” at London’s Whitechapel Gallery, in 1969. The idea of Dionysian pleasure-seeking as a creative and, somehow, politically meaningful pursuit was much in the air then. (An observer at the Whitechapel show, perhaps in the mood for an orgy, deplored the no-fun restraint of British viewers.) But Oiticica was too tough-minded to indulge in hippieish peace and love. “Sex and Violence, That’s What I Like,” he had lettered on one Parangolé. His gayness became a driving personal cause and may have figured in his move, in 1970, with funds from a Guggenheim grant, to post-Stonewall New York, where he took an apartment on Second Avenue in the East Village. He relished the round-the-clock bacchanal of the West Side piers, photographed hustlers, and filmed the drag star Mario Montez. But he disdained the commercially oriented scene at Andy Warhol’s Factory for, he said, “raising marginal activity to a bourgeois level.” Insuring his own marginality, he took to dealing cocaine, a drug that became something like the love of his life. He gave varieties of it poetic names: Snows of Kilimanjaro, for one, and Carol Channing’s Diamonds, for another. In an undated, lovely still-life photograph, a little heap of the intoxicant rests on a box of Bold laundry detergent.

I never met Oiticica, as far as I can recall, though he lived three short blocks from me and knew artists whom I knew—notably the dazzling Gordon Matta-Clark—in a scrappy SoHo milieu that was minuscule by today’s standards. I get to sample at the Whitney what (perhaps luckily for me in the long run) I missed out on in the hermetic scene that Oiticica hosted. “CC5 Hendrix-War” (1973) is a room equipped with six comfortable hammocks. Projected on the walls and ceilings are overlapping slides of the cover of “War Heroes,” a posthumous Hendrix album, from 1972, as its thrilling songs play from multiple speakers. On the cover, decorating Hendrix’s face like war paint, are lines of cocaine. Cradled in a hammock the other day, I couldn’t imagine anywhere in the world I would rather be, tracking subtle variations in the changing slides: for example, a matchbook first closed, then open, then burning, then, finally, burned. The work’s form anticipates subsequent generations of installation artists, none of whom can beat it for immersive and bracing cogency. Of course, Oiticica’s blitzed afflatus was insane, as any former addict will tell you. After 1975, references to cocaine dwindled in his work.

Oiticica was a great one for planning. His buoyant writings in English, displayed in vitrines and seductively recited through earphones, hatch intricate Utopian schemes, often architectural in character. In 1971, he proposed one that involved labyrinthine spaces, for construction in Central Park, called “Subterranean Tropicália Projects.” Judging by the maquette in the show, I endorse reviving the idea. Oiticica’s feel for spatial arrangement and proportion, developed in his early painting and sculpture, is just about preternatural. Had he lived longer, we would likely be blessed with a number of landmark achievements in public art.

In 1978, weary of New York and of being harassed, for want of a green card, by U.S. immigration authorities, Oiticica returned to Rio. His last major work, “PN27 Penetrable, ‘Rijanviera’ ” (the title was taken from a coinage referring to Rio de Janeiro in “Finnegans Wake”), ends the Whitney show in a spirit of chastening ritual. Entering a pavilion that is made of translucent, subtly hued plastic panels, you wade through running water and emerge on soft sand, amid a rock garden. The work’s solemnity didn’t deter rowdies in 1979 who attended the show in Copacabana where it was introduced, incautiously augmented with blasting Hendrix music. When the installation’s water pump broke, flooding the gallery, a number of the viewers went wild, wrecking a nearby piece by Lygia Pape and forcing Oiticica to physically defend his own (he is said to have hit one vandal in the face with a rock). But the contretemps seems not to have marred his happiness at being back in Brazil—“free free free,” he wrote to a friend. When he died, he had a profusion of projects in development, and a future ahead of him that invites our imagining. ♦"
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/01/25/dead-certainty,newyorker,How “Making a Murderer” Went Wrong,[],"Argosy began in 1882 as a magazine for children and ceased publication ninety-six years later as soft-core porn for men, but for ten years in between it was the home of a true-crime column by Erle Stanley Gardner, the man who gave the world Perry Mason. In eighty-two novels, six films, and nearly three hundred television episodes, Mason, a criminal-defense lawyer, took on seemingly guilty clients and proved their innocence. In the magazine, Gardner, who had practiced law before turning to writing, attempted to do something similar—except that there his “clients” were real people, already convicted and behind bars. All of them met the same criteria: they were impoverished, they insisted that they were blameless, they were serving life sentences for serious crimes, and they had exhausted their legal options. Gardner called his column “The Court of Last Resort.” To help investigate his cases, Gardner assembled a committee of crime experts, including a private detective, a handwriting analyst, a former prison warden, and a homicide specialist with degrees in both medicine and law. They examined dozens of cases between September of 1948 and October of 1958, ranging from an African-American sentenced to die for killing a Virginia police officer after a car chase—even though he didn’t know how to drive—to a nine-fingered convict serving time for the strangling death of a victim whose neck bore ten finger marks. The man who didn’t know how to drive was exonerated, at least partly thanks to coverage in “The Court of Last Resort,” as were many others. Meanwhile, the never terribly successful Argosy also got a reprieve. “No one in the publishing field had ever considered the remote possibility that the general reading public could ever be so interested in justice,” Gardner wrote in 1951. “ Argosy’s circulation began to skyrocket.” Six years later, the column was picked up by NBC and turned into a twenty-six-episode TV series. Although it subsequently faded from memory, “The Court of Last Resort” stands as the progenitor of one of today’s most popular true-crime subgenres, in which reporters, dissatisfied with the outcome of a criminal case, conduct their own extrajudicial investigations. Until recently, the standout representatives of this form were “The Thin Blue Line,” a 1988 Errol Morris documentary about Randall Dale Adams, who was sentenced to death for the 1976 murder of a police officer; “Paradise Lost,” a series of documentaries by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky about three teen-agers found guilty of murdering three second-grade boys in West Memphis in 1993; and “The Staircase,” a television miniseries by Jean-Xavier de Lestrade about the novelist Michael Peterson, found guilty of murdering his wife in 2001. Peterson has been granted a new trial. Randall Dale Adams was exonerated a year after “The Thin Blue Line” was released. Shortly before the final “Paradise Lost” documentary was completed, in 2011, all three of its subjects were freed from prison on the basis of DNA evidence. In the past fifteen months, this canon has grown considerably in both content and prestige. First came “Serial,” co-created by Sarah Koenig and Julie Snyder, which revisited the case of Adnan Syed, convicted for the 1999 murder of his high-school classmate and former girlfriend, eighteen-year-old Hae Min Lee. That was followed by Andrew Jarecki’s “The Jinx,” a six-part HBO documentary that, uncharacteristically for the genre, sought to implicate rather than exonerate its subject, Robert Durst. A New York real-estate heir, Durst was acquitted in one murder case, is currently awaiting trial in another, and has long been suspected in the 1982 disappearance of his wife, Kathleen Durst. The latest addition to this canon is Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos’s “Making a Murderer,” a ten-episode Netflix documentary that examines the 2007 conviction of a Wisconsin man named Steven Avery. Like the prisoners featured in “The Court of Last Resort,” Avery is a poor man serving time for a violent crime that he insists he didn’t commit. The questions his story raises, however, are not just about his own guilt and innocence. Nearly seventy years have passed since Erle Stanley Gardner first tried a criminal case before the jury of the general public. Yet we still have not thought seriously about what it means when a private investigative project—bound by no rules of procedure, answerable to nothing but ratings, shaped only by the ethics and aptitude of its makers—comes to serve as our court of last resort.

If you know anything about “Making a Murderer,” you know that Steven Avery has a particularly troubling and convoluted relationship with the criminal-justice system. In July of 1985, Avery was picked up by the Manitowoc County Sheriff’s Department after a woman named Penny Beerntsen was brutally attacked while out for a run in a Wisconsin state park. Beerntsen, who had been conscious throughout most of the attack, deliberately sought to memorize her assailant’s features, and subsequently picked Avery out of both a photo array and a live lineup. At trial six months later, Avery was found guilty and sentenced to thirty-two years in prison. He served eighteen of those before being exonerated by DNA testing, a technology not available at the time of the trial. That DNA test also identified Beerntsen’s actual assailant: a man named Gregory Allen, who was, by then, imprisoned for another assault. This was bad news for the Manitowoc County Sheriff’s Department. As the public learned soon after the exoneration, local police had gone to the sheriff’s department within days after the attack to report that Allen may have been responsible; the department, convinced that it had the right man, declined to investigate. Ten years later, while serving time, Allen confessed to the assault. Again, the sheriff’s department was alerted and, again, no one acted; Avery remained in prison for another eight years. In light of this information, he filed a lawsuit against the county for thirty-six million dollars. In 2005, while the defendants in that civil suit were being deposed, Avery was arrested again—this time for the murder of a twenty-five-year-old photographer named Teresa Halbach. Four months later, his sixteen-year-old nephew, Brendan Dassey, was arrested as well, after he confessed to helping Avery rape and murder Halbach and burn her body. In 2007, after separate trials, both were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. Ricciardi and Demos examine those convictions in “Making a Murderer,” and the information they present has led viewers to respond with near-universal outrage about the verdicts. Because of the pending civil litigation, the Manitowoc County Sheriff’s Department was supposed to have nothing to do with the Halbach investigation beyond lending any necessary equipment to the jurisdiction in charge. Yet members of the department were involved in the case at every critical juncture. One of them was allegedly left alone with Halbach’s vehicle for several hours after it was located and before Avery’s blood was discovered inside. Another found the key to Halbach’s S.U.V. in Avery’s home—in plain view, even though the property had previously been searched by other investigators six times. A third found a bullet fragment in Avery’s garage, again after the premises had been repeatedly searched. The analyst who identified Halbach’s DNA on that bullet had been instructed by a county detective to try to come up with evidence that Halbach had been in Avery’s house or garage. Perhaps most damning, the defense discovered that a vial of Avery’s blood, on file from the 1985 case, had been tampered with; the outer and inner seal on the box in which it was kept had been broken, and the vial itself had a puncture in the top, as from a hypodermic needle. That is sobering stuff, but the most egregious misconduct shown in the documentary concerns not Avery but his nephew, Brendan Dassey—a stone-quiet, profoundly naïve, learning-disabled teen-ager with no prior criminal record, who is interrogated four times without his lawyer present. In the course of those interrogations, the boy, who earlier claimed to have no knowledge of Halbach, gradually describes an increasingly lurid torture scene that culminates in her murder by gunshot. The gun comes up only after investigators prod Dassey to describe what happened to Halbach’s head. Dassey first proposes that Avery cut off her hair, and then adds that his uncle punched her. Finally, one of the investigators, growing impatient, says, “I’m just going to come out and ask you: Who shot her in the head?” After the confession is signed, the prosecutor calls a press conference and turns Dassey’s story into the definitive account of what happened—a travesty of justice for Dassey and Avery, given the questionable nature of the interrogation, and a terrible cruelty to the Halbach family. Dassey repeatedly recanted his confession, including in a letter to the judge and on the witness stand. But it was too late. “Put the tape of his confession in the VCR or DVD player and play it, there’s our case right there,” Halbach’s brother told the press. He was right, but he shouldn’t have been. Most people find it impossible to imagine why anyone would confess to a crime he didn’t commit, but, watching Dassey’s interrogation, it is easy to see how a team of motivated investigators could alternately badger, cajole, and threaten a vulnerable suspect into saying what they wanted to hear. When Dassey’s mother asked him how he came up with so many details if he was innocent, he said, “I guessed.” “You don’t guess with something like this, Brendan,” she replied. “Well,” he said, “that’s what I do with my homework, too.”

By chance, I have known many of the details of the Avery case since long before the release of “Making a Murderer,” because in 2007 I spoke at length with Penny Beerntsen. At the time, I was working on a book about being wrong—about how we as a culture think about error, and how we as individuals experience it—and Beerntsen, in identifying Avery as her assailant, had been wrong in an unusually tragic and consequential way. Beerntsen had also been unusual among crime victims involved in wrongful convictions in that she had instantly accepted the DNA evidence—and, with it, her mistake. “It ain’t all her fault, you know,” Avery had said at the time of his release. “Honest mistake, you know.” But Beerntsen had felt horrifically guilty. “This might sound unbelievable,” she told me when we first talked, “ but I really feel this way: the day I learned I had identified the wrong person was much worse than the day I was assaulted. My first thought was, I don’t deserve to live.” She wrote Avery a letter, apologizing to him and his family, and, concerned by the missteps and misconduct that led to his incarceration, became involved with the Innocence Project, which seeks to free the wrongfully convicted and to reform legal practices to help prevent miscarriages of justice. Given her history, Beerntsen does not need any convincing that a criminal prosecution can go catastrophically awry. But when Ricciardi and Demos approached her about participating in “Making a Murderer” she declined, chiefly because, while her own experience with the criminal-justice system had led her to be wary of certitude, the filmmakers struck her as having already made up their minds. “It was very clear from the outset that they believed Steve was innocent,” she told me. “I didn’t feel they were journalists seeking the truth. I felt like they had a foregone conclusion and were looking for a forum in which to express it.” Ricciardi and Demos have dismissed that idea, claiming that they simply set out to investigate Avery’s case and didn’t have a position on his guilt or innocence. Yet “Making a Murderer” never provokes the type of intellectual and psychological oscillation so characteristic of Koenig and Snyder’s “Serial.” Instead, the documentary consistently leads its viewers to the conclusion that Avery was framed by the Manitowoc County Sheriff’s Department, and it contains striking elisions that bolster that theory. The filmmakers minimize or leave out many aspects of Avery’s less than savory past, including multiple alleged incidents of physical and sexual violence. They also omit important evidence against him, including the fact that Brendan Dassey confessed to helping Avery move Halbach’s S.U.V. into his junk yard, where Avery lifted the hood and removed the battery cable. Investigators subsequently found DNA from Avery’s perspiration on the hood latch—evidence that would be nearly impossible to plant. Perhaps because they are dodging inconvenient facts, Ricciardi and Demos are never able to present a coherent account of Halbach’s death, let alone multiple competing ones. Although “Making a Murderer” is structured chronologically, it fails to provide a clear time line of events, and it never answers such basic questions as when, where, and how Halbach died. Potentially critical issues are raised and summarily dropped; we hear about suspicious calls to and messages on Halbach’s cell phone, but these are never explored or even raised again. In the end, despite ten hours of running time, the story at the heart of “Making a Murderer” remains a muddle. Granted, real life is often a muddle, too, especially where crime is involved—but good reporters delineate the facts rather than contribute to the confusion. Despite all this, “Making a Murderer” has left many viewers entirely convinced that Avery was framed. After the documentary aired, everyone from high-school students to celebrities jumped on the “Free Avery and Dassey” bandwagon. In the weeks since, people involved in the conviction have been subjected to vicious and in some cases threatening messages from Netflix-watching strangers. (So have people who were not involved, including the Manitowoc Police Department, a separate entity from the county sheriff’s department.) For those people, and for others close to the original case, “Making a Murderer” seems less like investigative journalism than like highbrow vigilante justice. “My initial reaction was that I shouldn’t be upset with the documentarians, because they can’t help that the public reacted the way that it did,” Penny Beerntsen said. “But the more I thought about it, the more I thought, Well, yeah, they do bear responsibility, because of the way they put together the footage. To me, the fact that the response was almost universally ‘Oh, my God, these two men are innocent’ speaks to the bias of the piece. A jury doesn’t deliberate twenty-some hours over three or four days if the evidence wasn’t more complex.” “Making a Murderer” raises serious and credible allegations of police and prosecutorial misconduct in the trials of Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey. It also implies that that misconduct was malicious. That could be true; vindictive prosecutions have happened in our justice system before and they will happen again. But the vast majority of misconduct by law enforcement is motivated not by spite but by the belief that the end justifies the means—that it is fine to play fast and loose with the facts if doing so will put a dangerous criminal behind bars. That same reasoning, with the opposite aims, seems to govern “Making a Murderer.” But while people nearly always think that they are on the side of the angels, what finally matters is that they act that way. The point of being scrupulous about your means is to help insure accurate ends, whether you are trying to convict a man or exonerate him. Ricciardi and Demos instead stack the deck to support their case for Avery, and, as a result, wind up mirroring the entity that they are trying to discredit."
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/why-corrupt-bankers-avoid-jail,newyorker,Why Corrupt Bankers Avoid Jail,[],"In the summer of 2012, a subcommittee of the U.S. Senate released a report so brimming with international intrigue that it read like an airport paperback. Senate investigators had spent a year looking into the London-based banking group HSBC, and discovered that it was awash in skulduggery. According to the three-hundred-and-thirty-four-page report, the bank had laundered billions of dollars for Mexican drug cartels, and violated sanctions by covertly doing business with pariah states. HSBC had helped a Saudi bank with links to Al Qaeda transfer money into the United States. Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel, which is responsible for tens of thousands of murders, deposited so much drug money in the bank that the cartel designed special cash boxes to fit HSBC’s teller windows. On a law-enforcement wiretap, one drug lord extolled the bank as “ the place to launder money.” With four thousand offices in seventy countries and some forty million customers, HSBC is a sprawling organization. But, in the judgment of the Senate investigators, all this wrongdoing was too systemic to be a matter of mere negligence. Senator Carl Levin, who headed the investigation, declared, “This is something that people knew was going on at that bank.” Half a dozen HSBC executives were summoned to Capitol Hill for a ritual display of chastisement. Stuart Gulliver, the bank’s C.E.O., said that he was “profoundly sorry.” Another executive, who had been in charge of compliance, announced during his testimony that he would resign. Few observers would have described the banking sector as a hotbed of ethical compunction, but even by the jaundiced standards of the industry HSBC’s transgressions were extreme. Lanny Breuer, a senior official at the Department of Justice, promised that HSBC would be “held accountable.” What Breuer delivered, however, was the sort of velvet accountability to which large banks have grown accustomed: no criminal charges were filed, and no executives or employees were prosecuted for trafficking in dirty money. Instead, HSBC pledged to clean up its institutional culture, and to pay a fine of nearly two billion dollars: a penalty that sounded hefty but was only the equivalent of four weeks’ profit for the bank. The U.S. criminal-justice system might be famously unyielding in its prosecution of retail drug crimes and terrorism, but a bank that facilitated such activity could get away with a rap on the knuckles. A headline in the Guardian tartly distilled the absurdity: “HSBC ‘Sorry’ for Aiding Mexican Drug Lords, Rogue States and Terrorists.” In the years since the mortgage crisis of 2008, it has become common to observe that certain financial institutions and other large corporations may be “too big to jail.” The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, which investigated the causes of the meltdown, concluded that the mortgage-lending industry was rife with “predatory and fraudulent practices.” In 2011, Ray Brescia, a professor at Albany Law School who had studied foreclosure procedures, told Reuters, “I think it’s difficult to find a fraud of this size . . . in U.S. history.” Yet federal prosecutors filed no criminal indictments against major banks or senior bankers related to the mortgage crisis. Even when the authorities uncovered less esoteric, easier-to-prosecute crimes—such as those committed by HSBC—they routinely declined to press charges. This regime, in which corporate executives have essentially been granted immunity, is relatively new. After the savings-and-loan crisis of the nineteen-eighties, prosecutors convicted nearly nine hundred people, and the chief executives of several banks went to jail. When Rudy Giuliani was the top federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, he liked to march financiers off the trading floor in handcuffs. If the rules applied to mobsters like Fat Tony Salerno, Giuliani once observed, they should apply “to big shots at Goldman Sachs, too.” As recently as 2006, when Enron imploded, such titans as Jeffrey Skilling and Kenneth Lay were convicted of conspiracy and fraud. Something has changed in the past decade, however, and federal prosecutions of white-collar crime are now at a twenty-year low. As Jesse Eisinger, a reporter for ProPublica, explains in a new book, “The Chickenshit Club: Why the Justice Department Fails to Prosecute Executives” (Simon & Schuster), a financial crisis has traditionally been followed by a legal crackdown, because a market contraction reveals all the wishful accounting and outright fraud that were hidden when the going was good. In Warren Buffett’s memorable formulation, “You only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.” After the mortgage crisis, people in Washington and on Wall Street expected prosecutions. Eisinger reels off a list of potential candidates for criminal charges: Countrywide, Washington Mutual, Lehman Brothers, Citigroup, A.I.G., Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley. Although fines were paid, and the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission referred dozens of cases to prosecutors, there were no indictments, no trials, no jail time. As Eisinger writes, “Passing on one investigation is understandable; passing on every single one starts to speak to something else.” “Due to an earlier incident, this train is being held in the station. Please be patient—we will be moving shortly.”

One morning in February, 1975, a fifty-three-year-old businessman named Eli Black took the elevator to the forty-fourth floor of the Pan Am Building, in Manhattan. When he was alone in his corner office, Black slammed his attaché case into one of the big windows overlooking the city until the glass broke. Then he jumped out. Black was the chairman of United Brands, a multibillion-dollar conglomerate. After his death, friends speculated that he had been working too hard, but an alert investigator at the Securities and Exchange Commission, Stanley Sporkin, grew suspicious, noting that people don’t just “drop out of windows for no reason.” Black, it emerged, had become embroiled in a bribery scheme. United Brands owned Chiquita, and in exchange for a reduction of the export tax on bananas Black had authorized a two-and-a-half-million-dollar bribe to the President of Honduras. “White-collar crime,” in the definition of the sociologist who coined the term in the nineteen-thirties, is “committed by a person of respectability and high social status in the course of his occupation.” Eli Black fit the criteria. But he was dead. Sporkin, determined to secure justice, enlisted a young federal prosecutor in New York, Jed Rakoff, who devised a clever work-around: charge the whole company. Under U.S. law, it was technically possible to hold a company responsible for the actions of a single employee. With their inventive legal minds and their tenacious pursuit of malefactors, Sporkin and Rakoff are two of the heroes in Eisinger’s deeply reported account. United Brands ended up pleading guilty to conspiracy and wire fraud, and though it got off with a token fine of fifteen thousand dollars, Congress later cited the case when it passed the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in 1977. Before the United Brands scandal, prosecutors tended to go after white-collar crimes by indicting the executives who committed them; now they charged the firms themselves. But the notion of prosecuting a corporation raises a number of tricky questions. A company, as an eighteenth-century British jurist once remarked, has “no soul to be damned, and no body to be kicked.” Corporations can own property, sue people and be sued, even assert First Amendment rights. But you can’t put a corporation in jail. So you impose a fine. The trouble is that the employees responsible don’t pay the fine: if the company is publicly traded, the shareholders do. These individuals may have benefitted from the felonious conduct if it inflated the value of their stock, but they are innocent of any crime. The very conception of the modern corporation is that it limits individual liability. Yet, in the decades after the United Brands case, prosecutors often pursued both errant executives and the companies they worked for. When the investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert was suspected of engaging in stock manipulation and insider trading, in the nineteen-eighties, prosecutors levelled charges not just against financiers at the firm, including Michael Milken, but also against the firm itself. (Drexel Burnham pleaded guilty, and eventually shut down.) After the immense fraud at Enron was exposed, federal authorities pursued its accounting company, Arthur Andersen, for helping to cook the books. Arthur Andersen executives, desperate to cover their tracks, deleted tens of thousands of e-mails and shredded documents by the ton. In 2002, Arthur Andersen was convicted of obstruction of justice, and lost its accounting license. The corporation, which had tens of thousands of employees, was effectively put out of business. Eisinger describes the demise of Arthur Andersen as a turning point. Many lawyers, particularly in the well-financed realm of white-collar criminal defense, regarded the case as a flagrant instance of government overreach: the problem with convicting a company was that it could have “collateral consequences” that would be borne by employees, shareholders, and other innocent parties. “The Andersen case ushered in an era of prosecutorial timidity,” Eisinger writes. “Andersen had to die so that all other big corporations might live.” With plenty of encouragement from high-end lobbyists, a new orthodoxy soon took hold that some corporations were so colossal—and so instrumental to the national economy—that even filing criminal charges against them would be reckless. In 2013, Eric Holder, then the Attorney General, acknowledged that decades of deregulation and mergers had left the U.S. economy heavily consolidated. It was therefore “difficult to prosecute” the major banks, because indictments could “have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy.” Prosecutors came to rely instead on a type of deal, known as a deferred-prosecution agreement, in which the company would acknowledge wrongdoing, pay a fine, and pledge to improve its corporate culture. From 2002 to 2016, the Department of Justice entered into more than four hundred of these arrangements. Having spent a trillion dollars to bail out the banks in 2008 and 2009, the federal government may have been loath to jeopardize the fortunes of those banks by prosecuting them just a few years later. But fears of collateral consequences also inhibited the administration of justice in more run-of-the-mill instances of criminal money laundering. Some officials in the Department of Justice wanted to indict HSBC, according to e-mails unearthed by a subsequent congressional investigation. But Britain’s Chancellor of the Exchequer warned U.S. authorities that a prosecution could lead to “very serious implications for financial and economic stability.” HSBC was granted a deferred-prosecution agreement.

Numerous explanations have been offered for the failure of the Obama Justice Department to hold the big banks accountable: corporate lobbying in Washington, appeals-court rulings that tightened the definitions of certain types of corporate crime, the redirecting of investigative resources after 9/11. But Eisinger homes in on a subtler factor: the professional psychology of élite federal prosecutors. “The Chickenshit Club” is about a specific vocational temperament. When James Comey took over as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, in 2002, Eisinger tells us, he summoned his young prosecutors for a pep talk. For graduates of top law schools, a job as a federal prosecutor is a brass ring, and the Southern District of New York, which has jurisdiction over Wall Street, is the most selective office of them all. Addressing this ferociously competitive cohort, Comey asked, “Who here has never had an acquittal or a hung jury?” Several go-getters, proud of their unblemished records, raised their hands. But Comey, with his trademark altar-boy probity, had a surprise for them. “You are members of what we like to call the Chickenshit Club,” he said. “He’s all right, but I’m looking for a guy who can really make me laugh.” Most people who go to law school are risk-averse types. With their unalloyed drive to excel, the élite young attorneys who ascend to the Southern District have a lifetime of good grades to show for it. Once they become prosecutors, they are invested with extraordinary powers. In a world of limited public resources and unlimited wrongdoing, prosecutors make decisions every day about who should be charged and tried, who should be allowed to plead, and who should be let go. This is the front line of criminal justice, and decisions are made unilaterally, with no review by a judge. Even in the American system of checks and balances, there are few fetters on a prosecutor’s discretion. A perfect record of convictions and guilty pleas might signal simply that you’re a crackerjack attorney. But, as Comey implied, it could also mean that you’re taking only those cases you’re sure you’ll win—the lawyerly equivalent of enrolling in a gut class for the easy A. You might suppose that the glory of convicting a blue-chip C.E.O. would be irresistible. But taking such a case to trial entails serious risk. In contemporary corporations, the decision-making process is so diffuse that it can be difficult to establish criminal culpability beyond a reasonable doubt. In the United Brands case, Eli Black directly authorized the bribe, but these days the precise author of corporate wrongdoing is seldom so clear. Even after a provision in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, of 2002, began requiring C.E.O.s and C.F.O.s to certify the accuracy of corporate financial reports, few executives were charged with violating the law, because the companies threw up a thicket of subcertifications to buffer accountability. As Samuel Buell, who helped prosecute the Enron and Andersen cases and is now a law professor at Duke, points out in his recent book, “Capital Offenses: Business Crime and Punishment in America’s Corporate Age,” an executive’s claim that he believed he was following the rules often poses “a severe, even disabling, obstacle to prosecution.” That is doubly so in instances where the alleged crime is abstruse. Even the professionals who bought and sold the dodgy mortgage-backed instruments that led to the financial crisis often didn’t understand exactly how they worked. How do you explicate such transactions—and prove criminal intent—to a jury? Even with an airtight case, going to trial is always a gamble. Lose a white-collar criminal trial and you become a symbol of prosecutorial overreach. You might even set back the cause of corporate accountability. Plus, you’ll have a ding on your record. Eisinger quotes one of Lanny Breuer’s deputies in Washington telling a prosecutor, “If you lose this case, Lanny will have egg on his face.” Such fears can deter the most ambitious and scrupulous of young attorneys. The deferred-prosecution agreement, by contrast, is a sure thing. Companies will happily enter into such an agreement, and even pay an enormous fine, if it means avoiding prosecution. “That rewards laziness,” David Ogden, a Deputy Attorney General in the Obama Administration, tells Eisinger. “The department gets publicity, stats, and big money. But the enormous settlements may or may not reflect that they could actually prove the case.” When companies agree to pay fines for misconduct, the agreements they sign are often conspicuously stinting in details about what they did wrong. Many agreements acknowledge criminal conduct by the corporation but do not name a single executive or officer who was responsible. “The Justice Department argued that the large fines signaled just how tough it had been,” Eisinger writes. “But since these settlements lacked transparency, the public didn’t receive basic information about why the agreement had been reached, how the fine had been determined, what the scale of the wrongdoing was and which cases prosecutors never took up.” These pas de deux between prosecutors and corporate chieftains came to feel “stage-managed, rather than punitive.”

White-collar crime is not the only area in which prosecutors show reluctance to risk a trial. By the time Comey issued his Chickenshit Club admonition, a deeper shift in the administration of justice was already under way. Faced with the challenges of entrusting any criminal case to a jury, prosecutors were increasingly skipping trial altogether, negotiating a plea bargain instead. With the introduction of stiff sentencing guidelines, prosecutors routinely “up charged” crimes, requesting maximal prison sentences in the event of a conviction at trial. Defendants can be risk-averse, too. Offered the choice between, say, pleading guilty and serving three to five years, or going to trial and serving ten if convicted, many opt for the former. But, as with corporate deferred-prosecution agreements, these arrangements grant prosecutors a victory without testing their evidence in court. Rachel Barkow, a law professor at N.Y.U., has pointed out that when you threaten defendants with Draconian sentences if they refuse to plead guilty “you penalize people who have the nerve to go to trial.” Some scholars argue that such prosecutorial bullying may violate the Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury. (In 2014, a federal judge in Colorado declared that, for most Americans, this constitutional right is now “a myth.”) The criminal trial is increasingly becoming a relic. More than ninety-five per cent of all criminal cases at both the state and the federal level are now resolved in plea bargains. A recent article in the Times described vacant courtrooms, out-of-work stenographers, and New York judges who can go a year or more without hearing a single criminal case. It may be no accident that the vanishing of the criminal trial has coincided with Eisinger’s story of vanishing corporate accountability. Presenting a case to a jury is a skill, and prosecutors now have fewer opportunities to hone it. The less adept you are in the courtroom, the more intimidated you will be by the prospect of going to trial, making you more likely to opt for a plea agreement instead. This phenomenon has broader societal consequences. As John Pfaff demonstrates in his recent book, “Locked In,” one grave result of the tremendous leverage that prosecutors exert is the rise of mass incarceration. As judges and juries are written out of the criminal-justice equation, an awful paradox has emerged: the poor sign plea bargains and go to jail; the privileged sign deferred-prosecution agreements and avoid it. This is a curious state of affairs, given that the notion of deferring criminal prosecution was originally introduced to benefit individuals, not corporations. During the nineteen-sixties, pilot programs in New York and Washington, D.C., demonstrated that when charges were suspended for ninety days, so that low-income defendants who had been arrested for nonviolent crimes could obtain counselling and job-placement services, offenders often turned their lives around to a point where the charges were dropped. This approach was both humane and efficient, in that it diverted people from the costly prison system. Among those who completed the program, few were arrested again. In 1974, following the success of such initiatives, the deferred-prosecution agreement was incorporated into federal law. It is a pernicious irony that a progressive legal instrument designed to help working-class defendants stay out of jail has been repurposed as a vehicle for facilitating corporate impunity. As the federal judge Emmet Sullivan noted in 2015, “Drug conspiracy defendants are no less deserving of a second chance than bribery conspiracy defendants.” Yet these days the Department of Justice seldom offers this form of clemency to the kinds of individuals for whom the practice was conceived. Perhaps, as Eric Holder has argued, there is simply more at stake when the defendant is a major bank. But what about the collateral consequences of showing less mercy when prosecuting low-income individuals? When you charge someone with a felony and send him to prison, the repercussions radiate outward, through his family and his community. Nearly three million American children have a parent in prison. According to the Rutgers criminologist Todd Clear, low-income neighborhoods in which a large proportion of the population cycles in and out of confinement experience greater familial dysfunction, warped labor markets, and a general lack of “mental and physical health.” Entire communities bear the brunt of our zealous approach to less rarefied varieties of crime. Prosecutors and judges seldom regard those collateral costs as a rationale for leniency."

The elevator, once a marvel of efficiency, has become a social purgatory from which most of us cannot escape too quickly. The builders of the first commercial airplane couldn’t have foreseen the crushed knees and the splattered salad dressings that their machine would visit on the world. “Hitherto it is questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the day’s toil of any human being,” John Stuart Mill wrote in the “Principles of Political Economy” (1848), and the precept holds for recent innovations, too. Think of e-mail. Or, rather, try not to think of e-mail, since, chances are, while you floss, steep tea, make love, or read these sentences, new messages are proliferating in your inbox, colonizing your time and your brain. Sure thing, you type back to a needy stranger who seems unable to punctuate. Sounds good. Actually, it sounds like death. Once upon a time, you knew that you could log off e-mail and, like Cinderella before midnight, gain a few hours of deliverance from the day’s digital scut work. Now your inbox nags you on your smartphone, and the only prince who might help is Nigerian, with a need to stow his fortune somewhere safe. Add to this the knowledge that your e-mail self is probably your worst. “Exposure of my emails would reveal not only deep fears and worries, but also my shallow personality,” the writer Delia Ephron fretted in a comic essay, after Sony, where she’d done business, had its accounts hacked. That was in 2014, and the stakes of inbox security have risen since, even as standards of conduct grow vague. By some accounts, it was a popular obsession with Hillary Clinton’s inbox which cost her the election. By others, it was WikiLeaks’ release of messages from the Democratic National Committee. E-mails from the Vice-President’s former account showed up in March (divulging the Second Lady’s private contact information), and, in May, hackers delivered a cache from Emmanuel Macron’s campaign inboxes in the apparent hope of swaying voters. (The press held back, and the people of France, who appear to prefer their epistolary scandals served blue, shrugged.) E-mail made the news again last week, when the Times reported that a message from 2016 offered Donald Trump, Jr., opposition information from Russia. Then Trump fils released his e-mail thread online. Given that e-mail leaks can imperil governments, it seems odd that correspondents spend so little time reviewing basic work before they press send. Writing, along with fire-making and the invention of the wheel, is widely held to be a milestone of human progress. This view will seem naïve to anybody who has read much human writing. In its feral form, prose is unhinged, mystifying, and repetitive. Writers feel moved to “get things down on paper,” usually incoherently, and even in guarded moods say alarming stuff because they don’t know where to put their commas. (“Time to eat children!”) The true wellspring of civilization isn’t writing; it is editing. E-mail, produced in haste, rarely receives the requisite attention. That is bad for us but good for posterity—and for students of the literary gestures we imprudently put in pixels. When inboxes are gathered, cracked open, and studied, they become a searchable, sortable atlas for the contours of our social minds.

Not long after the Enron Corporation imploded amid revelations of accounting fraud, in 2001, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission seized the e-mail folders of a hundred and fifty-one mostly high-ranking employees, the better to discover the discoverable. Before long, the commission made a startling announcement: it would release this body of e-mail online, to substantiate its findings. “The release of the information now will enable the public to understand better the evidentiary record on which the Commission’s decisions in those proceedings are grounded,” it explained. “The Commission may release the information if the public’s right to disclosure outweighs the individual’s right to privacy.” The Enron archive came to comprise hundreds of thousands of messages, and remains one of the country’s largest private e-mail corpora turned public. Its lasting value is less as an account of Enron’s daywork than as a social and linguistic data pool, a record of the way we write online when we’re not preening for the public eye. Like a hot-dog bun beset by seagulls, the archive has been pulled apart and pecked up; it has been digested by computers and referred to by more than three thousand academic papers. This makes it, in the annals of scholarship, something strange: a canonic research text that no one has actually read. Mostly, that’s because it is too long, and too boring, for complete human consumption. When the e-mails were released, in 2003, the dump was more jumbled than even computers could handle, so a researcher at M.I.T. purchased the bundle and, with help, began to put it in a processable order. Folder structures were reinstated. Redundancies, automated messages from Listservs, delivery-failure notices, and other pieces of modern detritus were trimmed away. The resulting corpus, down to a few hundred thousand e-mails, helped to mark a shift in research premise from the cult of authorship (these texts are interesting because a notable mind made them) to the cult of the commons (these texts are interesting because of what, together, they show). The things they show frequently serve the cause of automation. One of the first projects to employ the Enron corpus was a self-described “extensive benchmark study of e-mail foldering.” It used seven large accounts to help determine whether people organized their e-mail in ways that might be replicable by machine intelligence. (“Email foldering is a rich and interesting task,” the study’s lead author, Ron Bekkerman, noted, in what may be the paper’s most surprising conclusion.) The answer was not yet: people are too idiosyncratic in the ways they organize their stuff. Another team used the corpus to develop a “compliance bot” that could identify sensitive elements in text and alert writers if a message might get them in trouble. These endeavors served a basic purpose: protecting users from their foolishness. Other studies focussed on Enron itself. Noting that “a small number of users have sent a large number of messages”—a fact that will shock no one who gets e-mail at work—one research team mapped epistolary ties on a Gower layout (a connect-the-dots plot) to understand who was in contact with whom. They found a tight nest of connections around Enron’s president, vice-president, and C.E.O. Angled off to either side were ears with more remote networks of traders, managers, and lawyers. The plot looks like a donkey head. It also looks more or less like what you’d expect. The corpus rapidly highlights the difference between rich data and useful information. An M.I.T. student working on a compliance bot noted that it seemed nearly impossible to identify evidence of financial misconduct using basic search strings. He had more success tracking down pornography—of which there was, oddly, a lot—with words like “sex.” Also, it was easy to find racial slurs.

Computers can do little with a text that humans could not, but they make some laborious work go faster. In 1949, an Italian Jesuit priest named Roberto Busa presented a pitch to Thomas J. Watson, of I.B.M. Busa was trained in philosophy, and had just published his thesis on St. Thomas Aquinas, the Catholic theologian with a famously unmanageable œuvre. (Work on a multivolume critical edition of Aquinas’s philosophy, commissioned by the Vatican, began in 1879 and is nowhere near done.) Busa had begun to wonder whether Watson’s computing machines could aid his work. Watson backed him, and, for the next thirty years, Busa encoded sixty-five thousand pages of Thomist text so that it could be word-searched, cross-referenced, and what we now call hyperlinked. The Index Thomisticus was the first corpus to be primed for digital scholarship, no less impressive because it started on punch cards and ended up online. “ Digitus Dei est hic! ” Busa punned in 2004. The finger of God is here. By then, using computers to assess large bodies of written text had turned to profane projects. Computational linguistics, the study of computer-replicable rules and patterns in real-world language, began in earnest in the nineteen-fifties, originally in the service of Cold War intelligence: the United States wanted to use computers to mass-translate Russian texts into English. (The U.S.S.R., of course, wanted the opposite.) By the late sixties, the endeavor had reached literary commerce. Houghton Mifflin used the so-called Brown corpus, a body of five hundred varied texts from 1961, to produce the first edition of the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, in 1969: one of the earliest reference guides that included descriptive information about the way words were actually deployed in print. Research on so-called corpus linguistics revealed some puzzling properties of usage. In the thirties, the linguist George Kingsley Zipf had posited that a word’s frequency is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table—the third most common word would show up one-third as often as the most common word, and on—and the Brown corpus and others have appeared to bear this out. Zipfian projections are inexact, especially far down the table, but the curve seems to hold broadly. It is unclear why. A field known as digital humanities has emerged around text-crunching analysis in its modern form. A key advocate of the method, Willard McCarty, touted computers’ virtues as “modelling machines”: they can test and discard working theories without years of exploratory work. Textual mapping is a popular function; a recent project, in Denmark, used artificial intelligence to comb through thirty thousand witchy folktales and geographically plot their elements. (It revealed, among other things, that witchcraft allegations in Protestant Denmark tended to arise in the vicinity of Catholic monasteries.) And, because computers are great at searching, they have been a boon for stylistics: the study of the words, phrases, or images that recur across a work. Such analysis, in its eccentric span, includes Robots Reading Vogue , a project at Yale’s Digital Humanities Lab which, drawing on archived correspondence, gins up memos in the scattered style of Diana Vreeland. “Also small stones, small straps. It would be interesting, and Diane de Mere, etc., . . . The marvelous summer look,” some computer-generated Vreelandisms read. Although the project is amusing, coming up with nonsense is the one thing with which humans need no help. Still, these behavior-patterning approaches produce insights when applied to the Enron corpus. A pair of researchers at Queen’s University, in Canada, had some success applying “deception theory”: the idea is that disingenuous e-mailers tend to minimize first-person pronouns, use more negative-emotion and action words, and write with “an excessive blandness.” Their search turned up a number of misconduct-related e-mails, although further analysis was still required as a final filter. “It’s not nepotism if I’m the best son for the job.” Other projects got more specific. A 2011 study from the University of Washington crawled through the e-mails to see how tonal formality tracked onto the nature of a message, rank difference, social familiarity, and the number of recipients. Most results were unsurprising: people e-mailed more formally when dealing with business, across a gap in rank, with people they scarcely knew, and to a bigger audience. Oddly, though, e-mails grew more informal as the list of addressees expanded beyond ten. The researchers hypothesized that people like to strike a slouchy pose before big workplace audiences, the better to seem the cool kid in a class of dweebs.

In the way that years have springtimes, most epistolary careers have a swell. Maybe yours came in July, at camp, when 4 p.m. felt like a lonely hour. Maybe it started in the season that arrives after a failure or a death, or in the crisp evening that closes a lucky day. Mine arrived when I was a college exchange student in France: four classes, few friends, and a shared apartment across from a fire station where, most mornings, pompiers paraded out onto the sidewalk to unroll, and then reroll, their hoses. I would go to a creaking amphitheatre to watch a lecture by a preening giant of French literary theory. I would continue to a small room where a scholar with a prim, babylike mouth read verbatim from an outline, which the students dutifully copied onto pristine quadrille paper using fountain pens. At lunchtime, I’d sit in the park with a €2.80 sandwich and write letters across the tops, bottoms, and backs of greeting cards, descanting on random but—I believed—revealing details. The French magazines photographed intellectuals in odalisque poses, I’d report. The stations on the Clignancourt-Orléans line smelled like baking yams. When I think back on this period, what strikes me most is how fresh my flint was, how the lightest brush with a larger world could scatter sparks, smoke up my eyes, burn through hundreds of words. My e-mails, horrifyingly, would run longer still. The Enron corpus seems unburdened by such correspondence. “Where are you right now? i am in london,” Greg Whalley, the company’s president after Jeff Skilling’s departure, wrote a colleague inquiring about a meeting. “Congratulations! Keep up the good work,” Teb Lokey, a manager for regulatory affairs, tells an employee. (That is the whole message.) An analyst found about half of the e-mails to be one sentence long, and those that run on aren’t always more substantive. When the Enron corpus first became available, some people described its catalogue of tics and corporatese as “cliché”—less embarrassing to Enron, possibly, than to the species. (Who among us has not stood atop millennia of human language and, after a moment of reflection, signed an e-mail “Best”?) To the extent that “cliché” is another word for recurring cultural pattern, these platitudes are exactly what computer analysis embraces. In 2014, an enterprising business-English teacher named Evan Frendo had the idea of using the corpus to locate phrases helpful to the foreign businessperson working with Americans. After what must have been punishing study, he discovered a fixation on “ball” metaphors. “I thought I’d get the ball rolling,” one Enroner wrote. “Sounds like you guys had a ball at dinner,” another said. “I played hard ball and told them that I had to have more time,” a correspondent reported. “Someone REALLY dropped the ball here!” an employee chides. “From June 1, we will be totally on the ball,” reads an e-mail that you don’t believe. “I will pretty much leave it in your ball park about Friday night,” somebody writes (a message that Frendo correctly annotates “???”). All told, the corpus contained six hundred and two instances of ball speech, apparently covering every scenario in modern American business. It is not clear that this compendium eases the task of the Danish banker on a morning flight to Dallas. But perhaps it tells him where to focus his study. Naomi Lancaster, a graduate student at Ball State University (!), established that Enroners didn’t generally open with “Dear,” as most etiquette guides suggest, and favored “Hey,” “Hi,” or “Hello,” leading Lancaster to believe that the etiquette proxy for e-mail wasn’t written letters but speech. Only six per cent of the e-mails she examined had any greeting at all; most began in medias res. The employees most likely to use a friendly greeting were women not in positions of authority, followed by men in subservient positions. Powerful men were the most likely just to open an e-mail window and start typing. In some cases, an e-mail would simply be addressed “Guys.” The challenge of beginnings is not particular to e-mail—nor are its gender condescensions new. “Strange as it may seem, we continue to receive letters from people interested in the problem—broached by us last June—of the correct salutation to use in a letter to a girls’ school,” E. B. White and Elizabeth Hawes wrote in the Notes and Comment department of this magazine, in 1931: First there is a communication from Thomas O. Mabbott, Ph.D., assistant professor at Hunter College, who says that the head of his department writes, “Dear Colleagues.” . . . An etiquette writer in the World-Telegram, propounding the same problem, by a funny coincidence, advises the use of the French “Mesdames,” followed, the writer goes on, “by the customary dash.” A man in Baltimore writes that the Governor of the Virgin Islands once wrote a letter to Goucher College beginning: “To the director of one group of virgins from another,” which we neither believe nor think funny. A letter, like the social speech for which it substitutes, is frayed by awkwardness at either end. We spend half of our lives struggling to start conversations and the other half struggling to exit them. In the middle is the thing itself, and here, it turns out, we are slightly better than machines. What is sometimes called “sentiment” or “tone” analysis presents a challenge for computers, which can stumble over simple words. Consider “pretty”: it can intensify some descriptions (“The hot dog was pretty amazing, but the bun was pretty dry”), dial back others (“That Zumba class was pretty good, I guess”), convey beauty (“What a pretty wooden trellis!”), or add irony (“What a pretty kettle of fish”). The limits of corpus analysis, in other words, are human; in the gap between data and knowledge, we fall back on our social understandings of the world. This recourse can help computers with complex use cases, such as “pretty.” But when help is supposed to flow from machine to human, we can end up gazing into a mirror, not a clarifying lens. Like the work of the midcentury structuralist anthropologists, corpus analysis purports to pattern-seek dispassionately. The endeavor, though, requires focussing on certain patterns over others, and imbuing them with a relational logic based on what’s already known. We learn as much about our social selves in the act of interpreting the Enron corpus as we do in the e-mails themselves. Behind the meaning of the commons, there’s an author still."
http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/from-the-mixed-up-files-of-mrs-basil-e-frankweiler-fifty-years-later,newyorker,"“From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler,” Fifty Years Later",[],"The first paragraph of E. L. Konigsburg’s 1967 book “ From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler ,” about two young runaways who become entangled in an art-historical mystery, is a masterpiece of graceful, efficient exposition:

Claudia knew that she could never pull off the old-fashioned kind of running away. That is, running away in the heat of anger with a knapsack on her back. She didn’t like discomfort; even picnics were untidy and inconvenient: all those insects and the sun melting the icing on the cupcakes. Therefore, she decided that her leaving home would not be just running from somewhere but would be running to somewhere. To a large place, a comfortable place, an indoor place, and preferably a beautiful place. And that’s why she decided upon the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

After just six sentences, the reader knows Claudia intimately, and is ready to go to the Met.

On Saturday, that’s where I went. The Met was offering two dedicated tours in honor of Konigsburg’s beloved book, which turns fifty this year. The hour-long trek, advertised for kids aged seven to eleven, was free with museum admission and first come, first served. (There were also “Mixed-Up Files”-themed cookies at the café in the American Wing, and a selfie station for recreating the book cover, which Claudia, no doubt, would have regarded as gauche.) Around 1:30 P.M. , having obtained clearance to attend the second tour as an unaccompanied adult, I walked up the museum steps, wading through strollers and selfie sticks. In the “Mixed-Up Files,” Claudia and her brother Jamie—chosen as her travelling companion because of the twenty-four-dollar fortune he’s amassed by cheating at cards—take a train from Connecticut to Grand Central Terminal and walk all the way uptown. As they approach the perpetual hubbub outside the museum, Jamie becomes convinced of the wisdom of Claudia’s plan. “I think you’re brilliant, Claude. New York is a great place to hide out. No one notices no one,” he says. (Despite the compliment, his sister corrects his grammar immediately; both Claudia’s pedantry and her pathological independence insured that the young me would deeply identify with her.)

Claudia and Jamie spend a week hiding in the Met, scattering their possessions among various urns and sarcophagi, crouching on top of toilets when the guards patrol at night. Their caper can’t be perfectly retraced anymore: the chapel where they say a desultory prayer was closed, in 2001, and the ornate canopy bed that Claudia slept in has been dismantled, to many a visitor’s chagrin . On Saturday, our tour guide distributed a handout comparing the museum’s floor plan in the nineteen-sixties, which appears across two pages in Konigsburg’s book, to the expanded floor plan today. Undeterred, we walked through the Greek and Roman galleries and sat down in front of the ancient sarcophagus in which Claudia hides her violin case.

We were sitting, the guide explained, in a hall that was, when Konigsburg wrote her book, a restaurant, with tables surrounding a large central pool. Inside the pool was a bronze sculpture of whimsical dancing figures—the “Fountain of the Muses,” which was sculpted by Carl Milles and now resides outdoors, in South Carolina. In the “Mixed-Up Files,” Claudia and Jamie take baths in the pool one night. Our guide read from the scene, in which Claudia and Jamie climb “under the velvet rope that meant that the restaurant was closed to the public. Of course they were not the public.” It’s a delightful scene, combining the pleasures of being naked in public, of unexpectedly profiting—as Claudia scrubs herself down with the powdered soap she’s been hoarding from the public restroom, Jamie discovers the trove of wishing coins on the floor of the pool—and, above all, of getting away with something, which remains the underlying thrill of the book.

Elaine Lobl Konigsburg was an unpublished stay-at-home mother of three when she started working on the “Mixed-Up Files.” (She would eventually write twenty-one books and win two Newbery Medals, for the “Mixed-Up Files” and for the brilliant “ The View from Saturday ,” published in 1996.) Back then, on Saturdays, she would take the train down from Port Chester for art lessons and drop her kids off at the Met. She’d meet them at the museum afterward. One day, as they were walking through a gallery of French furniture, she saw, behind a velvet rope, a single piece of popcorn on a blue silk chair. When Konigsburg died, in 2013, the Metropolitan Museum of Art hosted a private event in her remembrance, and her son Paul recalled his mother wondering aloud about that piece of popcorn. The moment was “ burned into shrapnel memory ” for her, he said, and it provided the kernel, so to speak, of the whole book.

There were other real-life inspirations for the “Mixed-Up Files.” The book features a small angel statue, possibly sculpted by Michelangelo, that attracts huge lines of museumgoers each day. Konigsburg took her inspiration for the crowds from the 1963 visit of the “Mona Lisa” to the museum, which drew a million people in three and a half weeks, and her inspiration for the object from an article she’d read in the Times about a statue that the museum had acquired at auction, for two hundred and twenty-five dollars, from the estate of a woman named Mrs. A. Hamilton Rice. In the book, Claudia and Jamie become amateur art historians, investigating the provenance of this piece; Claudia, in particular, becomes obsessed with the statue. (In real life, curators eventually concluded that the sculptor wasn’t Michelangelo; Konigsburg gives her characters a happier ending.) On Saturday, our tour guide sat the kids down in front of a Michelangelo statue of Cupid and asked if there were any ten-year-olds in the crowd. Hands shot up. Eleven-year-olds? There were a few. “Well, Michelangelo was just fifteen when he sculpted this statue,” she said. The kids looked universally dismayed.

On the train home, I reread the thirty-fifth-anniversary edition of the “Mixed-Up Files,” which I had picked up at the museum gift shop. It was even better than I remembered. It’s very sophisticated, with the deep story unfolding subtly under the narrative surface. In a short, mysterious prologue, Konigsburg’s wry narrator announces herself as Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, and then drops clues about the story in parenthetical asides, addressed to her lawyer, which begin on the third page: “(Since you always drive to the city, Saxonberg, you probably don’t know the cost of train fare. I’ll tell you. . . .)” In one of these asides, she suddenly tightens the loop for the reader—“(And that, Saxonberg, is how I enter the story. Claudia and Jamie Kincaid came to see me about Angel.)”

The Q train kept stopping. I was struck by how tenderly Konigsburg wrote Claudia and Jamie—readers will remember the pleasure and financial anxiety of each meal they take at the Automat—and by the humor she found in their voices. Claudia’s main reason for running away is, vaguely, “injustice,” and when the narration shifts to Jamie’s perspective Konigsburg uses “sculpture” as a verb. But there is no sentimentality in the book. The kids aren’t homesick for their parents, they don’t romanticize the museum, and there’s not a hint of moral instruction throughout the whole thing. They do have their adventures: at one point, they rent a post-office box and send the Met an anonymous letter, which they type on a display Olivetti that’s sitting out on Fifth Avenue; they even get a reply. But, as Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler tells Claudia, the real adventure is coming home with a secret. “Secrets are the kind of adventure she needs,” Frankweiler says. It’s an adult conclusion, complicated and true.

I got off the train and kept reading as I walked, the way I used to when I was a kid. I banged into a bus stop on Myrtle Avenue and flinched when tree leaves brushed my cheek. Somehow, I reached the last page just as I got to my stoop. Museum guards had discovered a violin case and a trumpet case and sent these odd objects to lost-and-found. “They are still there,” Konigsburg writes. “Full of gray-washed underwear and a cheap transistor radio. No one has claimed them yet.”"
http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/are-we-nearing-the-endgame-with-isis,newyorker,Are We Nearing the Endgame with ISIS?,[],"The American diplomat Brett McGurk is the central player in the seventy-two-nation coalition fighting the Islamic State, a disparate array of countries twice the size of NATO . He has now worked all of America’s major wars against extremism—in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria—under three very different Presidents: George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and now Donald Trump. McGurk served in Baghdad after the ouster of Saddam Hussein; he used his experience clerking for the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist on the Supreme Court to help draft Iraq’s new constitution. President Bush brought McGurk back to Washington to serve on the National Security Council and help run the campaign against Al Qaeda. President Obama tapped him to work Iraq and Iran at the State Department. McGurk was visiting Kurdistan, in northern Iraq, when ISIS seized nearby Mosul. In 2015, he became Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS . President Trump kept him on.

In a sign of how fast the Islamic State is shrinking, McGurk last month visited northern Syria. I called on him Wednesday, at his small whitewashed office on the ground floor of the State Department, to assess the future of ISIS and the world’s most unconventional nation. McGurk is an optimist, long-term, despite the chorus of skeptics in Washington about extremism, Iraq and Syria, and U.S. foreign policy in the volatile Middle East. The interview has been edited and condensed. McGurk’s most chilling answer was when he talked about how many ISIS fighters are still alive.

Where is ISIS ? The leaders? The fighters? Intelligence assessments claim that at least twenty per cent of the fighters have returned to their countries of origin, with some exceptions like Britain, where it may be as high as fifty per cent. Where are they going as they face defeat?

We had forty thousand foreign fighters come into Syria from over a hundred and ten countries, as far away as China. The reason Mosul was so difficult in the final three weeks of battle was because we had hundreds of foreign fighters in the Old City barricaded in civilian structures. Our guys could hear them on the radio speaking Chinese, Russian, Dutch, French.

Did some foreign fighters get out before we had the borders sealed? Yes. Now it is extremely difficult. Foreign fighters who are in Iraq and Syria are going to die in Iraq and Syria. Mosul is now finished. Raqqa is surrounded.

[The American-backed] Syrian Democratic Forces have cleared about forty per cent of the city. [ ISIS fighters] are concentrating now in small towns along a little span of the Euphrates River that crisscrosses the Iraq and Syria border in the middle of nowhere. These guys used to plan major attacks in Raqqa, with the infrastructure of a city, and then send teams to conduct attacks in Paris and Brussels. They can’t do that anymore.

How many ISIS fighters are still active? And where?

Our experts think the active cadre of ISIS fighters is down to twelve thousand total fighters, local and foreign. The Syrian Democratic Forces, the force we are working with, is incredibly brave. They are going into these high-rise buildings, room by room, floor by floor, to root these guys out.

Is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the ISIS caliph, alive? And what is he doing?

This is someone who cannot show his face. He communicates by audiotapes, like we are back in the nineteen-nineties. He has dramatically tainted his claim to any legitimacy. Whether or not he is alive, we do not know. But his command and control over this organization is severed.

What is the U.S. military role after the caliphate collapses?

Our coalition has trained a hundred thousand members of the Iraqi security force that had collapsed in 2014. They have now fought some of the most difficult battles since the Second World War. We are in discussions with the Iraqi government about a future role for the coalition training and advising. In Syria, we have also pioneered this model of working by, with, and through local forces. It’s local Syrians retaking their areas. Our footprint is small, it’s light, but it is effective. We will want to be able to keep the pressure so that ISIS can’t regenerate.

So air strikes will continue?

If we see an ISIS leader or something, we will retain the right. In this campaign, coalition-enabled operations have cleared out a total of sixty thousand square kilometres [roughly twenty-three thousand square miles]. We liberated almost five million people. ISIS has not retaken a single square kilometre. This is not the day when you go clear, but can’t hold, and the enemy comes back. The model that we are using appears to be sustainable.

So, is ISIS going to come back? They’ll always be around as small terrorist cells. We want to make sure the Iraqis are able to handle that. But in terms of ISIS being able to regenerate as a force that can take and seize territory as it could in 2014, I just don’t think they’ll ever retain that capability.

Fourteen years after the U.S. intervention, in 2003, Iraq still does not have a political deal to share power among sectarian and ethnic factions. How does Iraq solve an issue as important to the future of the country as the military campaign?

I resist the notion that because there wasn’t some political deal in Baghdad, the Sunnis decided to put their lot with ISIS . That is simplistic. ISIS came into Sunni areas and anyone who didn’t agree with their twisted vision was murdered. Sunnis were the largest victims of ISIS .

The government of Iraq has a policy of decentralization, empowering people at the local level to restore life to their communities. Iraq will have an election, probably in May of next year. The divisions in Iraqi society now are not so much Sunni-Shia. There are big divisions among the different Shia groups and inter-Sunni. Frankly, some Sunni tribes sided with ISIS in 2014. In these communities, there isn’t a get-out-of-jail-free card.

There have been a lot of revenge killings.

Probably not as many as had been predicted, but yes. It’s impossible to have a totally clean aftermath.

Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said that the Popular Mobilization Forces, predominantly Shiite militias, weren’t allowed in Mosul, but I saw their pickup trucks—with big flags waving sayings from the Quran—all over town. How much of a concern is the unleashing of the P.M.F., now and down the road?

The P.M.F. arose from a fatwa issued by Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani in the worst days of 2014, when it looked like Baghdad could fall. He issued a fatwa for able-bodied males to help save the country. About eighty per cent have proved to be quite disciplined; they operate under control of the state. About twenty per cent of them are not. That includes some Shia militia groups. It also includes some Sunni groups that have discipline problems. Given the terrain that Iraq had to cover during the Mosul campaign, there was some necessity for the Popular Mobilization Forces. This is an issue that the Iraqi government has to get its arms around.

Since 2003, Iran has played an increasing role in Iraq. How do you assess their intentions down the road and their power compared to the U.S.?

Iran likes to be flattered with the view that everything that happens in Iraq and Syria happens because Iran is pulling the strings. That’s just not true. Do they have enormous influence? Yes. Just look at a map and you can understand why. But the differences, even within the Shia community in Iraq and the Shia community in Iran, are profound. The vision of [Iraq’s] Grand Ayatollah Sistani —of quietism and a civil state, meaning not a state governed by clerics—is totally different from the vision of [Iran’s] Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. The Iranians tried to do a number of things in Iraq that simply have not worked, because the Iraqis rejected it. Their influence is not dominant. I never discount the ability of the Iraqis to chart their own course.

Al Qaeda has consolidated its hold over Idlib, the last Syrian province beyond the regime’s control. How worried are you about Al Qaeda’s rise in the jihadi world as ISIS is collapsing?

I’m very concerned about Idlib. Trends apparent for some time culminated over the last couple of weeks, with the dominant Al Qaeda movement taking the main border crossings and populated areas. We have to make sure Al Qaeda-linked fighters cannot get in and out. We are going to have to work with the Turks and others to degrade this presence. This is not something that’s spreading. But, within Idlib, Al Qaeda is working hard to take the reins of power.

Raqqa is the caliphate’s capital. Who rules it after the defeat of ISIS ? Is it like Mosul, returning to government control—President Bashar al-Assad—or is it like Berlin, where different forces vie for control of its future and territory?

As complex as Mosul is, Raqqa is more complex. There’s a Raqqa Civilian Council that we’re working with in Ayn Issa, about forty kilometres or so north. The council is a group of Syrians from the area. They’ve already committed to an election in Raqqa no later than next May. The process is well laid out. There are fifty thousand civilians in Raqqa right now, plus about two hundred and fifty thousand displaced people, so the scale is nowhere near Mosul. The long-term settlement of the Syrian civil war is a more distant issue.

Technically, the Assad government can reclaim control of Raqqa?

Connections between Damascus and opposition areas—in terms of paying teachers’ salaries, paying doctors—never completely went away, even in hard-core opposition areas. But people there are going to have some say, and the Syrians I have met in that area do not want the regime to come back before you have a settlement to the over-all civil war. That would breed quite a bit of resistance.

The phase we’re in right now: defeat ISIS ; eliminate the caliphate; and, in parallel, work to de-escalate the over-all civil war through de-escalation areas—the agreement just worked out with Russia in the south, which President Putin and President Trump finalized, it is holding. Two and a half weeks into that ceasefire, fighting has really stopped. So defeat ISIS , de-escalate the over-all civil war, then set the conditions for a realistic discussion of a political settlement.

What about jihadism down the road?

This is not a battle led by the United States. ISIS is a threat to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the U.A.E., to all of our Muslim partners. We have found over the last year a real seriousness to take on this ideological battle.

But by autocratic governments and the countries that gave us the ideology in the first place.

When we started, in 2014, ISIS propaganda outnumbered anti- ISIS propaganda six to one [online]. That ratio’s now reversed. Twitter’s taken off hundreds of thousands of pro- ISIS handles. This is a multifaceted effort not just with governments. It is private sector, it is religious, it is civil society. What law-enforcement people need is information. If we get a phone off the battlefield, or a notebook, or an address book, we are able to vet and verify names, and we have now built a database of nineteen thousand names of known foreign fighters who have tried to join or are affiliated with ISIS [or its sympathizers]. We share that with host nations, and they share it with Interpol.

The nineteen thousand fighters, affiliates, and sympathizers—do we believe they are still alive, or are many of them dead?

http://www.newyorker.com/business/adam-davidson/teddy-roosevelt-wouldnt-understand-the-eus-antitrust-fine-against-google,newyorker,Teddy Roosevelt Would Not Understand the E.U.’s Antitrust Fine Against,[],"Back in 1980, Milton Friedman, the University of Chicago economist, starred in a public-television series called “Free to Choose,” in which he presented his free-market ideas and, famously, told a young man that everything he knew about monopoly power was wrong. In the United States, “monopoly” was synonymous with “evil,” an idea going back to Teddy Roosevelt and the original trustbusters, who saw oil cartels and rail syndicates as enemies run by sneering men with bulbous noses. But Friedman’s surprising assertion was that monopolies were not the result of greedy people amassing and abusing power but, rather, of stupid government rules. “I believe if you examine the sources of monopoly you will find that almost all those sources are government intervention,” Friedman argued. The cure for monopoly, he said, was reducing rules and restrictions, which would inspire market competition and prevent a single company from exclusively holding any corner of commerce.

American antitrust law has followed philosophies ranging from trustbuster to the Chicago School. But both sides of this dispute have something in common: they see monopoly power as dangerous because it limits competition and raises prices, hurting consumers. This emphasis on prices is central to the American antitrust world view. Depending on the ideological leanings of the particular Presidential Administration, the goal of keeping prices down has been pursued by increasing government (the Roosevelt school of thought) or by reducing it (as in Friedman's message).

“Price” is the key word in American antitrust law—higher prices are bad, and lower prices are good. This is because U.S. antitrust laws have, generally, demanded a demonstration that consumers have been harmed by a monopoly and that harm, most often, is defined as higher prices. For the European Commission, whose Google decision was based on antitrust regulations written decades later , after the rise of the Internet, the key word is “innovation.” Monopoly for the Europeans can raise prices, lower prices, or have no impact on prices but still be dangerous because it stifles new ideas. The European Commission has taken a forceful global role in establishing that view, especially under Margrethe Vestager, the current commissioner of competition, who, this week, levied a record $2.7 billion fine against Google for abusing its monopoly power.

The commission said that Google unfairly preferred its own services to those of competitors. According to the Commission, when people searched for certain types of products, Google would place its own Google Shopping search results at the top of the first page and links to other shopping services farther below. In their announcement, the Commission hinted that they may, also, find in favor of several American companies, including Yelp and TripAdvisor, which have long complained that Google puts its own ratings far above those of competitors. In other cases, Google would put, on its own pages, quotes from places like TripAdvisor and Yelp, decreasing the motivation of searchers to go visit those other sites and depriving them of audience and advertising revenue. Google was, essentially, absorbing their entire business model into itself, and taking all of the ad money that went along with it. The company was doing this, in the opinion of the European Union, by abusing its power as the dominant search engine. (Google is even more dominant in Europe than it is in America, if such a thing is imaginable.) Google, of course, rejected these claims, and is considering an appeal.

What is perhaps most striking about the European Union’s decision is that many of the complaints* were from big, U.S.-based firms: not only TripAdvisor and Yelp but also Microsoft, Oracle, and others. They had pursued Google through the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, to no avail. (Government antitrust lawyers found evidence that Google harmed competitors and consumers but chose not to prosecute.) Under the American antitrust model, a monopoly is a company that clearly controls something of value and uses that power, ultimately, to raise prices, thus hurting competition and consumers.

Google’s case shows that the antitrust battle is much more confusing in a digital world. How am I harmed when one service that charges me nothing offers me ratings written (for free) by other users, but doesn’t show me the ratings provided by an entirely different free service? It would be hard to explain to Teddy Roosevelt that someone receiving something for free is being harmed because of a lack of other (free) options. It should be better to have multiple sources of reviews and multiple ways of shopping for products; it should be better for advertisers to have different companies selling ads. But how do we define “better” in these cases? Google is not the sort of obvious enemy that Teddy Roosevelt could point at with his sword and run up a hill to attack. Nor is there a government switch that can be turned off to create a Friedman-esque release from monopoly power.

The European Union defines “antitrust” more broadly than U.S. law does, and thus has more subtle lines of attack. It “prohibits firms that hold a dominant position on a given market to abuse that position, for example by charging unfair prices, by limiting production, or by refusing to innovate to the prejudice of consumers.” The phrase “for example” is doing a lot of work. It is an acknowledgement that government rules and business practices evolve, side by side. Define “antitrust” as raising prices, and businesses will find a way to abuse monopoly power by lowering prices. Regulators in Europe have discretion to evolve alongside the marketplace. Arguably, their discretion is too vast. It has been hard for anybody—government or private sector—to properly predict how future innovation will happen, and how best to support it. However, innovation (and, one might add, data) is clearly as important (if not more important) in this coming century as price. The E.U. laws are, surely, not perfect. But they are closer to the twenty-first century than U.S. laws written at a time of fairly clear oil and railroad monopolies. American law has been stuck in the old continuum between Roosevelt and Friedman. Neither of them is a good guide to this new terrain.

That was, until he adopted a “tiny, tiny” new kitten, Sasuke, named after a cartoon ninja, who vanished from Fukase’s Tokyo apartment ten days after he arrived. “I put up about a hundred ‘Lost Cat’ posters around my neighborhood, but he still didn’t come back,” Fukase wrote. He was living alone again, catless, until, a few weeks later, a woman called him about a stray that “looked just like the cat on the poster.” A meeting was scheduled at the woman’s office. Fukase had been ready to gift her a bottle of good whiskey when he realized that the stray was not Sasuke. “Well, let’s go with this guy anyway,” he thought.

The original Sasuke, 1977. Photograph by Masahisa Fukase

He took the cat in and named him Sasuke Number Two, perhaps hoping that Number Two would be sensitive to the spirit of his predecessor. Fukase doted on his new companion, and a loving relationship followed—one that’s documented in “ Afterword ,” a posthumous collection of Fukase’s photographs of Sasuke Number Two, which is now in its second printing by the Japanese imprint Roshin Books. Fukase is best known for the ominous images of birds published in his 1986 book “Ravens.” The images of Sasuke Number Two, shot during the same period, betray a more playful, joyous eye. Each image seems to discover a new shade of the cat’s colossal personality; no feline gesture is too small to celebrate. Fukase writes, “I wonder if any other photographer in the world has photographed as many cat yawns as I have.”"

http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-texas-tells-us-about-the-latest-threats-to-womens-health-care,newyorker,What Texas Tells Us About the Latest Threats to Women’s Health Care,[],"Among the various chances that congressional Republicans have taken in their effort to repeal and replace Obamacare , one of the riskier moves involves the federal defunding of Planned Parenthood. In both the House and the Senate, replacement legislation has included a provision that would cut off all federal Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood for one year . (The bill would also bar federal tax credits from being used to purchase private health plans that cover abortion.) The provision is reportedly included even in the so-called skinny repeal . The Senate parliamentarian has determined that the provision violates the Byrd rule, which states that a reconciliation bill can only address matters that affect the federal budget; if the anti-Planned Parenthood provision cannot be passed under reconciliation, it would require sixty votes to pass. Many observers expect Senate Republicans to rework the language in the bill so that it can stay in reconciliation. Ted Cruz, meanwhile, has suggested that the parliamentarian’s ruling can be ignored .

That Republicans have taken things this far is a testimony to just how important defunding Planned Parenthood has become to many of them. Planned Parenthood operates more than six hundred clinics across the country, and a majority of its patients have incomes that fall near or below the federal poverty level; the organization receives around forty per cent of its revenue from federal funding, mostly through Medicaid. Cutting off those payments would be a drastic change for women’s health care in this country. For a glimpse of just how drastic it would be, we can look to Texas, where state legislators have been systematically defunding and handicapping Planned Parenthood for years. Currently, the Texas legislature is in special session, and three more anti-abortion measures have already been passed. One of them prevents local and state government agencies from contracting in any way—including via lease agreements—with clinics that are affiliated with abortion providers. As with the federal provision attached to the repeal of Obamacare, Planned Parenthood is not mentioned by name in this Texas bill. And yet, as Texas senators acknowledged last Friday , the bill only affects Planned Parenthood. (Calls to multiple state senators who sponsored the bill were not returned.)

The campaign against Planned Parenthood in Texas kicked off in 2011, a point when, as Lawrence Wright noted recently in the magazine , the organization was serving sixty per cent of the health needs of low-income women in the state. In the 2011 legislative session, which Texas Monthly called “ the most aggressively anti-abortion and anti-contraception session in history ,” the state government cut family-planning spending by two-thirds and approved a budget that, starting in 2013, banned Planned Parenthood from participating in the state’s women’s-health program, now called Healthy Texas Women. Federal law requires that states allow Medicaid patients their choice of “any willing provider,” and so Texas had to give up a nine-to-one federal funding match. Millions of dollars in spending for women’s health care were turned away. Then, this past May, Texas asked the Trump Administration for that federal funding back—a request that, if approved, would signal to other states that Planned Parenthood can be banned from Medicaid family-planning programs at will and with no financial repercussions. According to the New England Journal of Medicine , sixteen additional states have already proposed or approved similar bans.

It’s possible that, even if Planned Parenthood is defunded at the federal level by current Republican efforts, funding might be restored by subsequent legislation. But Texas provides a startling example of how quickly the women’s-health landscape can be wrecked by a withdrawal of resources—and how lasting that wreckage can be. Within months of the family-planning budget getting slashed in Texas, more than sixty women’s-health clinics had closed. Such effects can take years to undo, even if laws are reversed. In 2016, the Supreme Court overturned a Texas law that had halved the number of abortion clinics in the state. Only two clinics have reopened. The sprawl of Texas is almost incomprehensible—it’s the same distance from Houston, my home town, to El Paso as it is from Houston to Kansas City—and that sprawl means that rural clinic closures bring immediate and catastrophic consequences for poor women and women without cars. Teen abortions and teen births have both been increasing in Texas since 2011, and the maternal mortality rate in Texas doubled from 2010 to 2014. It’s now 35.8 deaths per hundred thousand live births—the worst maternal mortality rate you can find in the developed world.

Last week, I spoke to Caroline Coyner-Such, a clinician who has been working in health care for forty-three years, twenty-seven of those at Planned Parenthood. She now works at a clinic in North Austin, one of three in the Austin area that collectively serve nearly nineteen thousand patients each year. “Twenty or thirty years ago,” she told me over the phone, “we saw mainly women under the age of thirty-five. These days, as Texas women lose access to other options, we’re seeing more women, and a wider range of women—preteens up to women in their fifties and sixties.” The previous day, a homeless patient had come in. The North Austin clinic provides well-woman exams, S.T.I. screenings, cervical-cancer screenings, breast-cancer screenings, and birth-control counselling, among other things. It does not provide abortion services, but the surgical center at the South Austin location, thirty minutes away, does.

As clinics in other areas have been forced to close, the Austin-area clinics have begun seeing more and more patients from farther away. “Yesterday, I saw a patient from Elgin, which is an hour away,” Coyner-Such said. “We see people from Killeen, which is another hour away. This means people have to take a whole day off from work to drive to Austin to get basic services—which often used to be available in their communities—and go back. We routinely send prescriptions out in a seventy-five-to-one-hundred-mile radius.” The Austin-area clinics have a base of private donors and local grants that they’ve been able to draw from as they’ve scrambled to replace public funding; small clinics often lack this piecemeal buffer, and rely more heavily on Title X, which is Planned Parenthood’s other federal funding source.

“People are fearful,” Coyner-Such told me. “The summer is usually lower in terms of patient numbers, but not this year.” The news is a constant presence in her workplace, she said, with patients showing up afraid that their insurance will be taken away, and with new regulations from the legislature rolling in. “We have to be constantly monitoring in order to know what we’re going to lose and what we have to recoup,” she said. “It takes a lot of effort to stay on top of—I can’t believe I’m even using this term, but—the fake news.” Patients are sometimes openly surprised that the clinic is clean and professional, or that Coyner-Such has specialty certifications. She knows the kind of campaigning she’s up against. “Years ago, I had a Planned Parenthood bumper sticker, and someone slashed my tires,” she said. “After that, I quit doing bumper stickers—it’s not worth the tire replacement.”

The Republican health-care legislation asks that the landscape of women’s care be reimagined without Planned Parenthood in it. But without Planned Parenthood that landscape, particularly for low-income women, scarcely exists. Pink billboards have gone up around Austin and other major cities in Texas advertising the Healthy Texas Women program, which does not provide abortion services and is explicitly intended to redirect patients from Planned Parenthood, yet sixty thousand fewer women are enrolled in the program than were enrolled in the Medicaid Women’s Health Program in 2011, before Planned Parenthood was excluded. Even setting aside the fact that comprehensive women’s health care necessitates the option of safe abortion—and that the Hyde Amendment has banned federal funding of abortion, with rare exceptions, since 1976—Planned Parenthood serves such a large portion of low-income women, and has done so for so long, that other clinics are logistically incapable of picking up the slack. “There is a real fear, if Texas continues along this line, if they continue to downgrade our funding—where will these women go?” Coyner-Such said. “Will they wait six months for an appointment at another clinic? Or will they be pregnant because they aren’t able to access our services?” Then she excused herself, going back to the patients who awaited her."
http://www.newyorker.com/culture/rabbit-holes/monkey-videos-as-a-way-of-life,newyorker,Monkey Videos as a Way of Life,[],"There’s a stage of child development when a child loses any interest in developing. This manifests in a refusal to eat anything the child doesn’t want to eat. There are workarounds, involving, for instance, dipping food in sugary sauces (because what matters, ultimately, is caloric intake); puréeing or frying everything; distracting the child with screens. Somewhere during this journey, my wife learned from an online discussion group that another family had gotten their child to eat corn by showing the kid a video of a porcupine gnawing on a cob.

I showed it to our son, who was momentarily enthused. (He is easily distracted by screens.) As he played with some vegetables that had been formed and shaped into French fries, I began YouTubing random combinations of animals and food, until I found a video of a monkey carefully picking toppings off a Domino’s pizza . In another video, the same monkey forages through a bag of fries . He holds each one aloft, like a torch in a dark cave; the camera zooms in on the monkey as he peers around the room, chewing his fries in fits and starts. In another video, the monkey twists open a bottle of Vitamin Water and starts drinking it. In yet another, a man presents the monkey with a watermelon . The monkey lunges for a large knife, which the man quickly shields him from; by the end, the monkey is feasting on a large wedge, juice dripping down his face. At this point, I had forgotten about my son altogether. He was watching me as I laughed at a monkey dealing with “ brain freeze ,” and I was wondering how the man in the video, with his crackly, warm laugh, had convinced this monkey, a capuchin named Boo, to trust him.

“We’re gonna set some records with Boo,” Pete Moss, a forty-five-year-old YouTuber from North Carolina, told me recently over the phone. “Have you ever seen someone make a thirty-yard putt with a monkey on their back? Nope. Have you ever seen someone make a half-court shot with a monkey on their back? Nope.” He adopted Boo about nine years ago, he said, at the behest of his son, Ty, who is also a professional YouTuber. (Ty’s videos focus on travel, tech reviews, and skateboarding, with the occasional cameo from Boo.) Their initial intention, he insisted, was not to make videos. But Boo loved goofing off whenever a camera was around, and Moss began uploading videos of him in 2012. Moss already understood YouTube; he has a separate channel where he pranks friends and family members, sometimes using laxatives. And he believed that Boo was special. He talked to his family about devoting himself full time to building the MonkeyBoo YouTube channel. “I got a chance to do this,” he told them. “I don’t want to look back ten years from now and go, ‘What if?’ ”

Moss says the channel’s viewership went up from thirty-five thousand total views after the first year to more than three million a couple of years later. He recently commemorated the page’s three-hundred-thousandth subscriber by feeding Boo sweet-potato puffs . When I called him, he was trying to figure out why a recent video of Boo eating a banana has gotten sixteen million views, many of them in southeast Asia. “The popularity is cool,” he told me, but he said that what makes it worthwhile is the fan mail he receives from people who are going through hard times. “That ranks up there with throwing touchdown passes for a living, or standing onstage playing guitar for fifty thousand people. It’s not the dream you have growing up,” he added. “But the way it makes me feel . . . I can’t put it into words.”

Moss talks about Boo with a mix of affection and awe. After Moss’s favorite football team, the Miami Dolphins, lost an early-season game, a frustrated Boo took off his Dolphins jersey and began wiping the floor with it; shortly thereafter, the Dolphins went on a six-game winning streak. “Boo inspired ’em,” Moss joked. He’s careful about never putting Boo in harm’s way. Although there are videos of the monkey snacking on junk food, he’s actually on a fairly strict diet, Moss said. And, though Moss prefers to keep the monkey out of politics, he did conduct a series of experiments last year in which Boo correctly predicted that a Republican would become President . (It’s possible that Boo simply prefers the color red.)

I asked Moss what the secret is to running a successful YouTube channel. “Consistency,” he said. He’s also always on the hunt for new ideas. When I told him that I found his page while trying to feed my child, he said that he might begin taking online suggestions from parents in similar situations. Maybe Boo can encourage their children to eat, too. Or maybe he’ll shoot a video of Boo looking at this article. They are inseparable—Boo sits next to Moss when he’s editing videos on his computer—and that’s part of what people watching his videos might not understand. “That’s a sad thing. I see new monkey channels pop up all the time,” Moss said. People see Boo’s popularity, but they don’t see how much work it took to build the relationship at the heart of the videos. “The bond that me and Boo have, the way we get along, the love—that is 24/7. Having Boo is not like having a pet, it is a way of life.”"

http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/literary-style-and-the-lessons-of-memoir,newyorker,Literary Style and the Lessons of Memoir,[],"In his book “Memoir: An Introduction,” from 2011, the scholar G. Thomas Couser argues that we go to the genre not so much for detail or style as for “wisdom and self-knowledge,” for what the main character, who is always the author, has learned. Sometimes, though, the style is the lesson. Earlier this year, the Seattle poet Paul Hunter published “Clownery,” which follows Hunter from his birth in the rural Midwest, through college, marriage, fatherhood, divorce, high-school and college teaching, grease- and gear-filled shirtsleeve jobs, caregiving for an ill sister and playing with grandchildren. The chapters conclude with Hunter’s late-life meditations, “trying to keep from a lip-smacking bitterness” as he imagines “the end of the planet as a hospitable home.” Hunter published his first chapbook in 1970, and has been giving us verse about rural and wild America, and practical prose about sustainable farming, every few years since 2000. In “ Clownery ,” rather than using “I” or “me,” or naming any characters, Hunter tells his own story as that of a nameless “clown.”

This simple device has astonishing effects, making Hunter’s life at once more generic—it’s easier to see yourself in “the clown” than in “Paul Hunter”—and funnier and sadder. “One morning out in the country the little clown’s mother was washing her mother’s hair in the kitchen pantry, behind the curtain where they boiled their water and took their washtub baths,” he writes. And later: “The clown knew nothing of planning, and snagged on a nail ripped his pants. Got caught and stayed caught till he was practically naked.” The floppy-shoes aspects of puberty and old age, when we may feel at once too big and too small, too late and too early, fit the conceit almost too easily: “Aging for clowns was more of a ripening that just went on and on. . . . Clowns were born weepy with blubber lips anyhow, and pratfalls demanded lifelong practice,” Hunter writes. “Clowns were always at an awkward stage,” “hiding twitchy flat feet . . . in big shoes.” Sentence by sentence, he manages to sound like a rambling talker, a corn-fed storyteller, even though, each time you finish a page or a chapter, you realize just how elegantly assembled the volume is.

Hunter’s unusual autobiography is one of a few recent books that reinvent, or fracture, the memoir’s form. All come from small presses; all come long after the stylish, formally inventive, and popular books of the late-nineties memoir boom (Dave Eggers’s “ A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius ,” for example, and Lauren Slater’s “ Lying ”). Popular memoirs these days are more direct: it’s generally easy to say what makes the lives they chronicle stand out, so that readers and critics focus on their subjects, whether it’s Appalachia (J. D. Vance’s “ Hillbilly Elegy ”), weight, shame, and trauma (Roxane Gay’s “ Hunger ”), or plant science (Hope Jahren’s nearly perfect “ Lab Girl ”).

Yet experiments in the genre continue, many of them, like Maggie Nelson’s breakthrough book, “ The Argonauts ,” from 2015, intimately connected to the drive toward new forms, and the use of fragments and white space, in contemporary poetry. These memoirs take cues from prose poems and lyrical essays, like those in Claudia Rankine’s “Citizen.” They also use the devices of poetry—interruption, compression, extended metaphor—to pay book-length attention to individual real lives, and, not coincidentally, they come from independent publishers known for their poets and poems.

The writer Jessica Anne told the Chicago Tribune that she began her book “ A Manual for Nothing ” because “I got excited reading unclassifiable books by authors like Maggie Nelson and Lidia Yuknavitch , and I wanted to try it.” She might have fashioned from the material of her life a conventional memoir of family dysfunction and bad sexual decisions. Anne was raised—or not raised—by a mother whose series of boyfriends rivalled, in their unreliability, her series of ailments, including a struggle with terminal cancer that seems to have been imaginary. Anne attended a “Fame”-style performing-arts high school, dropped out of college, discovered feminism, travelled to London, returned to Chicago to make a career as a singer and monologuist, and settled down (with her husband) to write the book.

“A Manual for Nothing” is part collage of half- remembered facts, part tongue-in-cheek guide to womanhood, and part imaginary dialogue, with speaking parts for Shakespeare’s Cleopatra and for Patti LuPone. Its numbered propositions, many of them in the second person, some of them absurd, accrete a willful resistance to realism, even as they frame what seem to be facts from her life. From “Maroon Chart,” a short chapter about menstruation: “Ovulation stains a period’s blood red as a stage curtain. . . . Once the menstrual blood is bright, you become your father’s next of kin.” Elsewhere in the book, Anne imagines telling a boyfriend, “I thought we were forever! I thought you were the pearl onion of my special, special day!” That’s probably not what she said at the time.

The dismemberment of a life into lists—one of the chapters comprises thirty-three short noun phrases—lets Anne frame events that must have terrified her at the time (her mother’s feigned cancer, for example) not as the most important moments in her life but as material to be assimilated, made into something just inches away from a joke. An unwanted sexual experience is “not quite rape, it’s just one of those awkward nights to giggle and gossip over. . . . Everyone’s laughing at you. Don’t cry.” In order to free herself from her past, and to push back against patriarchy’s expectations—so her chopped-up form suggests—she has to generalize, to satirize, to cut her life story into bits that she can crumple or rearrange. Paul Hunter learns equanimity by presenting his life as the life of a circus clown; Jessica Anne learns to imagine control.

The Brooklyn songwriter and poet Jasmine Dreame Wagner, in her own recent memoir, “ On a Clear Day ,” learns to notice particularity—and to get outside her own wish to generalize, to let big theories explain her life. “On a Clear Day” is a capacious book of traveller’s observations, cultural criticism, and quarter-life-crisis notes about deserts, gallery art, and Brooklyn bohemians in our “golden era of listicles.” It’s the kind of book that tries to take the temperature of a generation (Wagner’s first book appeared in 2012) or at least of a generation’s narrow, gallery-going, artsy urban slice. In Wagner’s Brooklyn, “the cacophony of lo-fi indie rock reverb” is also “the sound of gentrification, “the sound of if only ,” “the sound of why me .” Throughout the volume, Wagner puts her name-checked role models (Didion, Deleuze, C. D. Wright, Leslie Jamison) to clever use.

Learning from poets’ sharply quotable lines, and from travel writers’ set pieces and first-person assertions, Wagner has made a book to dip into, open almost at random, or get lost in. In this respect, the book resembles, as she knows, the endless branching paths of social media, which become her subject: “my method of describing the sunset, its noise, is likewise noise. Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr.” Fragmentary prose, composed of disconnected observations and advice, goes back as far as the Bible, but Wagner’s combination of patience and jumpiness, and her search for “the real, presence, materiality” in snippets that keep slipping away from her, seem to fit our age of distraction and hyper-alertness, when we might look up from Proust, or from the Grand Canyon, to see if we’ve been retweeted, or liked, or tagged.

Wagner presents the sublimity of deserts, the welcome alienation of new sites, “the wind’s ripples in the dunes, the dunes’ ripples on the tectonic plate,” almost as a more conventional travelogue would. But her wish to say what she sees works at startling cross-purposes with her critic’s wish to generalize—it is as if she were grasping both for the high-level wisdom that G. Thomas Couser seeks in all memoir and for the ground-level immediacy that Joseph Conrad sought when he said that he wrote fiction “above all, to make you see.” Some gallery artists face the same dilemma: should they focus on visual experience, or on difficult abstract ideas? Sometimes, Wagner manages to follow both Couser and Conrad at once. Her description of winter in the suburbs, for instance, treats the snow as a tangible symbol for—but also as an alternative to—abstraction: “snow blots out the words on the strip mall marquee. It has no part. It speaks of no prior experience . . . . Like chicks swollen in our shells, we must scrape through its opacity to release ourselves.”

That line implies—in harmony with almost all memoirs, but against the grain of some poets—that we still have selves to release. Wagner seems to believe that, but she doesn’t take it for granted: she worries, and who wouldn’t, that the speaking self these days is too like an advertisement, or a means of self-aggrandizement. In her crowded Brooklyn, “in order to secure a voice equal to those of corporations . . . people become brands,” flaunting “the qualities of successful brands, such as media visibility [and] message consistency.” Sell yourself, in other words, or get erased. It’s a grim conclusion for the tradition of memoir, from St. Augustine to our time, and it’s a conclusion that Wagner’s canny fragments, like Anne’s sarcastic lists and Hunter’s tender metaphors, refuse. “The closer I come to my own erasure,” she writes of her time in the Southwestern deserts, “the stronger my work’s urge / to story… If my language is obscure / I’ll vanish in its steam.”"
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/calibris-scandalous-history,newyorker,Calibri’s Scandalous History,[],"Lucas de Groot, a Dutch typeface designer living in Berlin, recently began receiving a flood of calls and e-mails from Pakistan that, he said, “seemed very urgent.” He soon discovered that Calibri, a font he’d designed almost fifteen years earlier, was playing a central role in a corruption scandal engulfing Nawaz Sharif, the Prime Minister of Pakistan. As part of an investigation launched by the country’s Supreme Court, the Prime Minister’s daughter had released a supposedly exculpatory document signed and dated February 2, 2006. The document, however, had been printed in Calibri, which was not widely available until 2007. Investigators deemed the document to have been falsified, and the term “fontgate” began trending on Twitter.

Speaking from his office in Berlin, de Groot said that the incident “has definitely generated the most publicity for Calibri, ever.” He admitted to being a little bit happy about it. “People usually take fonts for granted,” he said.

Calibri was born in 2004, when a fellow typeface designer recruited de Groot to work on a project for “a secret client.” The client wanted a modern font that was optimized for screen reading. De Groot revised a font he’d developed seven years earlier, paying special attention to “the rhythm of the letter widths” and “the speed of the curvature.” The client turned out to be Microsoft, which, to de Groot’s astonishment, chose Calibri as the default font for its Microsoft Office suite. His payment for the font covered some office renovations, but not much else. “I am not a very good businessman,” he said.

Since 2007, Calibri has figured in several other forgery allegations. In 2012, the Turkish government accused approximately three hundred people of plotting a coup, on the basis of documents that had been printed in Calibri but were purported to date from as early as 2003. De Groot sent a form letter in response to the many inquiries he received from Pakistan. “In my opinion, the document in question was produced much later” than 2006, he wrote. While Microsoft had by then released a beta version of its Office suite that included Calibri, de Groot pointed out that only “computer nerds” and “font lovers” were using it. “Why would anyone use a completely unknown font for an official document?”

By coincidence, the font also figures in America’s ongoing Presidential scandal. One day before fontgate, Donald Trump, Jr., took to Twitter to release the e-mails he wrote while setting up a meeting between members of the Trump campaign and Russians offering dirt on Hillary Clinton. He included a short introductory note—“in order to be totally transparent, I am releasing the entire email chain of my emails”—typed in Calibri.

While most Trump critics focussed on the contents of the e-mail chain, a few zeroed in on Donald, Jr.,’s font choice. A writer for Elle ’ s Web site called Calibri “fine for a grocery list; a less ideal choice for what’s supposed to be a considered response.” One Twitter user said, “The part that angers me most is his use of Calibri font, which I hate #sad #loweffort.”

De Groot is “not a big fan” of the Trump Administration, but he defended Donald, Jr.,’s choice of Calibri, explaining that the President’s son may have been trying to tap into the font’s relatability. “Calibri is a font that everybody recognizes—a normal font,” he said. “Everybody who reads his note will realize, ‘Hey, this is the font that I’m using.’ It comes off genuine.”

De Groot dismissed the critics who attack Calibri as boring, arguing that its “neutrality” belies its underlying precision: “If you’re eating soup, you shouldn’t remember the shape of the spoon.” He listed Calibri’s virtues: it doesn’t try to mimic what already exists (“Courier is an ugly old typewriter font”); it’s stripped of old-fashioned serif embellishments (“Compared to Calibri, Times New Roman looks outdated”); and it’s playful, with its rounded corners, but not frivolous (“Comic Sans doesn’t work”).

A Pakistani journalist recently tweeted that if Prime Minister Sharif is forced out of office he should write his resignation letter using Calibri. If the Russia investigation forces Trump to resign, should the U.S. President do the same? De Groot considered. “I don’t think Calibri fits with the voice of Donald Trump, not at all,” he said. “He’s speaking so poorly, a very bold kind of speech. A resignation letter by Trump should be in black capitals—loud. You need Franklin Gothic extra bold, I think.” ♦"
http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/one-mans-two-year-quest-not-to-finish-final-fantasy-vii,newyorker,One Man’s Two-Year Quest Not to Finish Final Fantasy VII,[],"In 2012, David Curry, a thirty-four-year-old cashier from Southern California, came across a post on an online forum by someone who went by the handle Dick Tree. It contained a herculean proposal: Tree planned to play the 1997 video game Final Fantasy VII for as many hours as it took to raise the characters to their maximum potential, without ever leaving the opening scene, which unfolds in a nuclear reactor. Final Fantasy VII is a role-playing game, a form popularized in the nineteen-seventies by Dungeons & Dragons, in which players’ feats—beasts felled, maidens wooed—are quantified with “experience points.” Accrue enough of these points, and your character ascends a level, at which point it confronts stronger opponents worth more points. Curry estimated that, even playing for a few hours every day, Tree’s attempt to raise a character to Level 99 by fighting only the game’s weakest enemies would take more than a year to complete.

Nevertheless, Tree attracted a following of forum users, including Curry, who cheered the project on and watched it unfold in sporadic posts. Over time, Curry told me recently, Tree’s updates became more infrequent. After two years, Tree stopped altogether. “I got fed up with Dick Tree,” he said. “So I declared that I would do it myself.”

Curry had first played Final Fantasy VII several years after its début, but had set the game down after a few hours, underwhelmed. Although he had participated in a few Web endurance projects—he once provided commentary on twenty-three seasons’ worth of “The Simpsons”—he had never undertaken a video-game marathon before. “I don’t consider myself anything more than a casual gamer,” Curry said. But then, on January 18, 2015, he switched on his PlayStation and loaded the game disk. “After that first session, I felt confident that I could complete the challenge,” he told me. “I was also confident that I would teach Dick Tree a lesson about finishing what you start.”

Sometimes Curry played every day, and sometimes he went weeks without picking up the controller. Sessions might last one hour or twenty-four. As time passed, the forum users rallied behind him. At one point, Tree reappeared, claiming to have, in fact, completed the challenge already, without telling the group. “He couldn’t back up his claim with any sort of evidence, so we went on in spite of him,” Curry said.

A few months into his endeavor, Curry bought some hardware that allowed him to record his activity. He started uploading the footage to YouTube, then broadcasting it live on the streaming service Twitch . In April, a full two years after he had embarked on the project, his characters reached Level 98. “When the final session first started, mostly what I felt was pain,” Curry recalled. He had recently undergone surgery on his arm, which was still heavily bandaged and resting in a sling. Using his free hand, Curry began the fifty-six-minute session that would take him past the finish line. “It didn’t take very long for the Twitch chat to fill up with far more people than usual,” he said. “Before the finale, I would struggle to keep five viewers, but that day I had around fifty. Just keeping up with reading and responding to comments took most of my attention.” When the moment came, Curry met it with an appropriate sense of ceremony. “I’m going to hit the button and we’re going to get that glorious half a second where it says ‘Level up,’ ” he says in the video , his voice quivering. “I want us to savor that level-up, because it is the last one . . . Brace yourselves.”

The human predilection for combining tenacity and tedium goes back a long way; in the early twentieth century, for instance, there was a fad for pole-sitting, in which practitioners would sit atop flagpoles, often for days at a time, winking at crowds. Video games offer a new avenue for the old impulse. Indeed, Curry is one of many players to engage in arcane endurance challenges. Every year for the past decade, an Internet sketch-comedy troupe called LoadingReadyRun has driven a virtual bus from Tucson, Arizona, to Las Vegas, Nevada, in Desert Bus , an unreleased video game from 1995 conceived by the American entertainers Penn Jillette and Teller. Tens of thousands of people tune in to watch the troupe’s progress through the mind-numbing, unpausable game, and their donations have, to date, raised more than $3.8 million for a children’s charity. Another man, Kurt J. Mac, is several years into a two-decade-long quest to walk to the edge of the Minecraft universe . Efforts like this redefine the traditional parameters of success in video games, which typically reward quickness and dexterity. “Not everyone can set the world record in Donkey Kong,” Curry said. “But all it takes to walk to the edge of the Minecraft map or reach Level 99 in the first reactor in Final Fantasy VII is time.”

Many have poured scorn on Curry’s venture, particularly since it doesn’t have a charitable component. “This is the most pathetic waste of man hours that could have been used for good that I’ve seen in a long time,” one typical YouTube comment says. On the forum where he first heard about Dick Tree’s idea, Curry posted a spirited, if nihilistic, rebuttal. “To say that our lives are pointless and our achievements meaningless is to state the obvious,” he wrote. “No matter how grand our achievements or how broad their scope, time turns all to dust and death destroys all memory. But that does not mean we cannot ascribe our own meaning to what we do.” For Curry, the Final Fantasy VII challenge proved not only comforting but also instructive. “It taught me perseverance, of course,” he said. “But more important than the ability to finish what you start is what I now see as the moral goodness of finishing what you start.”

Curry has already moved on to another endurance challenge, set in the preceding game in the series, Final Fantasy VI. But he may not be done with VII’s opening scene just yet; the game is currently being remade in Japan, at vast expense, and the new version is expected to come out in the next few years. “I’m already thinking about doing it again,” he told me."
http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson-sorkin/scaramucci-is-in-priebus-is-out,newyorker,Scaramucci Is In. Priebus Is Out,[],"It makes some sense that, after Anthony Scaramucci, the President’s incoming communications director, told The New Yorker’s Ryan Lizza that he was setting the F.B.I. on Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, the two men couldn’t work together any longer. But it bespeaks the peculiar logic of the Trump White House that it was Priebus, and not Scaramucci, who had to go. There wasn’t even a pretense of chastising the new man. Scaramucci had, in his screed to Lizza , said that he would “get to” whoever had leaked information about him, adding, “Reince Priebus—if you want to leak something—he’ll be asked to resign very shortly.” The President proved Scaramucci right less than a day later; Priebus was out late Friday afternoon. This doesn’t make Scaramucci a prophet, or even a model for how to handle the President. There have been plenty of theories about how to do that—cajole, reason, beg, flatter, remind him that he’s your father—and none have proved entirely successful. Scaramucci is just a guy who knew that someone was being picked on, and jumped in. Now the rest of us can sit back and see how long it takes for someone to pick on Scaramucci.

Trump, while leaving an event for law-enforcement officers on Long Island, said that Priebus was “a good man,” but that the person he had chosen to replace him, retired Marine General John Kelly, the Secretary of Homeland Security, was “a star.” There had been reports in recent days that Trump wanted a general to manage his office; generals appeal to him, perhaps because he believes, accurately or not, that they are tough individuals who nonetheless will follow orders—his orders, that is—or maybe just because he likes uniforms. The way that Trump seems to imagine the character of people in uniform—whether the military, the police, or the Boy Scouts —is in many ways itself an insult to those who wear one, and among the ways that he continues to damage the political culture. (Before the Priebus announcement, Charlie Savage, of the Times , tweeted that the President’s Long Island speech would be remembered for this line about the police: “When you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon—you just see them thrown in, rough—I said, please don’t be too nice.”) In this case, Trump may also have been charmed by Kelly’s enthusiasm for the President’s immigration agenda; Barbara Starr, of CNN, who has covered the Pentagon for years, said that her sources told her that, with regard to Trump, Kelly had become something of a true believer. Then again, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has been the truest believer of all, and he has been derided by the President as not only weak but “ VERY weak.”

Priebus was supposed to be a link to the institutional G.O.P., and thus a stabilizing presence. The problem with this logic is that, as the health-care debate has shown, the Republican Party itself is, at the moment, highly unstable; it has its own bouts of irrationality, tantrums, and extremes, independent of Trump. That doesn’t mean that Priebus’s departure won’t bring about changes; it just makes their nature harder to predict. What is Trump going to ask Kelly to do, and whom will he ask him to fire? And what kind of reward does Scaramucci get now from those cowed into deferring to him rather than leaving the Administration? It’s not really Scaramucci’s temper and crudity that anyone has to fear, though; it’s Trump’s. The President will look for someone else to ratify his anger if he gets tired of the current team. One might ask to what end all the yelling and firing is directed—where is the part where America is made great again? But, in the Trump White House, bullying is its own reward."
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/06/05/the-work-you-do-the-person-you-are,newyorker,"The Work You Do, the Person You Are",[],"All I had to do for the two dollars was clean Her house for a few hours after school. It was a beautiful house, too, with a plastic-covered sofa and chairs, wall-to-wall blue-and-white carpeting, a white enamel stove, a washing machine and a dryer—things that were common in Her neighborhood, absent in mine. In the middle of the war, She had butter, sugar, steaks, and seam-up-the-back stockings.

I knew how to scrub floors on my knees and how to wash clothes in our zinc tub, but I had never seen a Hoover vacuum cleaner or an iron that wasn’t heated by fire.

Part of my pride in working for Her was earning money I could squander: on movies, candy, paddleballs, jacks, ice-cream cones. But a larger part of my pride was based on the fact that I gave half my wages to my mother, which meant that some of my earnings were used for real things—an insurance-policy payment or what was owed to the milkman or the iceman. The pleasure of being necessary to my parents was profound. I was not like the children in folktales: burdensome mouths to feed, nuisances to be corrected, problems so severe that they were abandoned to the forest. I had a status that doing routine chores in my house did not provide—and it earned me a slow smile, an approving nod from an adult. Confirmations that I was adultlike, not childlike.

In those days, the forties, children were not just loved or liked; they were needed. They could earn money; they could care for children younger than themselves; they could work the farm, take care of the herd, run errands, and much more. I suspect that children aren’t needed in that way now. They are loved, doted on, protected, and helped. Fine, and yet . . .

Little by little, I got better at cleaning Her house—good enough to be given more to do, much more. I was ordered to carry bookcases upstairs and, once, to move a piano from one side of a room to the other. I fell carrying the bookcases. And after pushing the piano my arms and legs hurt so badly. I wanted to refuse, or at least to complain, but I was afraid She would fire me, and I would lose the freedom the dollar gave me, as well as the standing I had at home—although both were slowly being eroded. She began to offer me her clothes, for a price. Impressed by these worn things, which looked simply gorgeous to a little girl who had only two dresses to wear to school, I bought a few. Until my mother asked me if I really wanted to work for castoffs. So I learned to say “No, thank you” to a faded sweater offered for a quarter of a week’s pay.

Still, I had trouble summoning the courage to discuss or object to the increasing demands She made. And I knew that if I told my mother how unhappy I was she would tell me to quit. Then one day, alone in the kitchen with my father, I let drop a few whines about the job. I gave him details, examples of what troubled me, yet although he listened intently, I saw no sympathy in his eyes. No “Oh, you poor little thing.” Perhaps he understood that what I wanted was a solution to the job, not an escape from it. In any case, he put down his cup of coffee and said, “Listen. You don’t live there. You live here. With your people. Go to work. Get your money. And come on home.”

That was what he said. This was what I heard:

Whatever the work is, do it well—not for the boss but for yourself. You make the job; it doesn’t make you. Your real life is with us, your family. You are not the work you do; you are the person you are.

I have worked for all sorts of people since then, geniuses and morons, quick-witted and dull, bighearted and narrow. I’ve had many kinds of jobs, but since that conversation with my father I have never considered the level of labor to be the measure of myself, and I have never placed the security of a job above the value of home. ♦

The six-minute film, called “14th Arrondissement,” set in that part of Paris (which includes much of Montparnasse), stars Margo Martindale as an American tourist who visits some of its notable and less notable sites. To say much more is to spoil the comedic—and the cosmic—delight, but there’s a line from Donald Barthelme’s story “The King of Jazz” that cites a performance’s “real epiphanic glow,” and that’s what Payne and Martindale achieve together. (Also, note Payne’s use and non-use of music, and of the prime Hitchcockian device: the point-of-view shot.) It’s six minutes; it’s a world. (The other films in the collection range from pretty good to why bother. Payne’s film is at 1:43:38.)

This Sunday, Film Forum launches a brief but significant retrospective of films by Lois Weber, a contemporary of D. W. Griffith, and her directorial career, ranging from 1911 to 1934, had roughly the same span. Her short film “ Suspense ” (YouTube), from 1913, delivers on the promise of its title, and does so with a visual and narrative inventiveness that would do a twenty-first-century filmmaker proud. It’s the story of a young woman at home with her infant child who becomes aware of an intruder. (The image where he peeps at the window behind her made me literally jump.) Weber was a primordial master of point-of-view shots, which she deploys among other highly inflected angles to infuse the action with psychological torment. To film the technology of the telephone, Weber finds a sharp new technique, and there’s even a chase scene on the open road that, in its climactic moment, may never have been bettered. There’s also a strange social element to the drama—what may, at one angle, appear as class prejudice may also appear, at another, as a view of the derangements wrought by poverty. The feature by Weber that Film Forum is showing this Sunday, “ The Blot ,” from 1921, is centered on that very theme.

The Borscht Corporation , a Miami-based independent-film group—it sometimes finances, sometimes shows, and generally catalyzes the work of filmmakers—was crucial to the making of Barry Jenkins’s “Moonlight.” A more first-hand Borscht production, Terence Nance’s “ Swimming in Your Skin Again ” (Vimeo), from 2015, similarly captures the emotional climate and landscape of Miami but by means of music, choreography, metaphor, and with Nance’s own distinctive mix of animation and effects with live action. It brings together religion and mysticism, daily practicalities and cultural memory, spiritual aspirations and erotic obsession—and even, in exquisite allusions, young people’s coming of age and the confrontation with adult responsibilities. (It also has the beach and the ocean, ecstatically.) Nance, one of the most prodigiously talented contemporary American filmmakers, hasn’t made a feature since his first, “An Oversimplification of Her Beauty,” from 2012; in the meantime, his short films have been among the jewels of the recent cinema (such as “ Univitellin ,” one of the best films at last year’s New York Film Festival).

The Danish director Carl Theodor Dreyer is on the shortlist of the greatest directors ever; he made a batch of silent films (the most celebrated, and by far the most original of the ones that I’ve seen, is “The Passion of Joan of Arc”) but only a handful of talking pictures—the last of which, “Gertrud,” from 1964, might fairly be called the most profound and exalted love story ever filmed. O.K., but he made a high-speed action film, too? “ They Caught the Ferry ” (YouTube), from 1948, is a classic in a rather unusual genre: the highway-safety film. The story is simple: a man driving a motorcycle and the woman who is his passenger have forty-five minutes to go about seventy kilometres (about forty-three miles) in order to catch a ferry. Dreyer’s way with the details and sensations of the open (and sometimes not-so-open) road is proof of the convergence of style with substance; he doesn’t just depict speed—he reveals it. But his motion is also a matter of metaphysics: the movie is a classic in yet another genre, the two-roads-diverged story, and its twist pivots on a face that’s a masterstroke of casting and that launches this brisk, didactic film into the realm of horror classics.

For Agnès Varda, the blend of fiction and documentary has always been crucial and conspicuous, as in her 1967 documentary “ Uncle Yanco ” (the Criterion Channel on FilmStruck)—a personal story about her first meeting, in Sausalito, with her artist cousin Jean (Yanco) Varda, who lived there on a houseboat in what he calls “aquatic suburbia.” The playful yet vast movie is a sort of family portrait in which Jean discusses his life, his family, and his times—and in which the family reunion is openly, cleverly reconstructed, with multiple takes and an element of sentimental fantasy. The filmmaker’s ardent, good-humored portrait of her relative and her plunge into family history is also the portrait of an artist, a man of the world and of the era. Filming in October, 1967, she unfolds, through Jean’s observations, the radical political ferment of the period—in particular, in nearby San Francisco—and his prescient sense of mighty changes looming because of the generation in revolt. The whimsical profundity of Jean’s reflections on his improvisational paintings suggests a close family resemblance with Agnès Varda and her films. “It’s an adventure, an exploration,” he writes. “You discover yourself.”"

The black poet would love to say his century began

With Hughes or, God forbid, Wheatley, but actually

http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/middlemarch-gets-winningly-adapted-as-a-web-series,newyorker,“Middlemarch” Gets Winningly Adapted as a Web Series,[],"“Middlemarch,” by George Eliot, has largely been immune to the kind of contemporary adaptation visited upon the works of other nineteenth-century writers. The novelist Kay Woodward has turned Charlotte Brontë’s “Jane Eyre” into a chapter book for tweens called “Jane Airhead,” and Jane Austen’s works have been endlessly updated, from “Bridget Jones’s Diary” to “The Lizzie Bennet Diaries,” a Web series that won an Emmy, four years ago, for translating Austen’s novel into the form of a vlog.

But why never “ Middlemarch ”? Why has the novel proved largely resistant to such reimagining? There is, to be sure, a history of accomplished novelists slipping references to Eliot’s masterwork into their own fictions, using a character’s relation to the novel as an indicator of his or her moral development, while also offering a sly allusion to the literary company that the novelist in question wishes to keep. In Edith Wharton’s “The Age of Innocence,” Newland Archer receives a box of books sent from England, including “a novel called ‘Middlemarch,’ as to which there had lately been interesting things said in the reviews.” (He tries to read it but finds himself distracted from the story of English provincial life by wondering about the cosmopolitan background of the Countess Olenska.) In “To the Lighthouse,” Virginia Woolf uses Eliot’s novel to convey the social and intellectual anxiety experienced by Minta Doyle, one of the Ramsays’ houseguests, who is afraid of Mr. Ramsay’s literary dinner-table conversation, “for she had left the third volume of ‘Middlemarch’ in the train and she never knew what happened in the end.” (Ultimately, she resolves her social awkwardness by pretending to be “even more ignorant than she was, because he liked telling her she was a fool.”)

More recently, Adelle Waldman joined this honorable tradition with “ The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P. ” Her characters, gathered at a housewarming party, discuss the fate of Eliot’s Tertius Lydgate, the ambitious doctor whose professional aspirations are ruined by his misguided choice in marriage. Eliot was “not exactly unbiased,” one character observes. “Smart women have a personal stake in vilifying men who fail to appreciate smart women.” Eliot’s themes—the difficulties of communication within and without marriage; the limitations placed on women’s accomplishments and expectations by restrictive social structures; the gradual substitution of resignation in the place of aspiration—have proved enduringly inspiring to generations of writers, as well as readers. But the density of the novel’s structure, and its psychological complexity, seem to have rendered it too daunting for “Clueless”-like efforts at a wholesale relocation to a new context.

Which means that one ongoing attempt to do so is worth watching, for its ambition as well as for its charm. “Middlemarch: The Series,” written and directed by Rebecca Shoptaw, an undergraduate in the film department at Yale, is a Web serial that will run, ultimately, to seventy episodes. So far, the first half is available online ; the series will start up again in August. Shoptaw has recast Eliot’s residents of the provincial town of Middlemarch as students at Lowick College, in the fictional town of Middlemarch, Connecticut. Dorothea Brooke, Eliot’s heroine, is now Dot Brooke, an idealistic, thoughtful sophomore, played by a Yale undergrad named Mia Fowler, who has a beguiling vulnerability and intelligence on camera. Dot has yet to figure out her major, and has decided to film herself and her friends for a year, just to see what she can make of the results. “I feel like if we can watch and understand where we are now, it will help us figure out what we want to do later,” she says in the first episode. “And, it’s like, half the time we just sit and wait for things to happen.” The series, which largely consists of Dot and her friends speaking directly to the camera, is filmed in settings intended to suggest a variety of dorm rooms, as well as in the kitchen of a pizza parlor known as Stone Court (which is, actually, a pretty good name for a pizza parlor).

In her previous work, available on her YouTube channel, Shoptaw has mined classic literature for L.G.B.T.Q. themes. In one video , she has taken Shakespeare’s Sonnet 23, which begins, “As an unperfect actor on the stage / Who with his fear is put beside his part,” and turned it into a gay love story just short of four minutes long. Her most notable innovation with “Middlemarch: The Series” is gender-bending the cast, envisioning a social group in which gender identity and sexual orientation are variable and possibly mutable. Sir James Chettam, Dorothea Brooke’s first suitor, is, in Eliot’s novel, the picture of conservative conformity. In Shoptaw’s reimagining, Chettam becomes Jamie, a meek scientist who wears a knit beanie and a buttoned-up shirt and hides behind a pair of owlish spectacles, and whose preferred gender pronoun is “they.” (Jamie is played by Lola Hourihane, whose cast bio reveals, “They previously played a wall in ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream,’ a performance which brought their grandmother to tears (of shame).”) Mary Garth, the quiet, diligent young woman whom many readers have seen as the alternative heroine of Eliot’s story, has been turned into Max Garth, a gay townie who resembles Mary in his humility and intelligence, if not in his appearance. Mary Garth, whom Eliot describes as “brown,” has “a broad face and square brow, well-marked eyebrows and curly dark hair,” characteristics that, in the world of Eliot’s “Middlemarch,” amount to plain and ordinary. Kai Nugent, the African-American actor who plays Max, also has a broad face, square brow, well-marked eyebrows, and curly dark hair, but on him these features read as strikingly handsome.

In an interview with the Web site Fandomania, Shoptaw said that she was able to imagine “Middlemarch” through this L.G.B.T.Q. lens because, unlike other Victorian novels she had read, its “healthier relationships are almost entirely free of the gendered power dynamics that too often shape the relationships in classic novels.” Shoptaw has distinguished company in questioning the gendered characterizations of figures in “Middlemarch.” Henry James, who was alert to such issues, wondered in particular about the masculinity of Will Ladislaw, with whom Dorothea falls in love. James found Ladislaw unconvincing: “vague and impalpable . . . a woman’s man.” In Shoptaw’s reworking, Ladislaw becomes Billie, played by a female actor who goes by the name C. B. G., and it will be interesting to see, as the series progresses, how faithfully Shoptaw renders the ultimate subsuming of Dorothea’s ambitions and identity into those of Ladislaw—a fictional conclusion that many feminist readers, from the eighteen-seventies until today, have considered a capitulation on the part of Eliot.

But one might also take issue with Shoptaw’s suggestion that the novel’s “healthier relationships” are where the story’s principal focus lies. It is true that the relationship between Mary Garth and Fred Vincy—perhaps the healthiest in the book—could be seen as a model of gender equity, or at least parity. But Eliot’s greatest accomplishment in “Middlemarch” is to anatomize bad relationships—to show, with excruciating psychological penetration, the ways in which individuals fail to recognize one another, becoming disappointed and embittered by a partner’s failure to measure up to fantasy. If the marriages between Dorothea and Edward Casaubon, her pedantic scholar husband, and Lydgate and Rosamond Vincy, the stubbornly conventional town beauty, were healthier, they would be a lot less compelling to read about.

On the evidence of the episodes released so far, Shoptaw has been faithful to Eliot’s slow-moving world of Middlemarch, while also taking some necessary liberties with the complexity of the novel. With a cast of only ten, some of the functions of Eliot’s minor characters have been subsumed into her major ones. Bulstrode, Middlemarch’s pious, overweening banker, has remained offscreen; he is the funder of an internship that Fred Vincy—played with boyish gusto by Oliver Shoulson—assumes he’s going to win, and doesn’t. It’s too early to know for sure, but it seems likely that Shoptaw has eliminated one major strand that Eliot developed in “Middlemarch”: Bulstrode’s rise and his shaming fall, which is crucial in contributing to the novel’s monumental gravity. And thus far, at least, Shoptaw’s Lydgate is an arrogant chump, whose confident aspirations are played for comedy—“What does that bracelet mean? Or is it just a hair scrunchie?” he asks Rosamond—rather than reaching the dimension of tragedy, which is the light in which Eliot saw his struggle and his renunciation. Shoptaw is on surer ground with the character of Rosamond, who is convinced that her flirtation with Lydgate is an I.R.L. rom-com—a fitting update of Eliot’s suggestion that Rosamond has gathered all her ideas about love from second-rate novels.

Still, it’s an impossibly tall order to expect a Web series to approach the nuance of a nineteenth-century novel—of the nineteenth-century novel. And there are moments in which Shoptaw’s chosen medium offers useful narrative devices that weren’t available to Eliot. Casaubon’s explanation of his unbearably dull research dissertation—“Being and World: Transcendental Otherness and Identity”—is given as a sequence of short cuts, thus rendered even more incomprehensible. (In Shoptaw’s retelling, Casaubon, Dorothea’s much older scholar husband, is a grad student. Presumably to cast him as a professor would have violated Lowick College’s consensual-relations code, which, if it is anything like Yale’s, forbids any sexual or amorous relationship between teachers and undergrads.) And Shoptaw’s use of the video camera as an opportunity for intimate confessional is a clever substitute for Eliot’s narrative technique of describing the inner life of her characters, and showing the ways in which their understanding of themselves and others is circumscribed by their restricted points of view.

There is also a winning affection for the nineteenth-century novel in Shoptaw’s project: she clearly loves “Middlemarch,” and feels enriched by having read it. And for non-college-aged viewers, the series serves as a poignant representation of undergrad life as, apparently, it is lived now. In “ Rain Check ,” the best episode of the series so far, Dot and Billie find themselves alone on a rainy afternoon in Casaubon’s apartment, with a couple of cameras at hand. They film themselves goofing about—drawing cartoonish pictures of each other, and taking an online quiz to find out which Hogwarts house each would belong to. Deliberately or not, Shoptaw reminds her viewers that, for her generation—indeed, for everyone under the age of thirty-five—reading the Harry Potter books is far more likely to constitute their most formative literary experience than is reading “Middlemarch,” or any other Victorian novel, for that matter.

In the episode, Dot and Billie lie on the rug together—a reference to Eliot’s preferred metaphor for Ladislaw’s bohemianism, which is indicated by his predilection for lying around on his friends’ carpets. (In Eliot’s novel, Dorothea doesn’t get to do it with him.) Flat on the floor, with the camera looking down on them, they exchange what they understand to be the meaning of life. “To flourish and help others flourish,” Billie offers, with quiet certitude. Dot is more provisional. “I really don’t know,” she says. “Maybe you’re supposed to figure it out. Like, the meaning of life is to continuously try to find the meaning of life.” It’s a lovely moment, conveying a spirit of youth and uncertainty—the same spirit that George Eliot sought to bring to the page almost a hundred and fifty years ago. In it, Shoptaw captures what remains constant about the restless inquiries of young people who want their lives to be meaningful, no matter what has changed about the world they may find themselves in the middle of."

http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/donald-trumps-state-of-mind-and-ours,newyorker,"Donald Trump’s State of Mind, and Ours",[],"The latest victims of a “hot mike,” that miraculous conduit of political candor, are Senator Susan Collins, the Republican from Maine, and her colleague Jack Reed, the Rhode Island Democrat. During a lull in an Appropriations subcommittee meeting on Tuesday, Collins and Reed kibbitzed about the President’s state of mind, including his evident confusion about basic legislative procedure.

“I think he’s crazy,” Reed said, in a low voice.

“I’m worried,” Collins replied.

“I don’t say that lightly, as kind of, you know, ‘a goofy guy,’ ” Reed went on. “The, uh, this thing, you know, if we don’t get a budget deal—”

“I know,” Collins said.

“We’re going to be paralyzed, D.O.D.”— the Department of Defense— “everything is going to be paralyzed.”

Collins ventured that the President appears unfamiliar with the spending cap, passed in 2011, called the Budget Control Act. “I don’t even think he knows that there is a B.C.A,” she said.

When the audio of this exchange emerged, Collins’s office elaborated, to the Washington Post , that she is “worried” about “the elimination of transportation and housing programs in the President’s budget request.” A spokesman for Reed offered no apology, saying, “The Trump Administration is behaving erratically and irresponsibly.”

When Donald Trump was a candidate, his admirers explained his obsessions and his aggressions—about Megyn Kelly, Rosie O’Donnell, Hillary Clinton—as the excesses of a fierce competitor. When Trump was new to the White House, his friends defended his false claims—about “illegal votes,” the size of his Inauguration crowd, and the “highest” murder rate in decades—as bruised feelings from a tough campaign and settling pains in an unfamiliar environment.

But as Trump passed the six-month mark in office, facing historic unpopularity and a raft of investigations involving his campaign and his family, his comments and his political behavior have become only more bizarre, as if driven by the centrifugal force of his instincts. Among his recent fantasies, he asserted that the investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 election, headed by the special counsel Robert Mueller, was “not an investigation”; he ventured that Medicaid funding “actually goes up” under a Senate bill that would have cut it sharply; and he said that he had signed more bills “than any President, ever,” ignoring Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Harry Truman, and F.D.R., all of whom, the Times noted, had signed more at this point in their terms. And finally, this week, Trump seemed to mistake a visit to a crowd of children and teen-agers for a political rally, reminiscing with an audience of Boy Scouts about an election-night event that probably happened past their bedtime: “Do you remember that incredible night with the maps, and the Republicans are red and the Democrats are blue, and that map was so red, it was unbelievable, and they didn’t know what to say?”

None of that was likely as disconcerting to Trump’s political allies, however, as his sudden, public turn against some of his most obedient servants. His primary target was Jeff Sessions , the campaign loyalist and Attorney General, whom he mocked and taunted for recusing himself from the Russia probe and opening the way for Mueller’s investigation. (Never mind that Sessions was ethically bound to recuse himself.) Trump has also shown signs of turning against his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, as he did with Sean Spicer, his former press secretary .

As a result of all this, the President’s behavior has inspired a renewed debate among mental-health professionals. For months, some psychologists and others have bridled against an ethical restriction that bars them from publicly opining on the mental health of Trump, or of any public figure whom they have not personally examined. After considering the matter, the American Psychiatric Association redoubled its commitment to the restriction, known as the Goldwater Rule, because psychiatrists, in 1964, had described the Presidential candidate Barry Goldwater as disturbed and he sued, successfully, for libel. This winter, the American Psychiatric Association expanded the rule to cover not only attempts at public diagnoses but also “professional opinions” about public figures.

But this month, another professional association made clear that it takes a different stance. In a memo on July 6th, the American Psychoanalytic Association said that members are “free to comment about political figures as individuals.” The group said that it “does not consider political commentary by its individual members an ethical matter.”

Lance Dodes, a retired assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, told me, “For those of us who have been fighting for just such a public statement, this is wonderful news.” He went on, “There is no patient, therefore no issue of confidentiality, privacy, or consent. And, as with oncologists commenting on John McCain’s cancer, there is no ethical need to have examined a person to have a medical opinion.”

For some mental-health practitioners, the ethical debate is a distraction from a larger point. In a forthcoming book called “ Twilight of American Sanity ,” Allen Frances, a professor emeritus at Duke University Medical College, argues that the more urgent concern is unravelling the national psyche that brought our politics to this moment. Frances told me, “We need to be looking in the mirror to see what’s wrong with us that would allow someone who is so unsuitable for the Presidency to rise to the highest and most dangerous office in the world. Trump’s psychology is far too obvious to be interesting. You don’t have to be a psychoanalyst to understand Trump. He’s the most transparent human being who ever lived. Giving it a name doesn’t explain it or change it.”

As Trump rages in the White House, the country has settled into a summer numbness. The protests have grown less frequent; the country has escaped to the beach; the latest cell-phone push notifications from news apps no longer produce a skip of the heart. Diagnosing that sense of permission and paralysis is an urgent problem, Frances said. “The instruments for dealing with Trump are political,” he added. “Psychological name-calling is an impotent avoidance of our responsibility as citizens, and it represents a failure to try to get insight into us, which is much more important.”"

But his crackdown has torn some families apart. Illustration by Rachel Levit

On June 28th, President Trump convened a roundtable at the White House that included victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. The event was part of the Administration’s push to pass several new immigration bills designed to, in Trump’s words, “close the dangerous loopholes exploited by criminals, gang members, drug dealers, killers, terrorists.” A regular theme of the Trump Administration’s messaging on immigration has been to present undocumented “bad hombres” as an immediate threat to the safety and cohesion of the American family unit. But some of Trump’s immigration policies, in themselves, have endangered families across America. The stories below, of four mothers who have been targeted for deportation since January, show how. As the director of the Global Migration Project, at Columbia Journalism School, I spent the spring supervising a team of twelve journalists who sought to understand the evolution of Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) under President Trump. We began by assembling a database of enforcement activity: pulling in information from all fifty states on local raids, family separations, immigration-detention trends, and more. For three months, we scoured law-enforcement blotters, public ICE memos, local news sources, and social-media forums. We then spoke with individuals facing removal proceedings around the country, as well as their attorneys, employers, colleagues, spouses, and children. We’ll be rolling out the results of related investigations in the coming months. But here, we’re sharing one trend that conflicts with Trump’s rhetorical focus on immigrants who “are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers.” In fact, his Administration’s agents are targeting, in large numbers, individuals for whom public-safety justifications for removal don’t apply. This includes a considerable number of women who have no criminal records and who are either the primary caretakers of young children, or the primary family breadwinners, or both. Four such cases are presented here. While Barack Obama’s Administration deported more than three million people, with plenty of non-felons among them, the cases documented here reflect changes from the previous Administration’s enforcement priorities—mothers, for instance, who’d been picked up under Obama and qualified for temporary legal relief, only to face swift removal, or its threat, under the new Administration. These stories offer closeups of Trump-era immigration enforcement—including the words and images of families at their center. This project was produced in collaboration with Adriana Loureiro Fernández, Micah Hauser, Shana Daloria, and Nicole Einbinder. The Candy-Factory Worker

On April 5th, two days after Maribel Trujillo Diaz had visited her local ICE office in Fairfield, Ohio, for a routine appointment, she left her home to see a relative. As she walked, she was followed by ICE agents in a truck. They soon got out and arrested her. Her son, Oswaldo, got a call from someone who’d witnessed the scene, telling him to come quickly. He jumped on his bike, but when he arrived, ICE had already driven off with his mother. Trujillo grew up in Hidalgo, Mexico, in the state of Michoacán, a region now beset by drug cartels. In 2002, when she crossed the border, she was pregnant with Oswaldo. She and her husband, Gustavo, settled in Fairfield—a small city half an hour from Cincinnati—where some family members already lived. Trujillo found work in a poultry plant, and it was there, during a 2007 raid, that she had her first encounter with ICE . According to her attorney, Kathleen Kersh, of the Ohio-based Advocates for Basic Legal Equality, ICE arrested a hundred and sixty individuals after that raid, but Trujillo avoided deportation. In 2012, Trujillo filed for asylum. Life had become dangerous for her relatives back in Mexico; she told a court about how her brother had been kidnapped by members of a cartel called La Familia Michoacana. Other relatives, she said, were also being threatened. In 2014, after two years of hearings, her claim was denied. Trujillo’s four children—fourteen-year-old Oswaldo, twelve-year-old Alexa, ten-year-old Gustavo, Jr., and three-year-old Daniela—were all U.S. citizens, and Trujillo was terrified of being separated from them. Her job at a candy factory provided the family with much of its income. Gustavo has medical conditions that make it difficult for him to work; Daniela, their youngest, experiences seizures. In 2015, Trujillo’s daughter Alexa wrote a letter to Senator Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, begging him to help her mother. “It is not fair what you are doing to my mom. Why does she have to go to mexico she is not a criminal or a bad person,” Alexa wrote. “I’m real going to miss her more cause she is realy far away from me and my family. In the morning when I wake up I’m not goin to see her in bed.” The family was granted a reprieve: ICE chose not to deport Trujillo. As long as she reported for routine check-ins with ICE , she was likely to avoid deportation. Last year, under the Obama Administration, she was granted a one-year work permit that would have expired this July. But within three months of Trump taking office agents picked her up. In the days following Trujillo’s arrest, her case drew widespread attention. Rallies and protests were held in her name, led by friends and family, as well as religious leaders from across Ohio. The state’s most prominent politicians—not just Brown, a progressive Democrat, but also Senator Rob Portman, a Republican—sent personal requests to ICE asking for leniency for Trujillo. Ohio’s Republican Governor, John Kasich, told the press he did not want to see her deported. Father Michael Pucke, Trujillo’s parish priest at St. Julie Billiart Catholic Church, in Hamilton, Ohio, visited Trujillo at the Butler County jail, where he prayed and read scripture with her. Pucke has known Trujillo for more than ten years. “She’s quiet, not someone who would stand out in a crowd, but was thoughtful and had deep faith,” he said. In the jail, he recalled, she was tired, frightened, and cold. “It’s in God’s hands,” she told him. Trujillo asked Pucke to make sure her children did their homework. “That says something to me not only about a mother’s love but how important it was that her children take advantage of what they have in this country,” Pucke said. A few days after her arrest, Trujillo was transferred to La Salle, a detention center in Jena, Louisiana. On April 19th, she was deported to Mexico. Her daughter Alexa had sketched the scene two years earlier, at the end of her letter to Senator Brown; the picture featured Alexa and her siblings watching their mother fly off in a plane, a deportee. The Caretaker

Oregon has been home for as long as Alejandra Ruiz can remember. She wasn’t yet two years old in 1988, when her mother brought her and her older sister to the U.S. from Guatemala, fleeing that country’s civil war. The family lived in California for a short time, then settled in Portland, where her mother found work as a housekeeper. Her mother applied for asylum upon arrival in the U.S., but her case was denied. The government issued a deportation order for Ruiz when she was still a toddler. Her mother never told her about the order—in fact, she did not find out she was undocumented until she was twenty-four-years old. Ruiz grew up thinking she was a U.S. citizen. Three years ago, Ruiz moved with her four kids to Beaverton, a suburb west of Portland. The streets were quiet and the children’s schools were nearby. Ruiz had a job at a senior-care facility, working twelve-hour overnight shifts. Early on the morning of March 26th, ICE agents arrived at Ruiz’s house. She was still at work, but a neighbor called to tell her that law enforcement was knocking at her door; worried, she then called the local non-emergency number, to find out what was wrong. A little while later, an ICE agent called her back. He explained that she was the subject of a decades-old deportation order, Ruiz recalls. If she didn’t come to the local ICE office immediately, agents would return to arrest her. Ruiz arranged for relatives to watch her kids and went to the office. Stephen Robbins, Ruiz’s lawyer, said that her case was the first time he noticed a shift in immigration policies under the Trump Administration. “A lot of the stories we were seeing on the news were people who might have had problems under Obama, too—Alejandra’s case was the first one where it was like, No, this is different,” he said. “During the Obama years, they might have gone to her house and said, ‘Hey, we need you to come in and do a check-in,’ but what would have happened almost certainly is they would have let her go.” At the ICE office, as the hours passed, Ruiz kept thinking they’d soon release her. Instead, shackles were placed around her ankles, wrists, and waist, and she was taken to the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, Washington, a for-profit immigrant-detention facility operated by the GEO Group, a large private-prison firm. In detention, Ruiz barely ate—the food, mainly bread and beans, looked bad and smelled worse. Officers gave her fibre packets and pills, but she refused to take them. She spent time in the center's law library, researching her rights. Talking to her kids on the phone was excruciating. When they spoke at all, it was mostly sobs. Her twelve-year-old daughter was especially distraught. Ruiz didn’t want her kids to know how much she feared being deported to Guatemala—a country where she knew no one. “I haven’t done anything but work here and try to live a normal life with my kids,” she said. Guatemala was a world away. “You hear the stories,” she said—fellow-detainees had told her about the rise of gang violence and lawlessness in the country. “I don’t want to go to there, I don’t want to take my kids there.” Robbins filed a motion to reopen her childhood asylum case, and on March 30th—less than a week after her arrest—Ruiz was released from detention to wait for a deportation hearing. That weekend, she turned thirty-one. She didn’t feel like celebrating. Her kids were elated but terrified, too. Her oldest daughter, Ashley, begged to stay home from school, fearing Ruiz would be gone when she came back at the end of the day. “I feel like everything I’ve worked so hard for was taken from me,” Ruiz said. As she awaits a decision on her case, she has another pressing concern: she lost her job at the senior-care facility during her time in detention. “I started off in a one-bedroom with my kids and worked my butt off to be where I’m at for them,” she said. Now she worries they may soon face eviction and homelessness. “I don’t have a mansion, but I have something for my kids to call their own.” The Apple Picker

Dolores Bustamante Romero was born in a small rural town near Mexico City. She was the second of four children; her mother, who was on her own, struggled to provide for them. At sixteen, Bustamante moved in with a man in his early twenties. “He was nice, at the beginning,” she said. The couple had four kids together, but their relationship soured. “A normal day would be, ‘You’re good for nothing. Who do you think would want you like that?’ ” Dolores said. “That was a normal day.” In 2003, when Bustamante was in her early thirties, a man at work told her that he was going to the U.S.—to New Jersey. “I can help you,” he said. “You don’t have to stay here.” She took up his offer. “It was heartbreaking, because I couldn’t bring all of my children,” she recalled. Bustamante left her three older kids with her mother—she’d send back money to support them—and set out with her youngest daughter, who was then three. After stints cleaning offices and working in factories, Bustamante took up low-wage farm jobs: picking pumpkins, cutting watermelon. An apple-picking gig in upstate New York changed her life. A fellow-farmworker introduced Bustamante to Mujeres Divinas, an organization that helps women working in agricultural jobs. “I found out that not having documents doesn’t mean that we can’t do something,” she said. She also became an active member of her local church, and got involved with the Worker Justice Center of New York, an organization that advocates on behalf of agricultural workers. Bustamante was finally feeling settled. She was supporting her kids back in Mexico and her daughter in New York, and she was proud of that. Then, one morning in October, 2014, she was pulled over while driving to church with her daughter, and arrested by Border Patrol. The Worker Justice Center intervened on her behalf, and Bustamante was released from detention on an order of supervision. For the next few years, her case wound its way through the immigration courts. She paid steep fees to an attorney, who never pressed to have her case administratively closed, which, during the Obama Administration, was a common way for undocumented parents who’d committed no significant crimes to resolve their cases. In February, a new attorney named Jose Perez agreed to take her case pro bono—but by then, he said, the legal landscape had shifted. On March 15th, Dolores stood in a courtroom in Batavia, New York, facing the prospect of imminent deportation. “It felt like a death sentence,” she said, about the prospect of returning to Mexico. “They wanted to kick her out that day,” Perez recalls, of the government’s position in March. But at the hearing, Perez convinced the judge to grant an extension, and in May, he told the court that Bustamante planned to apply for asylum. “I believe she could be in danger if sent back,” he said. Later this month, they’ll return to court, to help determine Bustamante’s fate. “In the previous Administration, we would’ve already closed this case—that is not the situation with the new Administration,” Perez said. “I closed two hundred cases last year, because we had the chance to negotiate with the prosecution based on the deportation priorities,” he said. “I requested to close this case almost as soon as I got it, but the prosecution told me that there was no chance of that happening as things are laid out now.” The Hotel Worker"

It’s Shark Week on the Discovery Channel and, apparently, at the White House , too, as staff infighting becomes a full-on blood sport. How to tune out the mounting madness?

Doreen St. Félix went to hear Kendrick Lamar at the Barclays Center , and found the rapper’s show, with its kung-fu aesthetics, to be “an elegant escapism”; Lauretta Charlton listened to Tyler, the Creator’s new solo album, “Flower Boy,” a surprisingly introspective, grown-up meditation from the “perpetual prankster” of the rap collective Odd Future. Michael Schulman sought respite at the Museum of the Moving Image, in Astoria, where a permanent exhibition dedicated to the salutary genius of Jim Henson has just opened. Carolyn Kormann turned to images of cactuses (yes, “cactuses” is an acceptable form of that plant’s plural), whose “irreverent brutality” is on sumptuous display in a series of images selected from a forthcoming book. And Hua Hsu clued us in to the delightful world of Boo, a rambunctious YouTube star who just so happens to be a capuchin monkey .

As for me, I’m planning to head to the Rubin Museum, to see—or, rather, to hear—“ The World Is Sound ,” a new exhibit exploring the aural aspects of Tibetan Buddhism. In preparation for the show, the museum set up a recording studio, where it invited visitors to lay down their best oms for posterity. The results have been edited into a single chant , an awesome sonic collage of peace and unity. It sure beats screaming into the void.

Another time-tested way to escape reality is with a book, though my latest choice, “ Vanishing New York: How a Great City Lost Its Soul ,” by the writer formerly known as Jeremiah Moss , doesn’t exactly fit that bill. Moss, a cantankerous defender of the city he loves, chronicles its disconcerting metamorphosis from cosmopolitan melting pot to bland corporate lounge with passion and vigor; New York is lucky to have him on its side. If you’re seeking inspiration for something to read, you could consult the Man Booker Long List , just released this past week. (You’ll have to wait until September 12th for Hillary Clinton’s memoir , whose title—“What Happened”—has finally been revealed.) And, last but hardly least, three cheers for Michiko Kakutani , who has retired as the Times’ lead daily book reviewer after thirty-eight years writing for the paper. That’s seven Presidencies’ worth of covering the country’s literary life: thank you, Ms. Kakutani, for your service.

“ The Decline of Opera Queens and the Rise of Gay Opera ,” by Alex Ross. By the seventies and eighties, the venerable opera-queen stereotype—a pre-Stonewall signifier—had receded. But in recent years operas on gay themes have proliferated.

“ Octavia Butler’s Prescient Vision of a Zealot Elected to ‘Make America Great Again’ ,” by Abby Aguirre. In the ongoing contest over which dystopian classic is most applicable to our time, Butler’s “Parable” books may be unmatched.

“ ‘Dunkirk’: A War Movie About Patriotic Ciphers ,” by Richard Brody. The director Christopher Nolan suppresses the mutilations and agonies of war to focus on its basic moral horror.

“ Did a Cancelled Memorial to Norway’s Utøya Massacre Go Too Far? ,” by Peter Schjeldahl. The controversial plans for “Memory Wound,” by the Swedish artist Jonas Dahlberg, differed in instructive ways from other memorials that confront feelings of irremediable loss.

“ Princes William and Harry’s Guarded Confessions in ‘Diana, Our Mother’ ,” by Rebecca Mead. In a new documentary focussing on the Princess’s influence on her sons, light chat over family photos seems contrived to mask a depth of feeling.

“ Why Justin Bieber Got Banned from Performing in China ,” by Jiayang Fan. In a country that is trying to reconcile its system of stringent political control with the porousness of modern culture, even a feckless pop star can be a threat."
http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/an-opera-of-russias-brutal-history,newyorker,An Opera of Russia’s Brutal History,[],"A great nation is in turmoil. A dynasty that everyone assumed would rule forever has extinguished itself; a band of usurpers ride in from the hinterlands, their immense ambition matched by their strange customs and love of bling. Authority is established, but mayhem ensues. Sound familiar?

This isn’t Donald Trump’s Washington, D.C., but Russia in the Time of Troubles, the early-seventeenth-century period in which Antonín Dvořák set his opera “Dimitrij” (1882), which the conductor Leon Botstein is mounting at Bard SummerScape, directed by Anne Bogart, on five nights between July 28 and Aug. 6. A tale of idealism, intrigue, and failed love, it will be the marquee opera in a summer season that otherwise focusses on the musical world of Chopin, who revolutionized the intimate realm of piano music but, to the disappointment of his Polish countrymen, made no contribution to the lyric stage.

Poland figures big in “Dimitrij”: its noblemen give unofficial backing to the so-called False Dmitry—the first of three consecutive rogues who pretended to be the youngest son of Ivan the Terrible—allowing him to invade Russia and, after the unexpected death of Tsar Boris Godunov, assume power. (It’s unlikely that Dvořák and his librettist, Marie Červinková-Riegrová, knew of Mussorgsky’s “Boris Godunov,” but their work begins where that story ends.) “Dimitrij,” like many of the operas that Botstein chooses to present, never really found a place in the repertory, despite its composer’s fame. But the favorable response to the Met’s new production, earlier this year, of Dvořák’s most popular opera, “Rusalka,” may encourage audiences to further explore the lyrical treasures of the Czech master.

Like “Rusalka,” “Dimitrij” is known for a prominent soprano aria. But whereas the former opera’s “Song to the Moon” is a solitary utterance, the aria for Marina, the Polish woman who has married Dimitrij for the sake of power rather than love, is backed by vigorous choral writing, with the Poles celebrating their victory in roisterous mazurka rhythms and the Russian crowd keening their disapproval in strains that echo music of the Russian Orthodox Church. (SummerScape operagoers look forward to the sterling contributions of the Bard Festival Chorale.) Like the water sprite Rusalka, Dimitrij learns too late the fickleness of the human heart. Yet his disaster is no fairy tale—it is inspired by the real-life tragedy of an entire people. ♦"
http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-anthony-scaramuccis-attack-on-reince-priebus-and-steve-bannon-matters,newyorker,Why Anthony Scaramucci’s Attack on Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon Matters,[],"Customarily, when you are in the first couple of weeks of a new job, it’s best to learn the names of the people around you, absorb the rudiments of your new workplace, maybe figure out the lunch situation. This was clearly not the way of Anthony Scaramucci , the new communications director for the Trump White House. The Mooch is a man in a hurry. But while he looks to most like someone racing into a wall, he is, to his patron, doing precisely what is required.

Within moments of arrival, Scaramucci was declaring his everlasting fealty to the President (“I love the President”), erasing the digital evidence of his previous contempt for the President (“an inherited money dude from Queens County”), and comparing his relationship with Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, to that of Cain and Abel, the killer and the killed. And then, the other night, he called Ryan Lizza , of The New Yorker . First, Scaramucci tried in vain to unearth the source who revealed that he had dined at the White House, and wrongly presumed it was Priebus. He then went on an obscene tirade about Priebus’s mental stability, Steve Bannon’s dorsal flexibility, and, most alarming of all, his intention to “fucking kill all the leakers” by employing the capacities, human and technological, of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

“O.K., the Mooch showed up a week ago,” Scaramucci told Lizza. “This is going to get cleaned up very shortly, O.K.? Because I nailed these guys. I’ve got digital fingerprints on everything they’ve done through the F.B.I. and the fucking Department of Justice.” He then ended the nearly nine-minute colloquy by saying, “Yeah, let me go, though, because I’ve gotta start tweeting some shit to make this guy”—meaning Priebus—“crazy.”

The reaction to all this was predictable. It roiled, yet again, the sense of vertigo that has accompanied the Trump era. And there were laughs all around, can-you-top-this jokes on Twitter, gleeful one-liners on late-night television, grave pronouncements on the morning shows. And yet the reaction that matters most was that of Scaramucci’s patron, the President of the United States. Mike Allen, the co-founder of the Web site Axios, wrote, “We’re told the President loved the Mooch quotes.”

Of course he did. After all, Scaramucci was, in language and in manner, channelling Trump himself. What about Scaramucci’s rant could possibly have offended Trump’s sense of propriety, dignity, or politics? As so many audiotapes, tweets, interviews, and speeches have made clear, Trump has no compunction about treating people, even his most self-abnegating loyalists, as vassals; he speaks in the language of obscenity and contempt. What previous President could have delivered an oration so filled with political bile that his host, the Boy Scouts of America , would find it necessary to apologize to anyone who might have been offended? He is unique.

Scaramucci, who was endorsed by Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner , seems to have been installed to carry out Trump’s form of personnel management—to help demean and get rid of retainers who have proved disappointing or threatening to his interests. Sean Spicer . Reince Priebus. Steve Bannon. Jeff Sessions . And, ultimately, Robert Mueller.

In other words, the Mooch matters because the Mooch helps to clarify what matters most to the President and his family. What matters most is Trump’s grip on his base voters and his survival in office. Everything else—a sane health-care policy, the dignity of the transgender people who have volunteered to serve their country , a rational environmental policy, a foreign policy that serves basic democratic values, rule of law—is of tertiary interest.

Trump’s focus is not impossible to divine. He is increasingly anxious that Mueller and congressional investigators are exploring the details of his business transactions and financial holdings, and how they might have exposed him to being targeted by the Russian government.

In the meantime, Trump’s capacity to demean and diminish everyone in his proximity continues apace. H. R. McMaster, the national-security adviser, is said to have an increasingly rocky relationship with the President, and to have been on the receiving end of his contempt; Secretary of Defense James Mattis was informed of the ban on transgender soldiers merely as a courtesy; Secretary of State Rex Tillerson finds himself in a turf battle with Trump’s son- in-law, who believes himself capable of untold diplomatic achievements. How long can these people last? Priebus, Bannon—if they are swept away, do not expect them to be replaced by models of probity.

Last week, while Trump was battling to repeal Obamacare, Scaramucci told CBS, “I don’t know if he’s going to get what he wants next week, but he’s going to get what he wants eventually, because this guy always gets what he wants. O.K.?” Scaramucci matters because he has divined what Donald Trump wants, and he is speaking in his language. Last night, John McCain and many others refused to be cowed or intimidated. They acted in favor of the most elemental notion of rationality and principle. Who else will follow?

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/sadiq-khan-takes-on-brexit-and-terror,newyorker,Sadiq Khan Takes On Brexit and Terror,[],"Fourteen months ago, the election of Sadiq Khan, who is forty-six, to be the first Muslim mayor of a Western metropolis was seen as just another stride in London’s giant, unstopping swagger. The rise of a local boy, the son of a Pakistani bus driver, to govern the seat of a former empire was proof of the same unsentimental indifference toward race and religion, good money and bad, and a past that is gone that has enabled London to more or less detach itself from the reality of its circumstances—the capital of a once great nation in decline—and become a universe unto itself. Seven weeks after Khan took office, however, Britain unexpectedly voted to leave the European Union. The decision revealed a chasm in the country and the way it perceives itself. London was on the losing side. By coincidence, a series of calamities followed. Between March and June of this year, London suffered three terrorist attacks and a fire in a high-rise that killed more than eighty people. Sirens filled the streets. The city felt ill-starred and unsure. There was a fractious general election, in which Theresa May’s Conservative Party barely hung on to power, and the slow, grimly momentous process of leaving the E.U. began. I spent time with Khan during London’s recent disastrous months and I asked him if he had thought that running the city would be this hard. “Nothing prepares you for this,” he said. “I didn’t campaign to be the mayor of London and go to funerals.” On a gray, gusty morning in late June, Khan was in the main chamber of City Hall to take questions from the London Assembly, a quasi-legislative body that oversees his activities. Although London has had a form of self-government since the twelfth century, Khan is only its third directly elected mayor. (The first, Ken Livingstone, took office in 2000.) The newness of the role and the somewhat limited nature of its power is embodied in the form of City Hall, a modest, pebble-like structure on the South Bank of the Thames which both of Khan’s predecessors compared to a testicle. From the chamber, a large window looks across the river to the macho-finance architecture of the Square Mile and, a little to the east, the Tower of London, which has stood for martial authority and the city’s protection since the time of the Norman invasion. Khan was a few minutes early for the session. A small man with a beaky nose and silver hair scraped left to right, he wandered to the back of the room and the public gallery there, which was about two-thirds full, to greet parties of students and schoolchildren who had come to watch. “You O.K.?” he asked each group. “Where you from?” On camera and in interviews, Khan is an overprepared A student, cramming neat answers into the available space. In ordinary conversation, he punctures any formality with self-deprecation and a voice that is fast and London-inflected. He drops the “g” from words like “talking” and “walking.” Before he became mayor, Khan used to perform standup comedy, and laughs followed his progress through the gallery. “Are you a troublemaker?” Khan called out to a large woman in African dress who was taking his photograph. She doubled over in embarrassment. When Khan sat down at a desk, his feet did not quite touch the ground.

The first forty minutes of the meeting were taken up by statements from Khan, recounting London’s latest emergencies. The previous Wednesday, June 14th, Khan had been awoken by his staff at 2 A . M . Grenfell Tower, a public-housing block in West London that was home to some three hundred and fifty people, was on fire. Footage shot by firefighters, and later broadcast on the BBC, caught their astonishment as they confronted the scene: “Mate, how the fuck are we going to do that?” The fire rose from the tower’s fourth floor to the twenty-fourth in around fifteen minutes, apparently fed by the building’s cheap, flammable cladding. The temperature inside reached almost two thousand degrees. The final death toll in Grenfell Tower is still not known, but it was the worst fire in London since the Second World War. The magnitude of the disaster was compounded by its political aspect. When I arrived, at around 10 A . M ., the building protruded from the neighborhood like a dead tooth. Flames lapped out of the seventeenth floor. Families in their bedclothes sheltered under trees. “They want us out of the borough,” a girl in her late teens said. “It’s money, money, money.” Kensington and Chelsea, the local authority that owned the tower, is among the richest in the United Kingdom, and within hours the accident, which killed refugees, disabled people, and children, became an indictment of London’s stark inequality and of the austerity policies of May’s unpopular government. Khan, who is a member of the Labour Party, spent part of each of the following five days at Grenfell Tower, meeting firefighters and police, whom he oversees; attending church services; and talking in the street with residents who were distraught and frustrated by the local government’s response. (The leaders of the Kensington and Chelsea council resigned.) The weather was hot, and Khan worked twenty-hour days. Because it was Ramadan, he was also abstaining from food and water until sunset, at around 9:15 P . M . Five nights after the fire, Khan was woken again, this time shortly after midnight, because someone had driven a rental van into a group of Muslim worshippers returning from late-night prayers in Finsbury Park, in North London. One man was killed, and eleven others were injured. The attack was part of a surge in anti-Muslim hate crime after London’s two previous terrorist incidents, which had involved Islamic extremists driving vehicles into crowds. While Khan delivered his statements to the assembly, ten schoolgirls in blue summer dresses and straw hats filed into the gallery. It was painful to watch them listen to the details of each new horror, each fresh social failing in their city. Khan did his best to counter the mood. “I know Londoners will remain strong and united,” he said. “I know we will come through this.” But he sounded exhausted. A great deal of Khan’s power as a politician comes from the hopeful possibilities that he symbolizes. There were times this summer in London when the fact of his election seemed like one of the city’s only graces. “The almost one good thing that people consistently can feel is that they don’t have to believe the worst inevitability on all sides,” Harriet Harman, a former deputy leader of the Labour Party, told me. “Because actually London elected a Muslim mayor, elected Sadiq.” Opponents and skeptics, however, view Khan as an opportunist, vicious at times, who thinks only in terms of his own advancement. “Yeah, it’s a great symbol,” Andrew Boff, a senior Conservative member of the London Assembly, told me, referring to Khan’s election. “I don’t get the sense there is a profound vision.” Khan’s political career before he became mayor was marked as much by shrewd positioning as by meaningful achievement. “He doesn’t like the difficult questions,” Boff said. “It’s as if he is thinking, If I answer this question, it might damage me in the future.” “Can you describe the shark?” Even people sympathetic to Khan often admit that they underestimated him in the past, and have been forced to adjust their view since he became mayor. “Metaphorically—definitely not literally—he seemed to grow several inches,” a former senior Labour official told me. Khan and his advisers, meanwhile, enjoy his image as an underdog, a realist, and a competitor. (Khan is one of seven brothers, all of whom learned to box.) “His politics come from his experience,” a former aide said. “None of it is in that sense ideological or idealistic.” Khan’s visibility as mayor of London, and his sure-footedness, have led to his being frequently talked about as a future Labour leader, and Britain’s first Muslim Prime Minister. “He is absolutely stardust now,” Harman said. “He knows that, and he respects that.” Polls show Khan to be the most popular politician in the country, and the 1.3 million votes cast for him as mayor give him the third-largest mandate of any politician in Europe. But, in 2017, it is still a long road to persuade large, fearful Western populations to trust their way of life and their security to a leader who is a devout Muslim. Britain’s right-wing press and anti-immigrant lobby are ready should Khan stumble. “They will turn on him,” one of his old law clients told me. “They will turn on him.” And then there is wounded London. The capital has always occupied a morbidly distracting role in British life. In the United States, a city equivalent to London would have a population of forty-three million people and an economy the size of Texas’s and California’s combined. For centuries, London has been an unlovable, pushy place, full of questionable characters and strong appetites that have forced the country around it to change, sometimes against its will. In the eighteen-twenties, the rural campaigner William Cobbett described London as “the Great Wen,” a growing boil on the body of the nation. “People would follow, they must follow,” Cobbett mourned, “the million of money.” It is Khan’s lot to have emerged as a national figure just as London is more vulnerable, and more at odds with the rest of Britain, than at any other point in its recent history. Despite the tragedies of the summer, the capital’s fundamental challenge is its future outside the European Union. Brexit poses an existential threat to the city’s wealth and its identity; one in nine Londoners is from elsewhere in the E.U. In City Hall that morning, the final two questions put to Khan were about the impact of the national government’s current hard-line approach to leaving the E.U., which will cost the capital billions and jeopardize its status as a global bazaar. The Mayor was terse and pessimistic. “If you think we will continue to be able to be as prosperous and successful,” he told the assembly, “think again.”

Khan is a student of American politics, and in describing the role of religion in his public identity he often paraphrases John F. Kennedy: he is not a Muslim mayor; he is a mayor who happens to be Muslim. He allays your concerns before they have a chance to form. Khan characterizes himself as a feminist. He is the first mayor to walk in the city’s gay-pride march. But he is also conscious that he has an obligation to talk about and demystify Islam. “There is a way I define myself,” Khan told me, “and there is a way that others have defined me.” He will quote passages from the Quran and the Hadith, the sayings of the Prophet, when discussing terrorism. When I asked him how to say his name (Urdu speakers pronounce it “Saadik”; English speakers tend to say “Sadeek”), Khan spelled out his name in Arabic—“ sawd alif daal kaaf ”—and explained that it means “truthful.” In 2009, when he was sworn in as a member of the Privy Council, an ancient body of senior politicians, Khan brought his own Quran to Buckingham Palace and left it there, because the palace did not have a copy. Sometimes it is as if he were leading a one-man religious-education exercise. “Many people in positions of power and influence, they have not broken bread with a Muslim,” Khan said. “Part of it is reassuring them: The sky is not going to fall in. You are in safe hands. All the stuff that you worry about, I worry about as well. All the dreams you have got, I have got as well.” As mayor, Khan has made some of his religious practices into political acts. During Ramadan, which began this year in late May, Khan often broke his fast—taking the evening meal known as Iftar—at interfaith events. One evening, I joined him for Iftar at the house of the Catholic Archbishop of London, behind Westminster Cathedral. There were about a hundred people in a grand upstairs room decorated with Latin mottoes and a portrait of the Pope. Among them were boys from Ernest Bevin College, a state school in South London, which Khan attended. In 1985, when Khan was fourteen, the school appointed Britain’s first Muslim head teacher, Syed (Naz) Bokhari, who was a mentor to Khan until his death, in 2011. At the Iftar, Khan was introduced by Bokhari’s son, Harris. Because Britain has no senior Muslim authority, Khan often finds himself in the role by default. The other guests of honor at the Iftar were London’s cardinal, Vincent Nichols, and the country’s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis. Khan was in a relaxed mood; he is never quite genial. When he spoke, he told a few safe jokes and quoted the twelfth-century Islamic scholar Ibn al Jawzi: “I have not seen a flaw in people as great as the flaw of the able not reaching their potential.” Khan continued, “As a city, and as a society, improving how we mix together is one of the biggest challenges we face if we want to reach our full potential.” At 9:19 P . M ., Khan broke his fast with a date and a glass of water. There was food ready, but a small group of the most observant Muslims went downstairs to say the Maghrib, the sunset prayer. Khan went, too, and in a ground-floor office lined with Catholic journals and maps of the English coastline the women covered their heads and the men found the direction of Mecca. In the second row of worshippers, his silver head standing out against the black hair of the boys around him, the Mayor of London put his forehead against the floor.

In retirement, Khan’s father, Amanullah, became a muezzin at the Balham Mosque, in Tooting, the scrappy, polyglot South London neighborhood where the Mayor grew up and still lives. (Khan’s wife, Saadiya, is a lawyer; they have two daughters.) Both of Khan’s parents were from middle-class Muslim families who left India during Partition. In Pakistan, Amanullah’s father was a civil servant; Khan’s maternal grandfather managed a cotton mill. Amanullah studied engineering and served in the Pakistani Air Force before emigrating first to Australia and then to London, where he arrived in the early sixties. He calculated that he could earn more as a bus driver than he could starting out at an engineering firm, and he ended up driving a bus for twenty-five years. In 1967, Amanullah’s wife, Sehrun, and their three children came to join him. When Sadiq Aman Khan was born, in 1970, the family lived on the Henry Prince Estate, a housing project in Earlsfield, a mile or so northwest of Tooting. “It wasn’t ‘Oliver Twist,’ ” he told me. “But it was tough.” Soon, there were four more brothers, and the family of ten squeezed into a three-bedroom apartment. (Khan shared a bunk bed until he was twenty-four, the year he got married.) “All eight of us grew up watching my mum and dad working all the hours God sends,” Khan said. “That was the ethic.” Sehrun did piecework sewing—making dresses for fifty pence an item—late into the night. Amanullah died in 2005, and the downward mobility, the toil, of his parents’ immigrant experience is a mark that has never left Khan. He sees his opportunities in the negation of theirs. On a visit to New York last year, the Mets gave Khan a No. 44 jersey, in honor of his father’s bus route. At school, Khan was a good student who imposed himself in disputes that were not his. “He certainly was very forward,” Rodney Dove, one of his sports coaches, said. “He would take up issues that even I would feel, That is nothing to do with you, Sadiq.” Ernest Bevin was a big, teeming place, with white boys from prosperous middle-class families and a growing number of students from newer Afro-Caribbean and South Asian communities. “Children either had to be macho or very charismatic to survive in that atmosphere,” Vernella Fuller, who was Khan’s tutor for five years, said. “And he was very charismatic.” After classes, Khan went to a madrassa, for instruction in Islam. He would cross the road to avoid skinheads in bomber jackets, members of the National Front, a far-right organization that had a strong presence in Tooting and Earlsfield. People shouted “Paki!” at his father on the bus. “There is a very good reason why all my brothers joined the boxing club,” Khan said. “In our area, on our estate, there were certain things you couldn’t say and get away with. So, if somebody called you the P-word, that means there is a fight. That’s it. We’re having a fight. You couldn’t allow that to be tolerated.”

Khan describes his political awakening as a processing of the injustices that he saw in his daily life: his brothers’ friends being stopped and searched by the police; the Wandsworth bus garage, where his father worked, threatened with closure; his teachers on picket lines. Britain in the eighties was experiencing the fullest—and most painful—extent of Margaret Thatcher’s reforms, aimed at liberalizing and deregulating the country’s postwar industrial economy. The Conservatives were in power. Unemployment was high. Public services were chaotic and underfunded. “Something was happening,” Khan told me. “You’d see it on the TV regularly—jobs being lost, the miners’ strike.” No one else in his family was politically active. Khan’s father took the Daily Telegraph , a conservative newspaper. At fifteen, Khan joined the Labour Party; on Saturday mornings, he would hand out leaflets on Tooting High Street. Khan studied law at the North London Polytechnic and then joined Christian Fisher, a small, distinguished firm dedicated to civil-rights work. Louise Christian had campaigned on behalf of the victims of the Marchioness boat crash, in which fifty-one people drowned in the Thames, in 1989, and Michael Fisher frequently represented suspected I.R.A. members. Khan worked on discrimination cases, often involving employment issues and police misconduct. In 1996, when he was twenty-five, Khan won what was then a record payout of two hundred and twenty thousand pounds from the Metropolitan Police for the wrongful arrest and assault of a Chinese hairdresser. The following year, he was made partner. In the late nineties, Khan began to represent black and Asian police officers, who were themselves suffering discrimination—often in the form of trumped-up corruption investigations. He wore stubble, to make himself look older, and his clients took an almost paternal pride in their bullish young advocate. “I could have gone to hundreds of solicitors,” Ali Dizaei told me. Dizaei is a former commander in the Metropolitan Police, originally from Iran, who was acquitted in 2003 after the most expensive investigation of a single officer in the history of Scotland Yard. “He believed, you know. And that makes a lot of difference to a person of color who wants to take on an organization.” Khan’s colleagues were taken aback by his drive and his capacity for work. “It mystified all of us,” Matthew Ryder, a barrister who worked regularly with Khan, told me. “It was endless, endless. The guy didn’t sleep.” It was the early days of e-mail, and Khan’s clients would hear his computer pinging constantly in the background in his messy office, near the British Museum. When another young lawyer at Christian Fisher, Matt Foot, became a father, Khan advised him to buy a BabyBjörn carrier, so that he could keep his hands free for work. There was something else about Khan that made him stand out. In the eighties and nineties, many of the leading civil-rights lawyers in London came from radical left-wing backgrounds. Foot was from a family of campaigning journalists and politicians, and Christian, who hired Khan, was a candidate for the Socialist Alliance Party in the 2001 general election. Khan never shared their ideological bent. “There is a slight duality about Sadiq,” Foot said, choosing his words carefully. “I think his strong Labour working-class roots are a big part of what he is. I think he has also been very efficient.” Khan’s politics were more results-driven than many of his colleagues’ were. With Ryder, who is half Jamaican and also had a humble London upbringing, Khan was one of the few nonwhite lawyers in his field. In court, the men were sometimes mistaken for their clients. “You are trying to do stuff for people who are your friends, your neighbors, your community,” Khan told me. “That is the law I chose to do.” Ryder, who now works for Khan at City Hall, explained that their backgrounds helped them to see their cases in functional rather than abstract terms. “It was political in terms of vindicating rights,” Ryder said. “It wasn’t political in terms of having a larger agenda.” Khan cut a similarly pragmatic figure in local politics. In 1994, he became a councillor in Tooting. Tooting is part of the borough of Wandsworth (London has thirty-three boroughs, each with its own elected council), which was heavily dominated by the Conservatives. Nationally, however, Labour was on the brink of power. After almost two decades in opposition, the Party had rebranded itself under Tony Blair, enthusiastically embracing the free market, tough policies on crime, and the reform of Britain’s public services. Like most newly elected candidates, Khan was part of the modernizing wing of the Party. “He was a complete Blairite,” Tony Belton, who led the Labour opposition group in Wandsworth, told me. On the council, Khan was a controlled, lawyerly presence. “He doesn’t emote much about his politics,” Belton said. “I don’t think too many people would warm to him, exactly.” Khan doesn’t drink, so he didn’t spend time in the pub with the other councillors. He would come to meetings, and then go. When we spoke, Belton did not find it easy to square his memory of the reserved young councillor with the mayor that he sees now. “It seems to me . . . ,” he said, and hesitated. “It seems to me he must have much more of a strategic grasp than I worked out.”

On April 1, 2002, a young Islamist from Essex named Maajid Nawaz was arrested in a rental apartment in Alexandria, on the northern coast of Egypt. Nawaz, a twenty-two-year-old student, was a member of Hizb ut-Tahrir, a political organization that campaigns for a global caliphate. Hizb ut-Tahrir was allowed to operate in the U.K. but was forbidden under Egyptian law. Nawaz had flown into the country on September 10, 2001, joining several other activists. Now, in the early months of the American war on terror, the government of Hosni Mubarak was rounding up suspected extremists. Nawaz was captured and driven across the desert to Cairo, where he was held in the Tora prison. In England, his family and friends tried to find him a lawyer. At the time, an even more radical offshoot of Hizb ut-Tahrir, called Al-Muhajiroun, was operating; it was later banned in the U.K. A pro-bono legal adviser to members of Al-Muhajiroun, Makbool Javaid, was married to Sadiq Khan’s sister, Farhat. (Javaid and Farhat later divorced.) “Word spread through the grapevine,” Nawaz told me of Khan. “They must have heard that he takes on cases such as these.” Khan flew to Cairo a few months later to meet Nawaz in prison. After 9/11, Britain under Blair had become an active partner in U.S.-led efforts to monitor and break up Islamist movements around the world, and Nawaz was struck by Khan’s intensity. “He was stirred up and riled up,” Nawaz said. “He prays, he fasts. So it could have been him next. There was more to it than just ‘I care about human rights.’ It’s ‘This is my family. This is my community.’ ” Khan went back to Egypt for the trial, but to no avail: Nawaz was convicted of belonging to an unlicensed organization and sentenced to five years in prison. The war on terror created work for civil-rights firms in London, and especially for their Muslim lawyers. London has one of the most diverse Islamic communities on earth. During the second half of the twentieth century, refugees, exiles, and radicals from across the Muslim world ended up living on quiet Victorian streets in Wood Green, Tottenham, and Walthamstow. Khan was in demand. By the early aughts, he was the chair of the legal-affairs committee for the Muslim Council of Britain, the largest representative body in the country. One of his clients, Feroz Abbasi, was imprisoned at Guantánamo Bay. In 2003, counterterrorism police arrested Babar Ahmad, a childhood acquaintance of Khan’s, in Tooting. Khan was the first person to come to the house after the raid, Ahmad told me, “as a councillor, as a lawyer, and a community figure.” Ahmad had fought in the Bosnian war, and was accused of raising money online for the Taliban. He was released after a week. But nine months later, in August, 2004, he was detained again, under the U.K.’s new fast-track extradition treaty with the U.S., and his case became the subject of a national campaign against the agreement. Days after Ahmad’s second arrest, there was a meeting in Tooting, where Khan was the main speaker. “ ‘I know Babar, we play football together,’ ” Saghir Hussain, another civil-rights lawyer, recalled him saying. “ ‘He is not as good as me, but we are going to fight these cases.’ ” Khan was also running for Parliament. Tooting was a safe Labour seat, and in early 2004 Khan was among more than a hundred candidates to replace the outgoing M.P., Tom Cox, in the next election. His main rival, Stuart King, another young Blairite councillor, had trade-union support and more local endorsements. King also thought he had more free time to campaign: Khan had a young family and a hectic law practice. “Where is he going to find the time to do it?” King asked. But Khan made a list of every Labour member in the constituency that would select the candidate—around seven hundred people—and spoke to them individually. “We were tracking: Who have I spoken to? Who do I have to go back to? Who do I need to firm up?” an aide who worked on the campaign told me. “He was just out all the time.” Khan won the selection easily. He left the law, and in May, 2005, he was one of three hundred and fifty-five Labour M.P.s elected in Tony Blair’s third victory as Prime Minister. Four were Muslim. The war in Iraq was desperately unpopular in Britain’s Islamic communities; there had also been major riots in the North of England in the summer of 2001, in towns deeply divided between their white and Asian populations. The government was anxious to find liberal, mainstream Muslims who could speak up for its positions. “We needed someone who could feature on the BBC,” Mike O’Brien, a Foreign Office minister, told me. O’Brien suggested to Khan that he might focus on issues affecting British Muslims when he arrived in Westminster, but Khan balked. “He said, ‘No. That is not how I want to be seen,’ ” O’Brien recalled. “I just wanted to be a mainstream M.P.,” Khan told me.

Nine weeks after Khan entered the House of Commons, four British Muslims blew themselves up in subways and on a bus during rush hour in London, killing fifty-two people and injuring seven hundred others. The attacks, on July 7, 2005, remain the country’s worst terrorist incident, and raised traumatic questions about how ostensibly well-integrated young Muslim men—the leader of the bombers, Mohammad Sidique Khan, worked in a primary school—could become suicide bombers. “They were Sadiqs,” one Labour peer told me. “On the seventh of July, things changed,” Khan said. He watched as academics, the government, and Muslim community leaders struggled to analyze what had happened. “You can’t vacate the field when you are a member of that faith, and you think in a non-arrogant way you know more than them,” he said. Khan went to see Harman, who had also been a civil-rights lawyer and was now a senior figure in the Party. Harman had been one of a handful of female Labour M.P.s when she was first elected, in 1982, and she told Khan that initially she hadn’t wanted to work on women’s issues. “ ‘You have got no choice,’ ” Khan remembered her saying. “ ‘Because, if you don’t, who will? And the others that will aren’t as good as you.’ ” In Parliament, Khan maintained an independent streak. In November, 2005, he voted against Draconian antiterrorism legislation, helping to bring about Blair’s first defeat in the House of Commons as Prime Minister. But Khan was also prepared to be a team player. He met with Blair and took part in Home Office initiatives aimed at engaging with British Muslims after the July 7th attacks. Some of Khan’s former colleagues watched these gestures with dismay. Matt Foot caught a glimpse of Khan on the news, lining up with other Muslim activists to shake Blair’s hand at a Labour Party Conference. “I remember shouting at the telly,” Foot said. “What a disgrace.” Saghir Hussain, who had worked with Khan on the Babar Ahmad campaign, sensed that now he wasn’t pushing the issue hard enough in Westminster. When Nawaz was released from prison, he heard that Khan could no longer be trusted. His departure from Christian Khan, as the firm had become, had been acrimonious, and ended with a dispute over money. “I remember Louise Christian saying, ‘We think he has sold out,’ ” Nawaz recalled. (Christian declined to be interviewed for this article.) In early 2007, Khan became a parliamentary aide to Jack Straw, who, as Foreign Secretary, had overseen the invasion of Iraq. The following year, Khan helped push through the House of Commons antiterrorism legislation that would have enabled police to detain suspects for up to six weeks without charging them. (The provision was ultimately defeated in the House of Lords.) For many civil-rights campaigners, Khan’s work on the bill was proof that his personal ambition had overcome any previous scruples. “That is a shocking thing. It really is,” Foot said. “I think he gets a pass from a lot of white people, the well-intentioned ones,” Hussain said. “They want diversity, do you know what I mean? So he can play them, but he can’t play people who know him, and know him well.” As a junior M.P., Khan acquired a reputation as a skilled and discreet go-between in the House of Commons. “He is in essence a moderate, sensible guy,” O’Brien said. But he had to contend with the same prejudices that affected other British Muslims. In February, 2008, a former police officer admitted to the Sunday Times that Khan had been secretly recorded on visits to see Babar Ahmad in prison in 2005 and 2006. Although visitors to terrorism suspects were routinely bugged by the security services, since the sixties a convention known as the Wilson Doctrine had forbidden eavesdropping on M.P. s. An inquiry laid the blame for the surveillance on an administrative oversight, but many believed that Khan was a victim of racial profiling. “I am absolutely certain that the fact that he had a Pakistani name meant that they made immediate assumptions,” Straw said. Ahmad, who eventually served two years in solitary confinement in a supermax prison in Connecticut, found the episode almost comic. “Look at this guy,” he told me. “He has been a Labour Party member all his life. He has been a councillor. He is an M.P. But that is not enough to take the finger of suspicion away. It was funny. People were, like, Poor Sadiq—after all this time, it hasn’t got him anywhere.” But Khan wasn’t always a victim. After Nawaz was released from prison in Egypt, he renounced political Islam and returned to the U.K. to set up a counter-extremism think tank called Quilliam. During an interview with Iranian TV, in 2009, Khan, who was by then a junior minister, referred to the group and other moderate Muslims as “Uncle Toms,” a phrase that he later said he regretted using. Part of Khan’s skill as a politician is having the right idiom for whomever he is speaking to at any given moment. Nawaz, who is now a radio talk-show host in London, observed that Khan has never apologized to him personally, despite the many times they have spoken. “It’s inescapable that Saadik-known-as-Sadeek has used his Muslim identity to advance his political career,” he told me. “Back then, he was clever enough to know where to get the clients from. Now he is clever enough to know where to get the votes from.” In 2010, Khan was in danger of losing his seat in Parliament. After thirteen years in power, Labour was in retreat across the country. O’Brien recalled seeing Khan at a drinks party in Downing Street, where he talked about returning to practice law. In the general election, the Conservatives targeted Khan with a high-profile campaign in Tooting. The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, put up an antiwar South Asian candidate named Nasser Butt, who had the potential to split the Labour vote in the constituency. “I became an immediate threat to Sadiq’s Muslim-vote bank,” Butt told me. However, Butt belonged to an Islamic sect, the Ahmadiyya, that holds theological beliefs different from those of mainstream Sunni Islam, the predominant branch in the U.K. During the campaign, Liberal Democrat posters were torn down and Butt suffered anti-Ahmadi abuse. At an election event at the Tooting Islamic Centre, the Conservative candidate, Mark Clarke, who is mixed race, had to be locked in a room for his own protection, after being mistaken for Butt; Butt was advised to stay away altogether. Although he blamed activists from the center, which is attached to the Balham Mosque, for the discrimination during the election, Butt was convinced that Khan was also involved. “He was part of it,” he said. “I was quite sure he was directing it.” Khan has always denied any wrongdoing. But on May 3, 2010, two days before the election, Butt sent his son to secretly record a meeting at the Islamic center. Butt gave me a copy of the recording. On it, a speaker identified as Harris Bokhari, the son of Khan’s old head teacher and mentor, addresses the room. “The majority of Muslims in this area are voting Lib Dem, because they think Nasser Butt is a Muslim,” Bokhari says. “You need to go into the community and take these posters down.” One man at the meeting asks Bokhari how to fill in his ballot papers. “All you need to do is just look for Sadiq Khan, Labour Party, and just tick it,” he says. “Whatever else you vote is up to you.” Bokhari told me that he does not remember the meeting. Khan held his seat by less than three thousand votes.

People seeking to explain Khan’s rise often talk about his gift for knowing what the mood is. “Is ‘chameleon’ the right word? Maybe. No, he is more of a submarine,” a former senior official in Gordon Brown’s government, which succeeded Blair’s, in 2007, said. “He sort of rose without trace.” Khan was the campaign manager for Ed Miliband, the less fancied of two brothers who contested the Labour leadership after the Party’s defeat in 2010. Khan’s candidate won, and he became the Shadow Justice Secretary, tracking and opposing government changes to the legal system, but he wasn’t considered a future star. He rambled in media interviews, and was marginalized by other, more polished members of Miliband’s team. In 2013, Khan became the Party’s Shadow Minister for London—a natural vehicle for a mayoral bid—but he wasn’t widely seen as an obvious contender for the office. “I always found him perfectly nice,” a former Party official said. “I just never had a particularly high opinion of him.” In May, 2015, Labour lost a second consecutive general election, allowing David Cameron and the Conservatives to form their first majority government in eighteen years. Khan’s mayoral campaign started out three days later, in two rooms rented from a polling company on the Commercial Road, a noisy, scruffy thoroughfare in East London. The conventional wisdom was that Miliband had moved Labour too far to the left; the immediate front-runner to be the Party’s mayoral candidate was Tessa Jowell, a centrist former minister under Blair who had helped bring the Olympics to the city in 2012. Khan, by contrast, seemed unsure how to define himself. The first draft of his campaign message was downbeat. “It was a bit misery: I share your pain; we can make things better,” Polly Billington, a former Miliband adviser who worked for Khan that summer, told me. Billington tried out the message on a group of campaign volunteers, some as young as seventeen. “We got them in a room and said, ‘This is what we are doing at the moment—what do you think of it?’ ” she recalled. “They were, like, That’s not the London I recognize. I love living in London. It’s hard. It needs to be better, but it is bloody brilliant.” Khan’s team began to build a feel-good campaign, highlighting lower mass-transit fares and a major new house-building program, with his uplifting biography at the center. “People actually thought his story about London—him saying his story was the story of London—would alienate the affluent,” Billington said. “But we said, No, no. They want to believe it’s true. It’s like the American Dream.” The mayoral primary campaign ran in parallel with the next contest for the Labour leadership. In June, Khan was one of thirty-six M.P.s who nominated Jeremy Corbyn , a socialist outsider whose rallies unexpectedly caught the imagination of the Party’s membership. Khan has always insisted that he backed Corbyn merely to insure that there was a range of candidates, but he benefitted from the surge of energy on the left. “There was only one reason he nominated Corbyn, and that was to sweep up the Corbyn supporters,” the former Downing Street official said. Khan campaigned for mayor in all thirty-three boroughs and spoke at more than two hundred events. Criticism from his former colleagues didn’t damage him at all. He won the final round of voting by nearly twenty per cent. Eight days later, he distanced himself from Corbyn, who had become Labour’s new leader, in an interview with the right-wing Daily Mail . “I will be my own man,” Khan said. The Conservative Party’s choice for mayor was Zac Goldsmith, an M.P. from Richmond. As a whole, the capital tends to vote Labour. In 2015, the Party held forty-five of London’s seventy-three parliamentary seats. But, between 2008 and 2016, the mayor was Boris Johnson, a popular, seemingly shambolic figure, who showed that the Tories were capable of winning City Hall. In his own way, Goldsmith also appeared able to reach across the city’s traditional divides. The son of a billionaire, he was tall, good-looking, and a committed environmentalist. On the campaign trail, though, he was diffident and underpowered—except when the subject was Khan. Over and over, Goldsmith depicted his opponent as a radical (the word “Muslim” was elided) with potentially extremist views. “I am up against somebody who poses a real danger to London,” Goldsmith told the Guardian last March. “I’m absolutely convinced of it.” “This is nothing like the photo on Airbnb.” Conservatives in the London Assembly sensed the miscalculation immediately. “It was a shit campaign,” Andrew Boff said. Goldsmith plowed on. In the spring of 2016, the Tories sent letters intended for various ethnic minorities in London who might be disturbed by the prospect of a Muslim mayor. “Sadiq Khan Will Put London’s Future And Your Community At Risk,” read one letter, aimed at the city’s Tamils, warning of taxes on “your family’s heirlooms.” Senior Tories, including May, who was then the Home Secretary, and Cameron, the Prime Minister, declared that London would be unsafe under Khan. Right-wing newspapers trawled through his former clients and looked for past instances when he had shared platforms with Islamists. A video surfaced of Javaid, his ex-brother-in-law, giving an anti-Western speech. Two weeks before the election, speaking in the House of Commons, Cameron accused Suliman Gani, Khan’s former imam in Tooting, of supporting the Islamic State. Labour M.P.s shouted “Racist!” in reply. “I think they are shouting down this point because they don’t want to hear the truth,” Cameron responded. In public, Khan made light of the tactics. “Hey @ZacGoldsmith,” he tweeted. “There’s no need to keep pointing at me & shouting ‘he’s a Muslim.’ I put it on my own leaflets.” Two weeks before the election, Khan had a sixteen-point lead in the polls. Cameron was forced to apologize to Gani after it turned out that he had never backed the Islamic State, and had fallen out with Khan over Khan’s support for same-sex marriage. A few Tories broke ranks. “If @SadiqKhan isn’t an acceptable enough Muslim 2 stand for London mayor, which Muslim is?” Sayeeda Warsi, a former chairman of the Conservative Party, tweeted. Khan’s team found the viciousness of the Goldsmith campaign unsettling. “I don’t think they realized quite how dangerous a game they were playing,” a senior Khan aide told me. Last June, Jo Cox, a Labour M.P., was murdered by a right-wing extremist during Britain’s E.U. referendum campaign. Khan’s social-media feeds are jammed with alt-right Pepe frogs and Islamophobic junk. “Sadiq is probably the most blasé about his security,” the aide said. “We are all much more stressed about it.” On May 6th last year, Khan was elected mayor of London with fifty-seven per cent of the vote. At the count, the candidate from Britain First, a far-right party, turned his back. “I want to say thank you,” Khan said, “to every single Londoner for making the impossible possible.”

Khan’s office at City Hall is on the eighth floor. A large black-and-white photograph of Muhammad Ali hangs in the corner. At around 7 A . M . on June 24th last year, just as it was clear that Britain had voted to leave the European Union, the Mayor was on the phone, making his way through a list of calls to the Bank of England and to the heads of the biggest businesses in the capital. “We were grief-stricken,” he told me. “It was like we were in mourning.” Brexit made plain divided ways of thinking in British society—between young and old, educated and less well educated, urban and rural—that the country’s traditional party politics had previously been able to disguise. Along with Scotland and Northern Ireland, London—whose population dwarfs both of those—was the only region in the U.K. that chose decisively to stay in the E.U. In Central London, where the nation’s political, financial, and cultural power is held, the results were overwhelming. Seventy-five per cent of voters in Wandsworth, where Khan lives, chose to remain. For many Londoners, waking up on the wrong side of an almighty national decision was a vertiginous, disorienting feeling. Cameron, who had called the referendum, resigned. “I remember just thinking, Oh, my God,” one of Khan’s senior advisers said. “What have we done?” There will be places in Britain, and aspects of its way of life, that will be entirely unaffected by Brexit. There will be specific situations where things improve. But London will not be one of them. Most people date the city’s current flourishing—the money, the food, the art, the good-looking people, the tourists astonished at the cost of public transport, the tech dreamers, the Russians digging out basement saunas, the coffee—more or less to 1986, and a wave of Thatcherite financial deregulation known as the Big Bang. London had begun to recover from the Second World War in the sixties, but the Big Bang allowed the city to resume its historic role as a global marketplace and the maker of time zones. It also positioned London as the undisputed financial capital of the E.U. As the Single Market, the E.U.’s economic structure, integrated in the nineties, with so-called “passporting rights,” which allowed businesses and banks to trade freely across the Continent, the city sucked people and law firms and entrepreneurs from Lisbon and Paris and Berlin. Between 2005 and 2015, the number of E.U. citizens in London doubled, to almost a million. The city grew faster than at any time in the previous century. Brexit won’t undo all of this, but withdrawing from the E.U.—withdrawing from anything—is antithetical to London’s accretion of people and capital during the past thirty years. “We are a hub leaving a network,” Alex Barker, the Brussels chief of the Financial Times , told me. “That is a big bloody problem.” Estimates suggest that, if the U.K. leaves the Single Market, London’s financial sector alone will lose around twenty billion pounds a year and shed between thirty thousand and seventy thousand jobs. But, until the terms are final, Brexit exists more as an unravelling, a kind of die-off, of London’s precious thickness. Pieces of the ecosystem that you didn’t know were there—the city’s eight-hundred-billion-pound-a-day euro clearing market—are unlikely to survive in their present form. In late May, migration statistics showed that E.U. citizens are already leaving the country, undermining London’s economy, and, in particular, its construction, health-care, and tourism sectors. “The hemorrhage has begun, the flight has begun,” Sean McKee, the policy director of the London chamber of commerce, told me. The disparity between the capital’s needs and those of the rest of the country has fostered a strain of London nationalism. It has also put pressure on Khan to be an advocate for the city and to champion its cosmopolitan outlook. The morning after the referendum, City Hall started using the hashtag #LondonIsOpen, a catchall slogan that seemed to defy the result. At the same time, Khan’s immigrant background, centrist policies, and close identification with the city have allowed people to believe that he may emerge as a Macron-like savior in the post-Brexit landscape. One morning this spring, I went to watch as Khan presided over an annual citizenship ceremony at City Hall. A pink #LondonIsOpen flag flew next to the Thames, alongside the Union Jack and an E.U. standard. Under his mayoralty, the event had a new edge. Khan’s face broke into a smile as the new citizens, one from each borough, swore their oath of allegiance to the Queen in a mixed chorus of accents. Afterward, I spoke to Stanislava Saffova, a Slovakian trainee psychotherapist, who had decided to apply for British citizenship on the morning of the Brexit vote. Saffova, who was wearing a floor-length white gown, had been living in London for eleven years. “That was a bit like, Oh, my God, I am not welcome anymore,” she said. She watched Khan moving among the new Britons. “It is a very encouraging story that he has to tell,” Saffova said. “Especially for people like us.” “I should have known—I hate the beach.” But some London politicians and pro-business lobbyists are frustrated that Khan hasn’t done more to agitate on behalf of the capital. In part, he has been hemmed in by the policies of the national Labour Party: outside London, the Party’s traditional white working-class base voted heavily to leave the E.U., and Corbyn, a longtime Euroskeptic, has been a meek opponent of May’s severe interpretation of the result. But London has its own heft. The capital contributes thirty per cent of the nation’s tax revenue, as much as the next thirty-seven cities combined. And yet Khan, unlike Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of Scotland’s devolved government (which contributes around eight per cent of the U.K.’s tax), has not managed to secure a formal say in the negotiations and the final Brexit deal. “With a mandate his size, he can bang the table,” McKee said. Last November, at City Hall, the chamber of commerce and a range of business groups launched a proposal for a new “London visa,” along with reforms to the U.K.’s immigration system, to protect the capital’s economy. Khan did not attend. “There are moments when you clear your diary and you actually say, I am getting behind this stuff,” McKee said. “We need our mayor.” When I asked Khan about his apparent reticence, he stressed that London should not further separate itself from the rest of the U.K. “I have got to be pragmatic and work with a Tory government,” he said. “That may not please those who want me to posture and pose.” But the other explanation is that Khan wants to be Prime Minister one day, at which point he will have to win over a national following that is inherently more skeptical toward his faith and the kind of society that he represents. “If he becomes ‘Remainer-in-Chief,’ that is a big problem when he wants England to vote for him,” the former Downing Street adviser said. Khan knows all this. He is a deliberate character, who studies the angles. “You can hear the argument going on in his office and in his own head,” another former Party official told me.

On April 18th, May called a snap general election, surprising the country. Her stated reason for the vote, which would take place seven weeks later, was to gain a strong mandate for the upcoming Brexit talks, which were due to start in June. But she also had an irresistible target: Corbyn’s Labour Party was weak and drifting. May, who succeeded Cameron last July, had an untroubled first nine months in office, and she had the opportunity to win a landslide majority in the House of Commons. Ten days after her announcement, the Conservatives had a nineteen-point lead in the polls. Calling an early election also had the happy consequence of complicating Khan’s timetable for a return to national politics. If he serves two terms as mayor, the earliest that he could now theoretically become Prime Minister is 2027. Once the campaign began, however, May turned out to be awkward and aloof. The Conservative Party manifesto seemed to take its voters, particularly the elderly, for granted. On May 22nd, with the election less than three weeks away, a suicide bomber blew himself up in the foyer of an arena in Manchester where Ariana Grande was giving a concert, killing twenty-two people and injuring dozens of others, many of them young girls. The attack, which was the worst in the U.K. since the 2005 bombings, unnerved the country, and focussed attention on Britain’s strained public services—its police and hospitals—which have had their funding squeezed by Tory-led governments for the past seven years. Corbyn, by contrast, announced a series of popular policies, such as the cancellation of student debt. Khan campaigned almost solely in the capital, where he is Labour’s most popular asset. “I think you will find a lot of Labour candidates in London, the person they wanted on their leaflets was not Jeremy Corbyn but Sadiq,” an M.P. in the city told me. On the Saturday before the election, Khan was addressing volunteers for Dr. Rosena Allin-Khan, his successor as Tooting’s M.P., before heading to the east of the city to stump for candidates in Dagenham and Ilford. In Tooting, Khan stood on a small table plastered with red-and-yellow placards to fire up a crowd of about a hundred Labour activists penned into the narrow courtyard of a local business center. “For those at the back, I am standing on a table,” Khan said. Big laugh. Khan is aware of what his supporters see in him, and of both the immediate and the international contexts of his mayoralty. Khan first clashed with Donald Trump last May, after Trump, as a candidate, proposed a ban on Muslims entering the United States. In Tooting, Khan goaded the activists with memories of the populist victories of 2016. “You need to remind yourself how you felt when you stayed up during the night to watch the results of the Brexit vote. I want you to remember how you felt when you watched the American elections in November,” Khan said. “We don’t want to feel that way.” Whenever he can, Khan travels by public transport. That day, he was accompanied by a single aide. He walked back toward the Tooting Broadway tube station, stopping every minute or so to shake hands, or to pose for a selfie. “Let’s do it!” he said each time, as enthusiastic as the last. A woman with a yoga mat said she wasn’t sure about Corbyn. “He’s not standing here,” Khan shot back. An elderly woman pushing a shopping cart raised a hand in greeting. “How is Father?” Khan called out. “Say hello to him from me, O.K.?” As we passed a brunch place on the other side of the road, Khan hollered to the waiting queue, “Have the sourdough and avocado!” At the station, he checked that this article would appear after the election and predicted that May would win. That night, after breaking his fast, Khan was watching television with his wife when one of his aides texted. Just after 10 P . M ., three men in a white van had driven across London Bridge, not far from City Hall, and mounted the sidewalk at around fifty miles an hour, attempting to run down as many people as possible. The atrocity replicated the tactics of the attack on Westminster Bridge, in March, in which four people died. But this time, when the van crashed, the men emerged armed with long knives, and slashed at people drinking in Borough Market, a popular hive of bars, pubs, and restaurants. Eight people were killed in eight minutes before armed police arrived and shot the men. London went on high alert for what the British security services call an M.T.F.A.—a marauding-terrorist firearms attack—of the type carried out in Paris in November, 2015. Khan worked the phone from home. He once described to me the standard thoughts of Western Muslims upon hearing about a terrorist attack. “First thing is, Please let nobody have died,” he said. “Secondly, you think about the families, and you think, Oh, God. And then, thirdly or fourthly, you are thinking, Oh, please, God, let the person responsible not claim to be doing this in the name of Islam, because the fifth or sixth process is having to explain that this has nothing to do with your faith.” I reached the emergency cordon at Borough Market at around noon the following day. The tide was high, and a black, high-powered police boat gunned around on the river. The market is a recognizable artifact of twenty-first-century cosmopolitan London. It is where I remember first trying chorizo. In a small cul-de-sac of houses, a few hundred yards from where the attackers were killed, a middle-aged Muslim woman stood next to her plants. “One woman was stabbed fifteen times,” she said. “Can you imagine, a knife going through you fifteen times?” Her neighbor, a young Dutch economist named David Verdam, had been hosting a party the night before. As the crowds ran away from the market, he opened his door, and some Polish tourists took refuge. Of the eight people who died, seven were born outside the U.K. Verdam talked about the Brexit vote and the rising hostility toward immigrants, and worried about the possible impact on the election, which was four days away. In the way that it did in London this summer, it seemed hard to separate the violence from politics, and a sense of things coming apart. “The bagels—they just keep getting bigger, no?” Khan spent the morning with the emergency services and giving interviews. In a statement, he advised Londoners that there would be more police on the streets and urged them not to be alarmed by their presence. At noon, he was trolled by Trump. “At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ‘no reason to be alarmed!’ ” the President tweeted. Khan hadn’t slept. He was still mid-crisis. “The basic rule amongst politicians and amongst leaders is a sense of solidarity—it is almost like our version of NATO Article 5,” he told me. “So I was extremely surprised when the President of the U.S.A., our strongest ally, said what he said. It was disappointing, to be honest.” When a spokesperson for Khan said that Trump had taken the Mayor’s words out of context, the President tweeted again, calling it a “pathetic excuse.” I asked Khan if he knew why he had got under Trump’s skin. “The short answer is I don’t know, but I can understand if we were both aged twelve years old,” he said. At City Hall, there was only one flag, the Union Jack, at half-mast. From Tower Bridge, I looked back upriver. The city shivered with its usual slower Sunday rhythm: the river, the sky, a thousand moving parts. Except on London Bridge, where six red buses stood in a line, with the rest of the traffic stopped around them, frozen from the night before, like a stuck section of film."
http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/are-new-york-taxis-such-a-bad-investment,newyorker,Are New York Taxis Such a Bad Investment?,[],"I recently attended a private-equity conference where a speaker, a TV pundit, abruptly shifted from offering tidbits from the Trumposphere to random life advice: “You have to ask yourself whether you want to be Uber or one of those dying yellow-taxi companies?” Even with bad news dripping daily from Uber, everyone in the audience knew the right answer. Who would choose death?

Just a few days earlier, I had a long conversation with the owner of a New York City yellow-taxi fleet about the economics of his business. I called him after learning about the stunningly low price that someone had paid to buy a medallion to operate a yellow cab in the city: two hundred thousand dollars. (Later, in June, an even lower price was reported: a hundred and fifty thousand dollars .) In the spring of 2014, medallions were at their peak, with sales at 1.3 million dollars apiece. The medallion owner, who agreed to talk only if I wouldn’t use his name, bemoaned Uber “not playing by the rules,” but asserted that the taxi business wasn’t dead. Since Uber came to the city, in 2011, his fleet’s revenue was down only about twenty per cent. That’s a lot, but if you can buy medallions for ninety per cent less to operate in a business that’s down twenty per cent, the conditions may be ripe for a value investment—like buying real estate in 2009. Some institutional investors are tantalized . But purchasing a yellow-cab medallion, even at these prices, requires a strong stomach. It’s a bet not just on a piece of New York but on the direction of our tech-spun, higgledy-piggledy world of regulation, employment, and taste.

The number of tin, hood-installed medallions, now at 13,587, is fixed by New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission, which also protects yellow cabs’ two most precious rights: picking up people hailing on the street and picking up passengers from the dedicated lines at LaGuardia and J.F.K. Airports. There is a value to these rights, but, as happened with art , wine, horses, and houses over the last decade, the medallions became financial assets, too. And all the familiar inflators of bubbles came along: cheap, easy, and imprudent debt; the presumption that medallion prices could never go down (because, well, they had almost never gone down ); and the cartoonish greed of a few participants.

Something was going to prick this bubble, and it was Uber. Popped bubbles are always a mess. One medallion lender, Montauk Credit Union, was taken over by the State of New York, and later merged with a credit union in Bethpage, Long Island. The fleet owner told me that other banks are holding on to foreclosed “tins,” praying for the market to turn. In May, 2017, the average number of medallions working per day was only 12,159 —confirming than many of their possessors are not using them to generate fares. And there is not a stable price for tins. The Taxi and Limousine Commission list of medallion transfers in June reported nine transactions ranging from a hundred and fifty thousand to four hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars apiece.

But just because a bubble has popped doesn’t mean that the underlying business is worthless. As recently as last fall, according to a comprehensive study by Schaller Consulting, more people took yellow cabs than took app-hailed competitors: seventeen million passengers per month versus fifteen million. In May of this year , the average medallion generated almost exactly four hundred dollars per day in revenue. This is down from almost five hundred dollars per day in 2013, but it’s not nothing: as a medallion owner, you can still get about fifteen hundred dollars per month by leasing your medallion to someone else who operates the cab. Assuming you can find a medallion for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars, those numbers translate to an annual yield of twelve per cent. That’s not a get-rich-quick scheme, but it’s a reasonable investment presuming one condition: that when you want to sell the medallion, you can at least get your money back.

This is a bet that yellow-cab economics are stable, and, implicitly, a bet on the three key factors determining those economics.

The central factor is whether yellow cabs and ride-hailing services will eventually be equally regulated. “The crazy streets are out of fucking control,” the fleet owner told me. His loudest, most foul-mouthed complaints are about three regulations in particular: taxis’ fixed fares; a fifty-cent-per-ride surcharge paid by taxi riders, which subsidizes New York City’s public-transit system; and an agreement by taxi owners that half of all yellow cabs will eventually be wheelchair accessible. Uber is bound by none of these rules.

The cab owners have pressed for—and achieved—some parity of regulation. As explained to me by Michael Woloz, the spokesperson for the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade, which represents the owners of about a third of the medallions, “all drivers must now get a universal license with more or less the same requirements for driving for ‘yellow’ and for Uber.” Also, an Uber car in New York City cannot be your spare hatchback; it must be an official T.N.C.—transportation-network company—vehicle affiliated with a base station where automobiles are serviced and parked. In New York, Uber has had to buy dozens of base stations .

These victories aside, most New Yorkers are more familiar with the taxi industry’s failure to achieve its loudest demand: capping the growth of app-hailed competitors. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who received significant donations from the taxi industry , tried. Uber responded with one of the brattier moves from a company infamous for its brattiness: it installed “de Blasio” mode on its app, conveying the night-of-the-living-rideless horrors of a city without Uber. (No cars would be available, or the wait time would be twenty-five minutes.) De Blasio caved .

The second important factor in the matter of yellow-cab economics is the question of which form of transport will have an easier time attracting cars’ necessary element: drivers. The taxi-fleet owner told me, categorically, that many drivers are “coming back to yellow” because they can make a better living than “with the app.” There is anecdotal evidence of this in other news stories, and emotional weight from the “ I’m bankrupt because of you ” video, which shows an Uber driver talking to Travis Kalanick, the company’s former C.E.O.. Both yellow and Uber are competing on softer measures. Uber opened up fancy driver-relations centers. Taxi owners are offering free legal representation to cabbies for driving-related offenses. Uber, just last month , started allowing tips and instituting higher cancellation charges—moves that benefit drivers but may make the service less attractive to passengers. The taxi industry points out that Uber is also on the forefront of trying to get rid of drivers altogether, with autonomous vehicles .

The questions about regulations and labor merge into a final bet: What do consumers want? Consumers, taking roughly equal numbers of T.N.C. cars and taxis today, differ on their view of the tactile experience. Woloz contends that real New Yorkers like to hail taxis, and, like him, I enjoy lifting my arm and stepping into a cab while some schmuck is staring at his phone wondering why his Uber missed a turn on Seventh Avenue.

Consumers also care about price. A bet on taxi medallions shouldn’t be a bet on the sudden extinction of ride-hailing apps. They aren’t going away. In Austin, for instance, when Uber and Lyft left the city after a regulatory dispute , the locals were temporarily worried about how they could transport themselves (and their growlers) between food trucks, until new local ride-hailing apps, including a nonprofit service, appeared almost overnight. One can, however, bet that Uber and its peers will get more expensive. Uber gobbled up market share by offering convenience but also by subsidizing the end user’s experience with investor capital. (The company, which has raised at least fifteen billion dollars , lost 3.8 billion dollars in 2016 alone.) Any difficulty that the besieged company has raising billions more will force it to find a way to make a profit.

In the end, what consumers want intersects with what consumers believe. New Yorkers, famously liberal, decry deregulatory impulses and income inequality and immigrant-bashing, but they flock to new technologies that profit from less regulation and lower the income of—and might one day eliminate—working-class, usually immigrant-held jobs. There are likely safer investments than taxi medallions: nobody has ever won money betting on the consistency of New Yorkers’ (or anyone’s) values and spending habits. But buying a tin for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars, betting that New Yorkers, like the Statue of Liberty, will keep their cab-hailing arms raised forever, may not be the craziest place to start."
http://www.newyorker.com/sections/business/the-strange-defense-of-martin-shkreli,newyorker,The Strange Defense of Martin Shkreli,[],"On Wednesday, June 28th, the criminal-defense attorney Benjamin Brafman stood in front of a Brooklyn jury and presented an unusual argument. In white-collar trials, which this was, defense lawyers often do their best to portray their clients—typically wealthy executives from companies or industries that may not be known for high ethical standards—as generous folk who go to church and coach children’s soccer leagues, gentle-hearted people who happen to drive Porsches. In this case, though, Brafman was representing Martin Shkreli, the notorious hedge-fund manager and drug-company entrepreneur, and such an argument wasn’t an option. Instead, Brafman tried to build a case around Shkreli’s greatest potential liability, one that Shkreli has highlighted live-streaming himself and in interviews—his behavior. “Is he strange? Yes,” Brafman said, of his client, during his opening argument. “Will you find him weird? Yes.” He said that Shkreli had been compared to “Rain Man” for his eccentricity, and finally added, “As Lady Gaga would say, he was born this way.”

Shkreli became the target of public scorn when he was the C.E.O. of Turing Pharmaceuticals, a company he founded. Turing acquired a drug called Daraprim, which treats a rare but potentially deadly parasitic infection often suffered by H.I.V./ AIDS patients, and then raised the price from $13.50 to seven hundred and fifty dollars per pill. In the politically charged environment of 2015, he proved an irresistible target of outrage. Presidential candidates excoriated him, and members of Congress chastised him at a public hearing. All the while, Shkreli refused to play the role of the contrite capitalist. “I think it should be as high as possible,” he told me, of the price of Daraprim and other rare-disease drugs, when we met a few months ago. “These are people doing God’s work. How could you ever want the company making the cure for your dying kid to not be flush with cash? I meet moms all the time who say, ‘I want you to be the richest man in the world.’ ”

The controversy surrounding drug-price increases isn’t the reason Shkreli is on trial. At the time of the Daraprim scandal, Shkreli was already under federal investigation for entirely different reasons. In late 2015, he was arrested and charged with misappropriating assets from Retrophin, a publicly traded drug company that he was running, and using those assets to conceal investor losses in separate entities, his hedge funds, MSMB Capital L.P. and MSMB Healthcare L.P. Announcing the charges, the former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Robert Capers, said, “Shkreli essentially ran his companies like a Ponzi scheme.” Brafman’s defense seems to be that Shkreli’s investors ultimately ended up making money on their investments, and this should excuse whatever lines he crossed in the process. (In the government’s view, those lines included misleading his investors and taking assets from Retrophin that didn’t belong to him.) During the trial, which continues this week, prosecutors have put one MSMB Capital investor after another on the stand to testify that Shkreli told them things that weren’t true: exaggerating the size of his fund and the returns it was generating, and, eventually, going to extremes to conceal the fact that it had lost most of its value.

According to the testimony of some of his investors, Shkreli finally told them that he was shutting MSMB down and offered them shares in Retrophin, the drug company he was running that had no relationship with MSMB, rather than cash to redeem their shares. Dr. Lindsay Rosenwald, one of those investors, testified that “my choice was the cash”; he never got the cash, though. Instead, Rosenwald said, he and Shkreli reached a settlement in which Rosenwald received eighty thousand shares of Retrophin. In a pattern mirrored by other investors, Rosenwald testified that he came out ahead, financially, in the end, and was able to sell the Retrophin shares for between four hundred thousand and six hundred thousand dollars, a huge increase over his initial hundred-thousand-dollar investment.

This outcome appears to be at the heart of Brafman’s spirited defense of his client, and during cross-examination, he has asked every investor whether they made money or not; many of them have acknowledged that they did. Legally speaking, the argument is absurd; fraud is never justified just because nobody lost money in the end. But whatever the law, if just one juror decides to fixate on the fact that no one was hurt financially, Shkreli could go free. If that unlikely scenario were to occur, it would be a major embarrassment for the government, which is already under intense criticism for its inability, or unwillingness, to prosecute high-level financial crime, let alone the easier-pickings type that the Shkreli case represents. (For more on this, see Jesse Eisinger’s new book, “ The Chickenshit Club .”)

Shkreli behaved bizarrely during the early days of the trial, at one point bursting into the overflow courtroom where reporters were watching the proceedings on closed-circuit TV. He insulted the prosecutors, calling them “the junior varsity,” and complained that he was being blamed for all the ills of capitalism. In the evenings, he’s been live-broadcasting himself on Facebook. It appeared as if he was intentionally trying to sabotage his trial, and since then, the judge has forbidden him from talking to the press in the environs of the courthouse. Now the thirty-four-year-old Shkreli can be seen sitting quietly at the defense table, as pale and thin as a boy, as his former investors testify against him.

When I spoke to him a few months back, Shkreli seemed to be in denial about the legal peril he faced—if convicted, his potential sentence is estimated to be up to twenty years. He was anxious about his prospects, but he also expressed unwavering optimism that he would be acquitted. He told the story of his parents, immigrants from Albania and Croatia who lived in a rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn and toiled in low-wage jobs. He talked about how hard they worked just to pay their bills and give their children the opportunity to become successful, and how, in light of all he had achieved professionally, he was the pride of his family. “America’s the land of opportunity,” Shkreli told me. “You know, part of being American is that brash, money-making thing.” He went on, “I think people sign up for a Lotto when they come to America. They say, ‘I’m from a shitbird country and I’ll come here, and my dream is that one of us becomes rich, and one of us gets to stick it to the man. One of us is gonna kill it in this country.’ ”"

Trump on Monday by responding to a question about the billionaire with a baffling array of long words.

Speaking to a television interviewer in London, Hawking called Trump “a demagogue who seems to appeal to the lowest common denominator,” a statement that many Trump supporters believed was intentionally designed to confuse them.

Moments after Hawking made the remark, Google reported a sharp increase in searches for the terms “demagogue,” “denominator,” and “Stephen Hawking.”

“For a so-called genius, this was an epic fail,” Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, said. “If Professor Hawking wants to do some damage, maybe he should try talking in English next time.”

Later in the day, Hawking attempted to clarify his remark about the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee, telling a reporter, “Trump bad man. Real bad man.”"

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) took to the Senate floor today to make an impassioned speech, telling his colleagues, “The dream of keeping poor people from seeing a doctor must never die.”

His eyes welling up with tears, Sen. Cruz said, “I embarked on this crusade with a simple goal: to keep affordable health care out of the reach of ordinary, hard-working Americans. And while this battle was lost, that dream—that precious, cherished dream—will live on.”

Reflecting on the government shutdown and near-default that almost touched off a global financial apocalypse, Sen. Cruz said, “We’ll give it another try in a few weeks.”

Sen. Cruz’s closest ally, Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) also spoke reverently of the shutdown, calling it “the most expensive Civil War reënactment in history.”

“Unfortunately, once again, the wrong side won,” he said.

Over in the House of Representatives, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) congratulated his colleagues on the deal to resolve the shutdown, telling reporters, “This proves that when we work together, we can come up with a totally unsatisfactory solution to a completely unnecessary crisis.”

But the last word belonged to Sen. Cruz, who ended his emotional speech with a quiet benediction: “Goodnight stars. Goodnight air. Goodnight noises everywhere.”
