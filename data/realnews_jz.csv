1,http://www.nbcnews.com/better/business/how-college-students-can-avoid-overdraft-late-fees-ncna774051,nbcnews,How college students (and the rest of us) can avoid overdraft and late fees,[],"As if college isn't expensive enough — and at an average $24,610 for a year at an in-state public college and twice that at a private one — today's college students seem intent on adding substantially to their bills. The culprit? Overdraft and late payment fees. Over four years of school, those charges add another $1,016 for the average student, according to NerdWallet. In total, U.S. college students spend more than $795 million a year on overdraft and late payment fees. And every penny of that spending is unnecessary.

So, if you're sending a child off to school this fall here's what they need to know to keep the money in their bank accounts — where it belongs.

Skip Overdraft “Protection”

Overdraft protection can be a misnomer, says millennial money expert Stephanie O’Connell. Essentially, the ""protection"" is assurance that if you pay for something, your purchase will go through even if the money isn't there. But no one is protecting you from overdraft fees. The average bank overdraft fee is currently $35, at credit unions it's a somewhat more reasonable $27.76, according to to a Bankrate.com survey.

To make matters worse, some financial institutions reorder your day’s transactions from highest to lowest amount (rather than in the time order in which you make them), so that if you do overdraw, you may end up paying more than one fee (once for the high charge if it’s more than your balance, then once for each lower charge after that). This can really add up. “If you got charged three overdraft fees in one day, you’re paying $100,” says O’Connell. “What else would you want to do with $100?”

The fix: Don’t sign up for overdraft protection — and if you’ve already got it, call and opt out. “You could buy a $5 sandwich and wind up with a $35 fee for it,” says NerdWallet personal finance columnist Liz Weston. Opting out means that if you do try to buy something your balance doesn’t cover, your debit card will be declined — but a moment of embarrassment at checkout is likely worth the high-fee alternative. One key thing to remember: If you opt out of overdraft protection and have a credit card, it’s important to make certain you have enough in your checking account every month to pay the credit card bill. If you don’t, your payment will be declined, and a late or missed payment can result in higher fees, interest rates and a lasting impact on your credit score. More on that in a minute.

U.S. college students spend more than $795 million a year on overdraft and late payment fees. And every penny of that spending is unnecessary.

Alerts and Auto-Pay Are Your Friend

Visit your financial institution and credit card company websites, and in the settings sections, turn on as many alerts as you can — for low balances, transactions above X amount, purchases made by phone or online and reminders about payment due dates. It’s also a good idea to sign up for daily account balance reminders so you’re never in the dark about how much you have. The NerdWallet analysis we mentioned before studied overdraft fees and late fees, and those late payments can result in fees and a lower credit score over time. Worst of all, they can turn into skipped payments — which could knock 100 points or more off your credit score, taking up to three years to recover, says Weston.

RELATED: Cosigning a Loan? Your Credit Score Will Drop and You’ll Retire Later

The fix: Set up automatic minimum payments from your checking account to your credit card as well as other bills (health club, car insurance, etc.) you pay on a regular basis. For those credit cards, set an amount you're sure will cover the minimum, then when your bill arrives use that as a nudge to go back and adjust the amount you owe. Each month before your payments are due, set a calendar reminder to check your balance to make sure you have enough to cover it.

Remember: It’s vital to try to pay your card off in full every single month, so don’t charge more than you can afford. Try to minimize the urge to charge by thinking about your long-term goals (a.k.a. spring break or that trip you want to take after graduation rather than today's lunch), says Benjamin Keys, assistant professor at The Wharton School. Getting into credit card debt during college, when you likely don't have much of an income, can mean incurring a mountain of interest. Ask yourself before every purchase: Do I need this? Do I really, really want it?

Students Aren't Given a Banking Break

Finally, when you make your choices about where to bank, keep overall costs — including account maintenance fees — to a minimum. There are plenty of free checking accounts available, Weston notes. Yet, she says, ""colleges often steer [students] to options that might not be the best for them.” Step one to combat this? Be aware that just because something is marketed as a student checking account or a student credit card, that doesn’t necessarily make it the best product for your needs. “A trap people fall into is they take the first account they’re given without actually looking at what the fees are, what the fine print is. What are the terms and conditions?” O’Connell adds.

RELATED: Beware Hidden College Costs: Here’s What Financial Aid Doesn’t Cover

The fix: Compare fees at the brick-and-mortar banks on campus. If you're not satisfied, consider an online financial institution, many of which don’t have fees or account minimums. Personal finance blog PT Money lists some of the best options here. The one thing to watch out for? ATM fees. Yes, you can Venmo your friends and swipe for just about everything else, but if you want to grab cash from a machine that doesn't belong to your bank it can cost $2 to $3 a pop. Be realistic about how often you'll do that and factor the likely monthly ATM fees into your decision.

The Takeaway

Never assume anyone has your best interest at heart. Do your own research on checking accounts and credit cards, and don't be afraid to ask about fees and fine print. Set up alerts and reminders for all your accounts, and schedule automatic minimum payments for credit cards (but try your best to manually pay them off in full every month). Opt out of overdraft protection with your financial institution, but every month before your credit card payment rolls around, make sure your balance is enough to cover it.

2,http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/epa-chief-taps-taxpayer-dollars-weekend-flights-home-n786471,nbcnews,EPA Chief Taps Taxpayer Dollars for Weekend Flights Home,['Associated Press'],"WASHINGTON — Records show the head of the Environmental Protection Agency spent weekends in his home state during his first three months in office, frequently flying to and from Oklahoma at taxpayer's expense.

EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's expense reports from March, April and May were released following a Freedom of Information request filed by Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit watchdog group.

The records show Pruitt traveled home at least 10 times, typically leaving Washington on Fridays and returning on Mondays. Pruitt was either in Oklahoma or on trips that included stops there for nearly half the days encompassed in the three-month period, costing more than $15,000.

EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman did not respond to emails or phone messages from The Associated Press on Monday seeking comment.

Pruitt, a Republican, served as Oklahoma's attorney general prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump to lead EPA. Married with two children, Pruitt owns a home in Tulsa, Oklahoma. There were a couple of occasions where Pruitt traveled on a trip for EPA and then paid out-of-pocket to fly to Tulsa before returning to Washington at government expense.

AP reported earlier this year that while Pruitt was in his state job, he was in frequent contact with political donors, corporate executives and industry groups opposed to new environmental regulations enacted under the Obama administration.

He appears to have continued that practice since coming to EPA, including traveling to accept an award from the Oklahoma Well Strippers Association, making a keynote address to a meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council and delivering a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers.

EPA records indicate Pruitt also attended ""informational meetings"" during the trips, which were first reported by The New York Times. Though a trip to Oklahoma might last three or five days, it was not unusual for only one such meeting to be listed during Pruitt's time away from Washington.

An example is Pruitt's reported trip to Tulsa on Friday, May 19, on a flight scheduled to depart Washington at 5:37 p.m. The listed purpose of the trip was an ""informational meeting"" at the Brainerd Chemical Company in Tulsa. Pruitt's return flight to Washington was scheduled to depart the following Monday morning at 6 a.m. local time.

Records show EPA paid $1,980 for Pruitt's roundtrip ticket on a commercial airline, well in excess of what an economy class ticket typically costs on that route. Federal regulations allow government travelers to fly business class or first class only when no cheaper options are ""reasonably available."" Pruitt was also reimbursed $127 for meals and expenses, according to the records.

Among the questions to which Bowman did not respond was whether EPA staff or members of Pruitt's full-time security detail traveled with him. She also did not answer questions about the official purpose of specific trips or whether Pruitt flew first class.

A call to the family-owned distribution company's chairman, Mat Brainerd, was not immediately returned. He testified before congressional panels in favor of extending the Keystone XL oil pipeline and against part of the Clean Air Act.

In a statement to the Times, Bowman said: ""The administrator's travel, whether to Utah, Michigan or Oklahoma, all serves the purpose of hearing from hard-working Americans about how EPA can better serve the American people.""

On a different May trip, records show Pruitt flew to Colorado to give a speech to the Heritage Foundation before buying his own ticket to Tulsa for the weekend and then returning to Washington. On that trip, EPA paid $2,690 in commercial airfare.

The Heritage Foundation, a free-market think tank that receives funding from groups tied to the fossil-fuel industry, paid for Pruitt's hotel room in Colorado Springs, according to his travel form. Though Pruitt's expense report indicates an ""ethics form is prepared"" to allow the outside group to pick up his hotel tab, a copy of that form was not provided by the EPA.

Eric Schaeffer, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, said the records obtained by his group reflect Pruitt's priorities.

""These travel records show that Administrator Pruitt is more focused on cultivating his relationships with industry and conservative political organizations in his home state of Oklahoma than he is on protecting the environment and the public health for the rest of America,"" said Schaeffer, who served as the head of EPA's office of civil enforcement from 1997 to 2002."

The suspect, James Matthew Bradley Jr., 60, of Clearwater, Fla., appeared briefly in court Monday morning, hours after officials announced that a 10th victim in the case had died.

Bradley was taken into custody after authorities made a gruesome discovery over the weekend: dozens of suspected migrants crammed into the back of an overcrowded, sweltering 18-wheeler in a San Antonio, Texas, parking lot.

Initially, eight were dead inside the overheated trailer when authorities found them, and more than a dozen others were suffering from life-threatening injuries. The two additional deaths happened at the hospital, authorities said.

The disturbing scene unfolded in the late hours of Saturday night and early hours of Sunday morning when an unidentified tipster, who had been in the truck, approached a Walmart security guard and asked for water, San Antonio Police Chief William McManus told reporters, describing it as a ""horrific tragedy.""

Bradley is charged with one count of transporting undocumented immmigrants ""for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain to wit,"" a federal criminal complaint filed Monday morning says.

According to the complaint, Bradley told San Antonio police officers he was driving from Schaller, Iowa, to Brownsville, Texas, to deliver his trailer to a new owner after his boss sold it and asked him to deliver it.

Bradley said he had no idea what was inside the truck until he took a bathroom break and heard movement inside.

He ""stated when he arrived at the Walmart he exited the vehicle to urinate and he heard banging and shaking in the trailer,"" according to the complaint. ""Bradley said he went to open the doors and was surprised when he was run over by 'Spanish' people and knocked to the ground. Bradley said he then noticed bodies just lying on the floor like meat.""

Aware that the refrigeration system wasn't working, he then went back to the tractor to call his wife, but did not call 911, the complaint says.

About three dozen people were in or around the truck when first responders arrived. Fire Chief Charles Hood told reporters Sunday that those inside were ""very hot to the touch.""

""Our paramedics and firefighters found that each one of them had heart rates over about 130 beats per minute,"" he said. ""You're looking at a lot of heat stroke, a lot of dehydration.""

Brian Pyle, the owner of the Iowa-based company advertised on the side of the truck, Pyle Transportation, told NBC News he had sold the truck in May.

“I had nothing to do with anything that guy did,” Pyle said. “I had no connection, had no idea what he was doing. I feel bad for what happened down there. I’m sorry for everything that happened. I found out about it on the news like everyone else.”

It was not immediately clear where the victims were from, but Mexico's consul general, Rayna Torres, confirmed Sunday that Mexican nationals were among them. The Guatemalan Foreign Ministry said Monday that two of the hospitalized migrants — ages 17 and 23 — were from Guatemala. They are in stable condition. At least one of the deceased was also from that country, the Foreign Ministry said.

The Department of Homeland Security was working with local police in the case. Homeland security agents interviewed one of the undocumented immigrants at the hospital, who told them he came from Aguascalientes, Mexico, and was supposed to pay smugglers $5,500 once he reached San Antonio, according to the complaint.

The migrant detailed a long journey involving crossing the Rio Grande River into the U.S. by raft, walking for a day, getting picked up by a Chevrolet Silverado, and then being thrown into the pitch-black trailer where he was discovered with no water or food.

""During the first hour of transportation, everyone seemed to be ok. Later, people started having trouble breathing and some started to pass out. People began hitting the trailer walls and making noise to get the driver's attention. The driver never stopped,"" the complaint says.

Adan Lalravega, a 27-year-old laborer from Aguascalientes, told the Associated Press that he lost consciousness amid the sounds of whimpering children and pleas for water. When Lalravega awoke he was in a San Antonio hospital bed.

Officials believe up to 200 migrants may have been transported at different times as part of the operation.

""To maximize their criminal profits, these human smugglers crammed more than 100 people into a tractor trailer in the stifling Texas summer heat resulting in ten dead and 29 others hospitalized,"" Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Thomas Homan said in a press release from the U.S. attorney's office for Western Texas.

Bradley's next court appearance is set for Thursday. He has requested a court-appointed attorney.

Obdulia Sánchez, 18, was booked into the Merced County Jail on suspicion of DUI and gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated after Friday's crash, according to the California Highway Patrol.

Sánchez was behind the wheel of a 2003 Buick when the vehicle veered onto the right shoulder of the road, according to the California Highway Patrol. Police said it is unclear how fast Sánchez was driving.

She over-corrected, causing the vehicle to swerve across lanes, crash through a wire fence and overturn into a field, the authorities said.

The two 14-year-olds were not wearing seat belts and were ejected from the car during the crash, officials said.

In a statement, the California Highway Patrol said it is aware of the possibility of ""video evidence located on social media"" and is investigating.

Part of the livestream shows Sánchez outside the car with what appears to be her sister Jacqueline’s body. The other teen can be seen attempting to wave down help.

Sergio Ramos Estrada, a cousin, told NBC News the teens were preparing for a Quinceañera — a special 15th-birthday celebration — when the accident happened.

“We were going to go to her house the next day to celebrate her Quinceañera and unfortunately that happened,” Ramos Estrada said. The CHP is examining the video as part of the investigation.

Sánchez is currently being held on a $300,000 bond at the John Latoracca Correctional Facility in Merced.

Mary Hernandez, 25, was following Sánchez on Instagram and watched as the livestream showed the car careen into the fence.

Disturbed by what she saw, Hernandez said she recorded a copy of the video.

“There are so many people that are on my Snapchat that I see driving on their phone,” Hernandez told NBC News over the phone. “I hope that this video makes people think twice about what they’re doing in their car.”

“This is real,” she said. “This is something that could seriously happen to someone.""

In an email to NBC News, an Instagram spokesperson said the platform is working to improve its live video feature.

“We're deeply saddened by this tragedy,"" the statement says. ""We urge people to use our reporting tools if they see any content or behavior that puts anyone's safety at risk. We want to interrupt these streams as quickly as possible when they're reported to us, and we will also notify law enforcement if we see a threat that requires an immediate response. We suggest people contact emergency services if they become aware of a situation where the authorities can help.”

The spokesperson declined to specify how long the video was accessible on the site.

Social media sites such as Instagram and Facebook have faced a host of violent or disturbing postings since users were given the ability to livestream.

In April, Steve Stephens shot and killed grandfather Robert Godwin Sr. while broadcasting the moment on Facebook Live. He had also broadcasted his intent to commit the crime on Facebook moments before. Stephens later killed himself following a police chase.

After questions about the livestreams circulated, Facebook's Vice President of Global Operations, Justin Osofsky wrote in a blogpost that the platform, which owns Instagram, was reviewing its reporting system for videos that violate its standards.

""We disabled the suspect’s account within 23 minutes of receiving the first report about the murder video, and two hours after receiving a report of any kind. But we know we need to do better,"" Osofsky wrote.

A 15-year-old Chicago girl was allegedly gang raped during a Facebook Live broadcast in March, and the stream was watched by at least 40 people, according to police.

In January, four Chicago teens were accused of beating and torturing a bound and gagged man with mental health challenges while streaming on Facebook Live.

After the four suspects had been arrested on unrelated battery charges, investigators were able to connect the two incidents through the Facebook Live video.

Also in January, 14-year-old Naika Venant spent nearly three hours broadcasting herself on Facebook Live in the bathroom of her foster parent’s home before she killed herself."

10,http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/umbilical-cord-compound-boosts-brain-power-mice-n748846,nbcnews,Umbilical Cord Compound Boosts Brain Power in Mice,['Maggie Fox'],"A protein in human umbilical cord blood seems to rejuvenate the brains of old mice, researchers reported this week.

Researchers think it’s worth testing more, along with hundreds of other compounds that babies make in abundance and that adult bodies seem to barely make at all.

A protein from human umbilical cord blood seemed to charge up old mice TIGM file

The protein is called TIMP2, and it’s just one of many that the team at Stanford University and a spinoff company called Alkahest want to investigate.

There are lots of caveats. The mice were genetically engineered, it’s not clear why this protein falls off as people get older and it’s not clear how it works in the brain.

But old mice infused with the compound learned a little faster and better, the team reported in the journal Nature.

“It’s regulating a lot of different biological processes.”

The discovery started with an experiment dating back to 2014, when Tony Wyss-Coray, a professor of neurology at Stanford, and colleagues found that transfusing blood from young mice into old mice perked up the older mice, boosting both muscle strength and memory.

“It was all mouse to mouse. The first question is do humans have similar factors and do they change with age?” Wyss-Coray asked.

Related: Young Blood Gives Zip to Old Mice

So they tried a new experiment, taking serum — the liquid part of blood — from human umbilical cords, and infusing it into genetically engineered mice that could handle human blood.

The mice learned faster and their brains changed, producing more brain cells, Wyss-Coray and colleagues reported.

“Here we show that human cord plasma treatment revitalizes the hippocampus and improves cognitive function in aged mice,” they wrote in this week’s report in Nature.

But what component of the serum was doing it? They screened the blood for compounds that could be found in high levels in baby blood but that fell as people got older.

“We have now measured well over 1,000 different factors in blood and roughly one third of those change between young people and old people,” Wyss-Coray told NBC News.

They settled first on TIMP2. When infused into mice, it made them learn faster and better but when they dissected the mice, they couldn’t see any brain changes. So they know there must be other compounds in human plasma that affect the brain.

The hope, of course, is to find a cocktail of factors that will rejuvenate the brain without causing cancer or badly affecting other tissues in the body. It's not practical to do large-scale blood transfusions, even if they could be shown to help — which they haven't been.

TIMP2 had not been linked with memory before. “We just saw that it decreases in blood very quickly from age 0 to 20 — a 50 percent drop. It’s possible that in the brain the levels are actually high and they decline much slower,” Wyss-Coray said.

“It’s regulating a lot of different biological processes. Because it has broad effects, we may actually have a more powerful factor.” If a compound could keep the brain and the body young, that would be a slam-dunk for aging science.

The science is in very early stages now. Wyss-Coray says they’ll now study TIMP2 in animals bred to imitate the effects of human brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s.

“We want to understand how these factors work. We want to understand where they come from,” he said.

“We will test this in models of neurodegeneration and understand how it works,” he said. “Commercially, the company is trying to first validating the findings that we have found in the lab and then seeing if this is a treatment we can go forward with.”

They’re also studying broader approaches, including the idea of infusing young blood into old people.

Wyss-Coray’s company has finished a small, safety study of the approach in people and is preparing results for release."

Liz Wagner reports on a story that first aired on July 25. (Published Tuesday, July 25, 2017)

A young Oakland man arrested last year on terrorism-related charges conspired to kill 10,000 people across the Bay Area by blowing up gay clubs in San Francisco, planting backpack bombs on the University of California, Berkeley campus, setting fire to the Berkeley Hills and selling cocaine laced with rat poison, according federal court records obtained by NBC Bay Area.

NBC Bay Area’s Investigative Unit first broke the news that Berkeley High School graduate Amer Sinan Alhaggagi, 22, was indicted late last week for attempting to provide support to the terrorist group ISIS.

During a December detention hearing, federal prosecutors recounted in detail conversations dating back to last July that Alhaggagi had with FBI informants posing as ISIS sympathizers.

“I live close to San Francisco, that’s like the gay capital of the world,” Alhaggagi allegedly told an FBI informant during an online conversation. “I’m going to handle them right. LOL. I’m going to plant a bomb in a gay club. By god, I’m going to tear up the city. The whole Bay Area is going up in flames. My ideas are genius.”

Oakland Man Indicted for Attempting to Help ISIS

An East Bay man has been indicted on terrorism-related charges, federal court records show. Liz Wagner reports in a video that aired on July 22, 2017. Published Monday, July 24, 2017 (Published Monday, July 24, 2017)

But Alhaggagi’s attorney at the time argued his client never actually intended to commit those atrocities.

“The real ultimate issue is how much of these allegations are very stupid and very inappropriate and very disturbing puffery, and how much was intended to be acted out,” Federal defender Hanni Fakhoury said during the hearing.

Prosecutors say Alhaggagi’s actions went beyond “puffery.”

Video Oakland Man Indicted for Attempting to Help ISIS

During the detention hearing, they said Alhaggagi met face-to-face with an undercover FBI agent posing as an ISIS sympathizer, taking him on a tour of the Bay Area and pointing out possible targets for an attack. He also provided three backpacks that could be used to carry bombs to the undercover agent, according to federal prosecutors.

When federal agents served a search warrant at Alhaggagi’s residence, prosecutors say they found a bomb making manual on the desktop of his computer.

At one point, prosecutors say Alhaggagi even asked an undercover agent if he should kill his own friends.

“Do you think I should kill my non-believer friends?” Alhaggagi allegedly said. “That’s like sending an all-out statement that no one is safe. I’ll just call them over and tie them up and execute them.”

According to prosecutors, Alhaggagi planned to flee to Mexico after carrying out those attacks. From there, prosecutors say he planned to join Islamic State fighters abroad.

Despite those disturbing conversations, Fakhoury said his client’s actions tell a different story.

When prosecutors brought up a trip to Saudi Arabia they found concerning, Fakhoury said Alhaggagi was merely attending his sister’s wedding. Prosecutors alleged Alhaggagi told an undercover agent he’d purchased rat poison using stolen credit cards, but Fakhoury said federal agents never found evidence that actually took place. When prosecutors claimed Alhaggagi intended to use stolen credit cards to purchase materials for terror attacks, Fakhoury said the only items his client actually bought with those stolen cards were clothing from an online retailer.

“There’s a disconnect between his words and actions,” Fakhoury said.

During the hearing, federal prosecutors discussed how they were able to track the disturbing online comments to Alhaggagi.

Initially, undercover agents in communication with Alhaggagi were unaware of his true identity or where he lived. However, remarks about wanting to set fire to the Berkeley Hills gave investigators their first clue Alhaggagi lived in the Bay Area. When Alhaggagi allegedly claimed he would join a local police department to steal weapons if he couldn’t make bombs himself, investigators began contacting Bay Area law enforcement agencies. They eventually found an application Alhaggagi submitted to the Oakland Police Department. When an undercover agent met with Alhaggagi for the first time, they confirmed he was their suspect.

But a few months later, prosecutors say Alhaggagi cut off communication with those undercover agents. Agents ultimately arrested him on identity theft and fraud charges relating to the online clothing purchase he made using a stolen credit card. They eventually added the charge of providing support to a foreign terrorist organization.

Alhaggagi’s family said in a written statement given to NBC Bay Area that he loved this country and never intended to carry out a violent attack.

“We were shocked to learn of the accusations involving Amer. Amer is not and has never been radicalized in any way. He grew up in this country and loves it here. He is peaceful and kind. He was very young and immature when he got involved in the online conversations that are the basis for these accusations. He did not think those conversations were serious and he never had any intent to harm anyone. We love him and continue to fully support him.”

Alhaggagi’s arraignment has not yet been scheduled. NBC Bay Area will continue to follow the story and provide updates as more information becomes public."

The bilateral talks were aimed at confirming close cooperation among the United States, Japan and South Korea before a Group of 20 summit meeting to be held in Hamburg, Germany, later this week, the White House said in a statement.

The two leaders stressed that their countries are ""ready to defend and respond to any threat or action taken by North Korea,"" according to the statement.

Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Koichi Hagiuda told the Japanese news agency Kyodo, meanwhile, that Abe praised Trump for sanctions the United States imposed last week on a Chinese bank and individuals accused of laundering money for North Korea.

Trump, who met with Xi in April in Florida, has said he is willing to work with China on trade issues but wants to see Beijing use its economic leverage to force North Korea to scale back its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, which are a threat to the United States, South Korea and Japan.

But Trump has become frustrated that China hasn't done more to pressure Pyongyang, and he has been considering moving ahead on trade actions.

Schecter', 'Hannah Rappleye']","PALM BEACH COUNTY, Florida — For the first responders who found her lifeless body one October morning, 24-year-old Alison Flory was yet another casualty of addiction here on the front line of Florida's opioid crisis.

To her family, she was a daughter, a beloved sister, a goofy bookworm who made them laugh and a young woman they desperately hoped would get help. She had arrived in South Florida from Illinois just more than a year before she died, seeking treatment for her addiction. Her parents believe it is that treatment, paid for by her family's excellent insurance, that ultimately got her killed.

Palm Beach County can feel like paradise. The ocean laps on soft-sand beaches and the wind rustles through tall palms. Maseratis cruise the roads and mansions rise behind gilded gates. On the wealthiest stretch of waterfront sits Mar-a-Lago, President Trump's winter White House. In its backyard is one of the rehab capitals of America.

Thousands of addicts arrive here each year from Ohio and West Virginia, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, hoping that at one of South Florida's many drug treatment centers, they'll find recovery. And some do.

But an investigation by NBC News has found that many of these vulnerable patients have become grist in an insurance fraud mill. Crooked treatment centers partner with ""body brokers"" and operators of so-called ""sober homes"" to find patients with good health insurance. Brokers and sober home owners offer those trying to get clean free rent and grocery store gift cards, cigarettes and manicures in exchange for going to a specific treatment center, which pays kickbacks for every client.

Once they've reeled patients in, these treatment centers bill their insurance tens of thousands of dollars for often questionable counseling, costly and potentially unnecessary drug screens, and exotic laboratory tests. Some treatment centers not only overlook drug use — they encourage it. To Florida's worst operators, relapse doesn't mean failure. It means profit.

""This is an entire industry that's been corrupted by easy money,"" said Palm Beach County's top prosecutor, State Attorney Dave Aronberg. ""Unscrupulous actors have taken advantage of well-intended federal law, and a lack of any good law at the state level, to profit off people at the lowest stages of their lives.""

That law is the Affordable Care Act, which along with the federal Mental Health Parity Act passed in 2008, was meant to ensure people suffering from addiction could get the care they needed. Together they required insurers to cover substance abuse treatment, barred companies from rejecting those with preexisting conditions, and allowed young people to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26. But this broader coverage met with little oversight.

Those looking to make cash found the country's opioid epidemic had provided them with a trove of desperate people, many young and hooked on pills or heroin, and access to a deep pool of insurance dollars. Everyone got in on the business. Substance abuse treatment in Palm Beach County used to consist largely of a scrappy network of treatment centers and sober homes that just scraped by. In the past few years it's become a $1 billion business, according to the Palm Beach Post's calculations.

""It's a total scam,"" said Aronberg. ""Not only are taxpayers footing the bill, but people are dying unnecessarily because of this.""

The scammers have made it difficult for the ethical, and sorely needed, treatment centers and sober homes to survive, said John Lehman, the director of the Florida Association of Recovery Residences, an industry group that oversees sober homes.

""The broad brush of bad actions and illegal activity is painting across everybody,"" said Lehman. ""So the good guys are having trouble keeping their beds full. And the bad guys are saying you want to shoot dope in the bathroom, go ahead.""

Three Moms Send Their Daughters to Florida

Alison Flory was a teenager who loved to be in love. She loved trips to the bookstore in Sugar Grove, a Chicago suburb, Star Wars, ice cream, and when she was 17, she fell for a boy. He was artsy, and moody, and loved her back, so much that when she said she wanted to break up, he threatened to kill himself. Her mother thought it was teenage stuff. ""I said, 'That's ridiculous,'"" Jennifer Flory said.

He called Alison one night after they split. She didn't answer. On the voicemail, she could hear as he jumped in front of a train. Alison was beside him at the hospital when he died.

""She felt like it was her fault,"" said Flory. ""I felt like it was my fault. We all felt like it was our fault.""

Alison started with prescription pills to dull the pain. Her parents read the signs — moodiness, languishing in bed — as grief. And they were. But she was also sinking into substance abuse. Flory's smart, ambitious daughter made it less than a year through college, dropped out, and sank deeper. She did a month of rehab in Illinois, and Flory thought she'd get her smiling daughter back. But when Alison got out, her parents said a boy Alison met in rehab introduced her to heroin. Jennifer didn't know exactly what was wrong with her daughter. In 2015, when Alison was 23, Flory knew she needed help.

That was the same year that Michelle Curran decided that rehab was going to be the difference between life and death for her daughter, Mikaya Feucht. Mikaya first used pills after a surgery while she was still in high school outside of Columbus, Ohio, a state that routinely leads the nation in deadly overdoses. By the time Feucht was 23, she had two little boys she loved fiercely, but the pull of heroin threatened to tear them apart.

Across the state in Troy, Sandra Hinkle was at work as a 911 dispatcher the day in April 2015 when the call came in that her 22-year-old daughter Kaitlyn Cruea had overdosed on heroin. Cruea had a little boy, too. Hinkle wanted Cruea to live to see her son Karter grow up. To get her well, Hinkle felt she had to get her daughter out of town.

These mothers discovered that Florida was happy to help. They found the state's flourishing recovery industry through an internet search, word of mouth, and the help of an Illinois man working as a marketer for a Florida treatment center. Their daughters each started at a different treatment center, but the pattern is the same.

Someone checked their insurance, asked a few questions, bought their daughters a plane ticket to South Florida — a potentially illegal marketing practice. The mothers were told their insurance would cover the care and that everything was going to be okay.

“ I felt like it was my fault. We all felt like it was our fault.”

""I felt hopeful, more than I had ever felt,"" said Jennifer Flory. ""I didn't know. I thought going to this treatment program was going somewhere special.""

Within a few months, each mother began to suspect something was wrong. Their daughters would call every few weeks to tell them they had moved to a new sober home. And when they did, the names of the treatment centers on the bills that kept arriving changed too.

Envelopes from their insurance company arrived almost daily, detailing thousands of dollars in treatment and thousands more in laboratory tests. There were bills from chiropractors and bills from counselors and bills for DNA testing.

Dizzied, the mothers tried to track from afar where their daughters were and who was helping them get sober. Sometimes, when they called, a counselor on the other end of the line would offer updates, or explain charges. Others never even picked up.

As their girls hopped from house to house, the envelopes from the insurance companies mounted. But the mothers didn't realize the scope of the problem, because no one ever came to collect. Treatment centers routinely, and illegally, waive co-pays and deductibles, according to prosecutors, telling patients and parents insurance covers everything.

Treatment centers and labs rack up sky-high bills, sometimes collecting only a fraction of the money charged for a $5,000 urine test or a $1,800 counseling session. What they don't get paid, they write off, said Aronberg. Flory, Curran and Hinkle said they never got calls from debt collectors, so it took time to realize what was unfolding.

Curran's insurance would be charged more than $600,000 by the seven treatment centers Mikaya attended between January and June of 2016. Flory's was charged about $1.2 million during the 15 months Alison bounced between nine different facilities in South Florida. At least three of the facilities the girls attended have been raided by law enforcement and shuttered. All of the facilities declined requests for comment by NBC News.

Hinkle hasn't tallied up everything yet, but she keeps coming back to that one month when she said she got billed for more than 172 different charges.

""How did I not see this? I should have known,"" said Hinkle. ""You just want to believe they're in the right place, that they're getting the help that you sent them for.""

How the Florida Model Was Born

In 2015, the year these mothers first sought help, nearly 52,500 people lost their lives to an overdose in the U.S, up nearly 40 percent from 2010. About 33,000 of those deaths were due to opioids, more than any year on record. Overdoses now kill more people than car accidents, more than guns.

Treatment is not always within reach. Waitlists for beds at state-run facilities across the country can run weeks or months. Many private rehabs don't take insurance, and their fees can run $10,000 or more a month.

For these problems, the Sunshine State had an answer.

The ""Florida model"" was born with good intentions. In a traditional, 28-day inpatient program, patients are cloistered, then return to the community.

Alison Flory overdosed and died at this sober home in 2016 NBC News

In many South Florida programs, clients first attend inpatient detox, then do more intensive rehab and outpatient treatment while living in the community. The idea was that this would better develop their ability to live on their own. It also kept costs lower, so some insurance companies would cover treatment longer.

""Sober homes"" became key to this model. Patients would pay rent to live in the group homes, sleeping and eating there, then report to nearby drug treatment centers staffed with counselors and doctors. At their best, these homes provide structure, rules and a community to lean on in the early stages of recovery. But unscrupulous operators began to realize these homes could be a way to reel in vulnerable addicts.

Some sober homes offered addicts free or discounted rent, cash, and other perks in exchange for attending a specific treatment center, which law enforcement officials said violates Florida laws barring kickbacks and insurance fraud. Those in the shuffle are more blunt.

""It's like hustling humans,"" said Drew, a 21-year-old from West Virginia who was living in a sober home in Delray Beach last February. ""They'll take extra insurance money and pay you to live there and just let you get high because the owner's making bank.""

Delray Beach Mayor Cary Glickstein estimates that his city of 66,000 has about 700 sober homes that house up to 7,000 people in recovery. Nearby Lake Worth, Boynton Beach and West Palm Beach likely hold hundreds more. Exactly how many is hard to know, because sober homes operate without any kind of oversight — and the bad homes, he said, are crowding out the good.

""These kids are just cycled through different houses,"" said Glickstein. ""There's no supervision. Many times they're supervised by convicted felons, people that are trafficking drugs while they're supposed to be supervising kids in recovery.""

This is an unintended consequence of federal disability and housing laws that bar municipalities from discriminating against those with physical or mental disabilities, including addiction. Cities that have tried to limit sober homes have been successfully sued for discrimination. But because the treatment isn't technically being provided within the homes, they can't regulate them as they would drug treatment centers either.

Within these homes, people are dying. Palm Beach County's overdose deaths have quadrupled in the past four years, hitting almost 600 in 2016, as the number of treatment centers and sober homes has grown. The rise of the synthetic opioid fentanyl is exacerbating the problem, making batches of heroin stronger, and more deadly.

""It's a tragedy on so many levels,"" said Glickstein. ""The desperate parents in Ohio and Kentucky and Michigan that are being lured through deceptive websites with palm trees have no idea what their kids are getting into when they get down here.""

MIkaya Feucht and her children. Michelle Curran

Palm Beach County has started to crack down. Last year it launched a task force, headed up by State Attorney Aronberg, which has made 30 arrests for so-called ""patient brokering"" since last July.

In May, Gov. Rick Scott officially declared Florida's opioid crisis a state of emergency. Legislators recently passed a bill that would increase penalties for brokering. It will give prosecutors sharper tools to crack down on what a grand jury last December found was rampant brokering and fraud across the industry.

""The legitimate players, the good guys, are far outweighed by the corrupt,"" said Aronberg. ""This is not a case where a few bad apples spoil the whole bunch. This is a case where most of the apples are spoiled.""

Among those to see gold in addiction was a man who became one of South Florida's most notorious treatment center owners. All three of the girls from the Midwest, Alison, Mikaya and Kaitlyn, would get wrapped up in his network. His name was Kenneth Chatman.

'He Sees A Dollar Sign'

Rehab was not the first way Chatman tried to make a buck in Florida. In 2008, Chatman, a transplant from New York, pleaded guilty to federal charges for running a credit card fraud scheme. After that, he founded a car dealership that didn't go far. Then he had a gym, where, according to an account he posted online, he got interested in the journey to recovery.

In 2012, while he was still on federal probation, he became what's known in South Florida as a ""body broker."" He rented houses in the area and began to operate them as sober homes under the name Stay'n Alive. He stepped into a game already hot throughout South Florida. He partnered with local drug treatment centers, offering to send them his residents in exchange for kickbacks.

More than 100 pages of police reports obtained by NBC News through an open records request show that his homes were chaotic from their earliest days. One address was visited by the police 15 times in a year.

Sometimes Chatman called the cops to deal with an unruly resident. Sometimes the residents called to complain about Chatman — for kicking them out, refusing to give them back a phone, or in one woman's case, trying to block her from leaving.

There were also rumors of Chatman trafficking his female clients. In 2013, a woman reported that her god-daughter was living in one of Chatman's houses. She told police he had called her to demand money, and that she had heard Chatman was prostituting women under his care.

In 2017, he would plead guilty to a multi-million dollar conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud, and to sex trafficking, for prostituting his female clients.

But at the time, those rumors didn't hinder him. In fact, Chatman worked his way up from brokering patients out of his sober homes to running the drug treatment centers themselves.

In Florida, nearly anyone can open a treatment center, as long as they have a little cash, find a doctor to write prescriptions, and a clinical director to oversee treatment. The exceptions are those, like Chatman, with felony convictions. To dodge that, his wife, Laura, became the official owner. Reflections Treatment Center launched in late 2013.

The empire rose quickly. One arm of it oversaw the sober homes, some of which Chatman continued to run himself. He also recruited a network of other homes to funnel bodies to his treatment center. He has since admitted to giving $500-a-week kickbacks to sober home operators who brought him insured clients. All told, court papers show Chatman paid out at least $640,000 to three sober home operators who sent people his way.

In exchange for free rent, addicts boarded vans — ""druggie buggies"" as locals call them — three to six mornings a week, bound for Reflections. Chatman, fit and nattily dressed, put up a good front. He posted videos of success stories, and made a brand of t-shirts his clients wore that read DOPELESS HOPE FIEND.

But behind the blackened windows of the treatment center in a Margate, Florida strip mall, former clients and employees said treatment wasn't the priority.

""I walked right into the group room and I could easily spot that at least 90 percent were getting high,"" said Jack, who attended Reflections in 2015. He said Chatman made it clear clients could use as long as he could bill their insurance. ""When he looks at a client, he doesn't see a human being,"" said Jack. ""He sees a dollar sign.""

But the real dollars didn't come from sitting kids down for treatment. It was in getting them to pee in a cup.

A $10,600 Bill for a Drug Test

In the spring of 2016, the incessant bills Michelle Curran received in the mail began to make her wonder. She called her insurance company, Cigna, but she said no one ever called her back. (Cigna said it could not comment directly on Curran's case for privacy reasons, but said it has since contacted Curran and is addressing fraud issues in Florida).

One day on the phone with her daughter Mikaya Feucht, Curran started to try to get to the bottom of things.

Mikaya Feucht died of an overdose after six months in at least seven rehabs in South Florida, including Reflections, a facility whose owner has pleaded guilty to health care fraud and sex trafficking. Her mother, Michelle Curran, provided NBC News with a copy of a bill showing the total charges submitted to Mikaya's insurer, Cigna.

""I'm like, 'I didn't know you saw your therapist every single day,'"" Curran remembered. Feucht said she most certainly did not. ""So I said, 'Are they doing drug tests every day too? I have a bill here for $10,600."" And she goes, 'Mom, I've' — and these were her words — 'I've peed in a cup twice this week.'""

Random drug screens have long been a key piece of recovery. Treatment centers and sober homes used to depend on dipstick tests, the kind anyone can do, which can run as low as $5 apiece. If staffers got what they thought was a false result, they'd send it over to a lab for ""confirmatory"" tests to make sure the results were right.

Chatman was among a group of treatment center operators who realized laboratories could become the financial fuel of the rehab industry.

They made deals with labs, or started up their own, so they could take a slice of every test billed. Particularly lucrative were young people from out of state like Feucht, Flory and Cruea, because their insurance could be charged at sky-high out-of-network rates. One tally by an industry group found 75 percent of the young people in treatment in Florida are from out of state.

Doctors at treatment centers would put in ""standing orders"" for near-daily drug screens, along with genetic and allergy tests that could run thousands of dollars.

Mikaya Feucht's mother, Michelle Curran NBC News

To maximize profits, some treatment centers retest samples or double-test patients. When Chatman didn't have enough clients in treatment to hit his lab numbers, he had employees submit their own saliva and urine to keep the money flowing, according to court documents.

Chatman teamed up with at least five different labs, according to the federal indictment filed against him in 2016. Kickbacks were so common that he allegedly complained to one laboratory rep when he wasn't offered money or wined and dined.

One unnamed lab wrote Chatman at least $160,000 in kickback checks between December 2014 and May 2015, court papers show. Another allegedly had a driver go to the Florida Keys to cash checks and deliver thousands of dollars to Chatman each week.

“ I've peed in a cup twice this week.”

Chatman went to great lengths to keep a hold on people. Former clients and court documents describe how he nailed the windows of houses shut, and locked them in from the outside. He confiscated and never returned their cell phones. He took their money and then plied them with drugs so they would relapse, trigging another round of insurance-funded treatment.

Curran said that in May 2016, she learned a man named Kenny had allegedly provided her daughter drugs so she would relapse. When Feucht overdosed, he allegedly left her on a sober home lawn for the first responders to find.

When some parents called Reflections to ask about stories they were hearing from their kids, Chatman convinced the parents their kids were lying, according to one former employee, because that's what addicts do. But his most effective tool may have been that he always provided a home of last resort.

""Even though he mistreated a lot of them, he had this hold over them,"" said a woman who worked at Reflections in 2014. ""A lot of people had been cut off by their parents. He always took you back in.""

Former employees said they tried to raise flags. Three said they asked the state's Department of Children and Families, which regulates treatment centers, to do a surprise inspection. In an email sent to DCF in February 2015 and provided to NBC News, one person who had worked there told the agency that despite the fact that Chatman's wife Laura was on the paperwork, Chatman was actually in charge. The email also said patient applications had been forged, and that there were rumors Chatman was prostituting his clients.

DCF told NBC News that the agency did not have authority to screen personnel or spouses not listed in certain leadership roles on licensure applications. The agency did not respond specifically to NBC News' questions about warnings employees said they submitted about Chatman.

Two months later, in April 2015, a woman contacted the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. She told police that Chatman ran flophouses, using one as a ""staging home for women who are addicts,"" according to her account in a police report obtained by NBC News. She charged that he kept her and other women ""in a state of impairment in order to pimp them out,"" placing ads for them on a local escort site.

Local police turned the investigation over to the FBI. Police reports show the agency already had an active investigation going on Chatman.

But that didn't hinder Chatman from growing his business. In September 2015, DCF gave Reflections a permanent license to run both intensive rehab and outpatient treatment. A year later, Laura Chatman applied to open a second treatment center, Journey to Recovery. The application, obtained by NBC News, shows that while the center was opened under Laura's name, Kenny Chatman is listed as a signatory to its bank account. It was approved.

Sam Petulla

The same month, he and Laura bought a $1.1 million home in Reflections' name. Chatman posed for photos at charity events, where he gave away large checks to support kids' football games and unwed mothers.

Chatman relied on this image as a pillar of the community in December, when the Palm Beach Post published a scathing expose, which included details from the report of the woman who said she had been prostituted. Chatman denied everything, telling the paper in a statement, ""I would never, knowingly put any of the clients of Reflections Treatment Center or any other vulnerable young person in harm's way.""

In the wake of Chatman's arrest, DCF said it has accepted the surrender of both licenses for his treatment centers. The agency said it refers complaints that are beyond its authority to law enforcement, and coordinates with those groups to hold individuals accountable. It has also supported recent legislation to beef up standards for substance abuse in the state.

""The alleged practices of those who have been accused of taking advantage of vulnerable individuals are shameful and sickening and DCF has no tolerance for this type of behavior,"" the agency said in a statement.

Chatman's attorney Saam Zanganeh said that his client was a small fish in an industry where fraud and kickbacks run rampant. ""Everybody's looking for a scapegoat,"" Zanganeh said in May, when a judge sentenced Chatman to spend the next 27 years in federal prison. Zanganeh said his client had fully cooperated with federal authorities, and criticized the judge for overruling the ""miraculous"" plea deal of 14 years Zanganeh had negotiated.

Laura Chatman pleaded guilty to two felony counts for letting her husband use her name on the paperwork for the treatment centers they opened. Her attorney, Christopher Lyons of the Miami-based firm Mase Tinelli, said that she had been kept in the dark about her husband's business. ""She is sincerely remorseful for her role in the offense and causing so much pain to the victims and their families,"" he said.

Two sober home operators, a mental health counselor and a doctor have also pleaded to fraud charges. A third doctor has pleaded not guilty, and is taking his case to trial.

The First To Die

Katie Cruea was the first of the three Midwestern girls to move into Chatman's houses, and she was the first to die.

She'd been living in sober homes linked to Chatman for about two months when her mother, Sandra Hinkle, bought her a ticket to come back to Ohio for the holidays. She arrived at noon on Christmas Day 2015, and left a few days before New Year's. At the airport, Cruea begged Hinkle not to make her go back. Hinkle thought her daughter was just getting cold feet, doing that addict thing.

""She said, 'Mom please don't make me go, I'm afraid I'm never going to see you again,'"" Hinkle remembered. ""I gave her a hug, and said 'You will absolutely see me again, I'll never let anything happen to you. I'm your mom.'""

But Hinkle never did see her daughter again. Cruea overdosed on February 24, 2016. She was found in a local motel, dead of an overdose of cocaine mixed with the synthetic opioid carfentanil. ""It was almost like she was giving me a warning, like she knew,"" Hinkle said.

Five months later, Mikaya Feucht, who had been shuffling through the same network of Chatman-linked houses since March, got kicked out of her sober home after her boyfriend got in a fight with the manager. In the middle of the night, Feucht, her boyfriend and bags holding all of their belongings were dumped at a motel in Boynton Beach.

Curran was in touch with Feucht that night and most of the following two days, trying to figure out a plan to get her daughter stabilized. Then the phone went quiet. At 3:07 on the morning of July 31, two sheriff's officers knocked at the door of Curran's house in Ohio, where Feucht's two boys slept tight.

Curran sat on the couch, tired and confused. It wasn't until an officer knelt on the floor next to her that it clicked. Curran said he told her, ""'We had a detective from Florida get ahold of us.' And I knew. I said, 'What happened to my daughter?' They told me she was found in that hotel.""

“ I'll never let anything happen to you. I'm your mom.”

Local police have responded to 17 overdoses at that motel since 2010, at least five of them deadly. For many addicts caught in the South Florida shuffle, motels are the last stop.

Alison Flory was still living in her sober home the day she died. Things seemed to be going well. Alison would call back to Illinois to talk to her younger siblings for long stretches, chatting about movies or counseling her brother on how to navigate the bullies at school. ""She was their idol, just the fact that she was in Florida was breaking their heart,"" Flory said. ""She was really feeling a bond with family, she was trying to make things right.""

October 13, the last day of Alison's life, was like many before it. She got up, she went to treatment at Reflections, she sat in group therapy, she peed in a cup. Then she went back to her sober home, a yellow bungalow where she and her boyfriend were living with at least three other couples. Shamar Brooks, the 24-year-old ""manager"" who rented and operated the home, lived in the green house next door.

The 911 call came from Brooks at 8:35 the next morning. When he entered the house to wake everyone up to go to Reflections, he told responders, he found Alison wasn't breathing. He couldn't feel a pulse. She was declared dead at 9:09 a.m.

Flory said she never got a call from Brooks, or from Chatman at Reflections. ""No condolences,"" said Flory. ""There was nothing."" It was a roommate of Alison's who called to tell Flory her daughter had died. Brooks told NBC News he considered Alison a friend, and declined further comment.

On May 17, Hinkle, Curran and Flory traveled to Florida for Chatman's sentencing. Each took a turn, along with nine other people, standing before a federal judge in Palm Beach County to tell him what Chatman and the South Florida shuffle had done to their families.

""He had such influence — why didn't he use that influence to help people?"" Flory told the judge as Chatman sat, shackled at the waist and nearly motionless at the table behind her.

Like the other mothers, Flory wanted justice. But above all, she wanted Alison's death to bring change, to save someone else's life.

""There's no sentence that will bring my daughter back,"" Flory added. ""She didn't deserve to die."""

Lynda Obst, who produced ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""Interstellar,"" was the second so-called secret witness asked to testify at pre-trial hearings in Los Angeles. She called him a ""scary person.""

""I was afraid of the defendant,"" she testified. ""He kills witnesses.""

Obst, who appeared in ""The Jinx,"" the HBO series about Durst, was a close friend of Susan Berman, a writer who was murdered in 2000 — allegedly because she knew too much about the millionaire's involvement in the 1982 disappearance of his first wife, Kathie.

Under oath, Obst recalled a conversation she'd had with Berman about Kathie's disappearance. Berman said that at Durst's request she had posed as Kathie and called in sick to Albert Einstein Medical Center, where the missing woman was studying medicine.

The detail is key because the prosecution contends that at the time of the call to Albert Einstein, Kathie was already dead. Convincing a jury that someone else made the call bolsters the district attorney's timeline of the events around her disappearance.

Under cross-examination, Obst, 67, was questioned about why she didn't tell anyone about the call at the time of Kathie's disappearance, after Berman's slaying, or even during her interview for ""The Jinx.""

""It would have been marvelous if I had remembered it,"" she said of her appearance on the HBO show, which examined Durst's links to Kathie's disappearance, Berman's murder and the dismemberment of an elderly neighbor in Texas.

""I did the interview cold.""

It wasn't until she watched ""The Jinx"" and saw a reference to the mysterious call to Albert Einstein that she realized, with ""heart racing,"" that she had potentially important information. She called the director, Andrew Jarecki, who told her to call the district attorney, which she did after much hesitation.

""I was reluctant to get involved,"" she said.

She said that even though Durst is frail and behind bars, she worried about her safety.

""He has means, even from prison,"" she said.

And, she said, she had long suspected that he was behind the death of Berman.

""I suspected Mr. Durst,"" she said. ""I just know that I did.""

Durst, who is serving seven years on a federal gun charge, has pleaded not guilty to murdering Berman; he is not charged in connection with Kathie, who is presumed dead.

The judge has not yet decided if the jury will be allowed to hear testimony from Obst and other pre-trial witnesses who were brought to the stand so their testimony could be recorded in case they are not available during the trial."

A former high school chemistry teacher convicted of cooking meth in New Mexico — not unlike Walter White, the fictional antihero from ""Breaking Bad"" — was sentenced to four years in prison Wednesday, prosecutors said.

New Mexico District Judge Fernando Macias handed the defendant, John W. Gose, a nine-year sentence, all but four years of it suspended. After he is released, Gose must serve five years of supervised probation.

Gose, 56, pleaded guilty in May to trafficking by manufacturing a controlled substance.

He was arrested in October after Las Cruces police officers found a white Styrofoam ice chest containing glassware, rubber tubing and chemicals used to cook methamphetamine during a routine traffic stop, according to prosecutors.

Authorities later found more chemicals and supplies at his home in southern New Mexico. Investigators said he possessed ingredients to make at least a pound of meth — at an estimated street value of $44,800.

When we woke up the following morning we found out we were going to have a baby.

America is the greatest country on Earth, and has provided me as well as my family with so much. While I am a Democrat, when I found out that I was going to be a father to a beautiful baby girl, I put partisanship aside. Like so many other Americans, I want our country to succeed.

As a parent, providing for my family has become priority number one. That means worrying about my daughter’s well-being, finding a home with a great school district, what neighborhoods are the most family friendly and how to teach my daughter to take pride in her American and Hispanic heritage.

But today it seems like politics has invaded everything, making the mundane aspects of parenthood political. I worry about many things, but lately it's been about the future of my daughter's health.

Having a child is a miracle fraught with the realities of human fragility. There are so many things that can go wrong between the time a child is conceived until it is born.

As a father, I am looking for Congress to help ease my fears, not add to them. On this very basic metric, our president and Congress are failing.

No parent wants to be in the position of putting their family’s financial stability in peril to pay for their child’s health care. Yet, The “Better Care Reconciliation Act” (BCRA) and its latest iteration would deprive upwards of 20 million people of the essential health care they need and will gut protections for millions of people with pre-existing conditions. This could increase the cost of care for my family and put undue strain on our pocketbooks.

RELATED: Latinos Are Growing Share of Uninsured: Health Coverage Report

For those who already have health insurance, and don’t have a pre-existing condition, consider the following: being a mom could become a ‘preexisting condition.’ Before the Affordable Care Act (ACA), pregnancy was considered a pre-existing condition, and insurers frequently denied coverage because of it. Carrying a baby carries some risk, so insurance companies see pregnant women as more of an expensive group of customers when they apply for coverage.

But thanks to Obamacare, they can no longer do that. Yet under the Republican bill, insurers may be able to charge higher prices due to a person's recent medical history.

Don’t families deserve better?

One thing a new parent should not have to worry about is whether they are going to have health insurance or go bankrupt paying to keep their child healthy. Under the ACA, 4.2 million Latinos gained insurance coverage and the Latino uninsured rate fell to a record low of 16.2 percent.

Due to the expansion of Medicaid through the ACA, the number of uninsured children dropped significantly. In 2000, around 26 percent of Latino children were uninsured. In 2013, right before major coverage provisions of the ACA took effect, two million Latino children, or 11.5 percent, were uninsured. In 2015, after implementation of the the ACA, that number dropped further to 1.4 million, or 7.5 percent.

This dramatic decline in the number of uninsured Latino children represents the largest drop over a two-year period in our nation’s history.

The Senate bill or BCRA would significantly hurt the progress made in keeping our families healthy. It would erode funding for Medicaid, which is essential in providing health care coverage for 74 million people, including 18 million Latinos.

Repealing the ACA without a replacement would be wildly irresponsible and it's increasingly unlikely that the GOP will come to agreement on a legislative path forward. Republicans must turn to governance and hold hearings in Congress to fix what's wrong with the ACA and make it better. And it's got to be bipartisan. They have to work with Democrats.

And I may be a Latino Democrat, but more and more Americans agree with me. A new poll found that an overwhelming 8 in 10 Americans want Republicans to work with Democrats to fix health care, not strip it from people.

It seems I'm not alone in wanting congressional leaders to make it easier — not harder — for people to save money for their children’s future.

As a parent I am responsible for my child's well being. So all I'm asking is that Congress help families, not add to their financial worries.

Being a parent is an amazing blessing fraught with many challenges. The President and Republicans in Congress should be thinking about how they can make our lives easier not harder.

White'],"Americans might be a little fuzzy on exactly what the Federal Reserve is and why the central bank’s activities matter, but many do believe it’s not working as well as it should.

“When we’re talking about the Fed, not everyone knows exactly what it does,” said Jill Gonzales, an analyst at WalletHub.

As it turns out, that’s an understatement. A recent WalletHub survey found that 16 percent of Americans think the Federal Reserve is in charge of consumer credit scores (it isn’t), and more than half have no idea when the Fed last raised interest rates (last month). Many have no idea who Fed chair Janet Yellen is.

Policy experts warn that this combination of an information gap and a suspicion of the institution could ultimately hurt American wallets and bank accounts.

“The public has almost never really understood what the Fed is or what it does,"" said Peter Conti-Brown, an assistant professor at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ""What's different today is that there is a combination of confusion and strong opinions: People don't quite know what the Fed does, but public trust in the Fed is at a historic low. It's that combination that is dangerous.”

Roughly one in seven Americans thinks the Federal Reserve ought to be abolished, according to WalletHub’s survey, a sentiment Gonzales suggested could be related to current White House sentiment. Donald Trump was critical of the Fed and Fed chair Janet Yellen on the campaign trail.

Related: Trump Says Yellen Should Be Ashamed of Herself

“That and the larger amount of people saying it needs work… under a different administration, those numbers might look different,” Gonzales said.

Who Will Replace Yellen?

The Fed is scheduled to meet today and Wednesday, and recent reports suggest that Trump might replace Yellen, whose term ends next February, with National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive who is not an economist.

“Gary Cohn's appointment could matter a lot for the average American, depending on what happens next. Cohn is famous for being a very effective banker, but not knowing much about monetary policy,” Conti-Brown said. “The Fed Chair must read thousands of pages of economic analysis and routinely gives speeches that are themselves quite technical and long.”

Although much of the Fed’s work on monetary policy is dense or arcane, people do understand, by and large, that the Fed plays a role in interest rates, and that how much they pay to borrow money and service debts is affected by the central bank’s work.

“Interest rate moves have a pocketbook effect although the ability to directly connect the dots, that’s where the dropoff occurs,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com. “People can connect the dots… it’s the specifics where I think people are a little fuzzy.”

An April survey conducted by Bankrate.com found that, although 38 percent of Americans said the current political environment in Washington was the biggest economic threat the nation faced, one in 10 said the biggest threat was rising interest rates.

“I think that one speaks to the pocketbook effect. That was up from 5 percent in September of last year,” McBride said.

“When there’s an organization like the Fed that’s essentially in charge of raising your credit card rate or your savings rate, I think that’s what people pay attention to… even if they don’t necessarily understand it,” Gonzales said.

Half of Americans Don't Like Rate Hikes

WalletHub found that three in 10 Americans think rate hikes are good for the economy, while 36 percent say they are bad and the remaining 34 percent don’t know, while 56 percent think rate hikes are bad for their wallet. “I think it’s interesting that the split between good for the economy and your own wallet is so different,” Gonzales said.

Although most people have a sense that the economy overall has recovered, many don’t feel they have benefited from the resurgence. “Americans still feel left behind. They’re still practically living paycheck to paycheck [and] underemployment is still a problem in many American cities,” Gonzales said.

However, targeting Yellen for replacement could be a risky move, McBride said. The Fed has indicated it wants to continue raising interest rates at a slow and measured pace, as well as winding down a Great Recession-era expansion of its balance sheet. A misstep in either area, due to a lack of experience or to curry political favor, could do real harm to the economy and possibly tip the recovery into a recession.

Related: Five Things to Know About the Latest Rate Hike

“With the Fed getting ready to start winding down the balance sheet and the Fed already having raised interest rates four times, it’d be like changing pilots on final approach,” McBride said. “This is a critical juncture… a change in the head of the Fed that with both of those at play increases the risk of a misstep.”

And the appointment of Cohn to Yellen’s position could compromise the central bank’s adherence to policy over politics. “Cohn will be seen as President Trump's loyalist,” Conti-Brown warned.

The specter of a less-independent Fed increases the risk that the pace of a balance sheet wind-down and interest rate increases would be subject to political pressure, which could throw the American economy into a recession, Conti-Brown said.

“That is the risk that comes with prizing political loyalty over expertise in these appointments,” he said."

During a news conference on board the papal plane, Francis said he would look for common ground at Wednesday's meeting — the first between Trump and the leader of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics.

""First of all, I never judge someone before I listen to the person. I can't do that,"" the pontiff said. ""We will talk and things will come up … I will tell him what I think, he will tell me what he thinks, but I never wanted to judge someone before I listen to the person first.""

Francis also said he and Trump would find ""doors that are not completely shut"" to create conversation, but he declined to say if he thought the meeting could be used to soften Trump's stance on certain issues.

While the pontiff has not directly criticized Trump, he has spoken out about some of his more controversial campaign promises, particularly his pledge to build a wall and ""make Mexico pay for it.""

In February, Francis urged his congregation to ""not raise walls but bridges, to not respond to evil with evil.""

""A Christian can never say, 'I’ll make you pay for that.' Never,"" the pope said at the time. ""That is not a Christian gesture. An offense is overcome with forgiveness, by living in peace with everyone.""

Trump later responded to Francis' remarks in a Facebook post, warning that ""if and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS ... I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been President because this would not have happened.""

He added that others are ""using the Pope as a pawn and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so, especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant.""

The pontiff on Saturday had held a Mass in Fatima, Portugal, where he canonized two girls and a boy who were later interpreted as foretelling World War II, the rise and fall of Communism and the death of a pope.

He reiterated to reporters during his trip that people ""need to find the doors that are at least slightly open.""

Dr. Piraye Yurttas Beim, Founder and CEO, Celmatix

“Even though it's important to be flexible and accommodating with venture capitalists during discussions, know your limits and don't cross them. I could share many anecdotes, but perhaps the worst one was when I once had to endure an hour-long pitch to a very well-known healthcare VC at a top-tier firm who was on his phone doing email the entire time. What made it even more awkward was that he was the only person in the room other than me and my CFO. I kept pausing and asking, ""Should I keep going?"" and he would look up from his phone and say, yes, yes, and then get back to answering his emails.

I left feeling so deflated from that meeting. When I recounted the story to a friend, who is a serial entrepreneur, he told me I should have cut the pitch short and made a polite but swift exit. Why would I want someone like that on my board? And he was right. It was tremendously empowering to have this ""aha"" moment where I took myself out of the ""victim role.""

All of my interactions with prospective outside investors since have been much more efficient and less demoralizing. I should mention as an aside that the investors that we do have on our board are amazingly supportive and respectful, which certainly helps me have the confidence to keep the bar high now and not tolerate disrespectful VC behavior.”

“Join a peer to peer networking group. The one I’m in is called EO (Entrepreneurs' Organization.) I’ve been a member for more than 10 years and it has changed my business.

This means you have a team to go to in order to share and tackle business issues with in a confidential setting.

I’ve received tremendous value from this, which has helped me avoid some very costly mistakes. You can do this in a formal way, as I have done with EO, or you can get a group of fellow business owners together and do it more informally.

“My best piece of entrepreneurial advice is to view failure as a gift. When the business is in pain, it will force you into submission, and if you listen, it will give back to you. For the first two years I was a solo founder, and the business completely broke me. I had two babies under the age of two, a strained marriage, and I was trying to do it all. The business had taken off, but then it stopped. I thought I was growing the Blueprint for soups, but the wholesale market wanted nothing to do with me.

Instead of crying (although there were LOTS of tears) I put one foot in front of the other and opened myself up to the idea of inviting another leader into my realm. Sathish, who is now our CMO and my business partner, with co-founder status, joined in July 2015, and we worked HARD to make a significant pivot in Splendid Spoon: moving the business from a primarily wholesale model to direct to consumer.

""Be your genuine self. It sounds very cliché, but it implies a level of authenticity that staff, customers, and clients all recognize and support.

Another favorite student, my life size Barbie doll head, became the perfect canvas for fine-tuning my makeup application skills for my cosmetology class.

During my college career, I pursued a degree in music, avoiding my true passions — education and makeup. After many unhappy years of teaching music, I then started Makeup Geek. My business is built by creating quality makeup, and educating customers on how to use it. If I solely created makeup products, there would be nothing authentic about the brand. However, bringing in the education element helps me to stand out from the competition. I want makeup lovers to know how to apply our high quality products to test out their skills with my help.

27,http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-s-health-care-bill-remains-shrouded-secrecy-n772456,nbcnews,The Senate’s Health Care Bill Remains Shrouded in Secrecy,"['Benjy Sarlin', 'Leigh Ann Caldwell']","WASHINGTON — The Senate is closing in on a health care bill that could affect coverage for tens of millions of Americans and overhaul an industry that makes up one-sixth of the economy.

Only one problem: Almost no one knows what’s in it.

""I think it's being written, uh, by someone somewhere but I'm not aware of who or where,"" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, deadpanned to NBC News. ""If you get a copy of it, will you send me a copy?""

In a striking break from how Congress normally crafts legislation, including Obamacare, the Senate is conducting its negotiations behind closed doors. The process began five weeks ago, after the House passed its version of health care reform, with a small working group of 13 senators rather than the broader committees who usually handle the issue.

The opaque process makes it impossible to evaluate whether there are any significant changes coming to health care. There are no hearings with health experts, industry leaders, and patient advocacy groups to weigh in where the public can watch their testimony or where Democrats can offer amendments.

“We'll let you see the bill when we finally release it,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) told reporters on Tuesday. He added that “nobody is hiding the ball here” and that people were “free to ask anybody anything.”

Free to ask, but answers are another matter. Republican senators are still negotiating over specific pieces of a bill, but they say they’re close enough to producing legislation that they could hold a vote within weeks. They have been tight-lipped on the details, leaving Americans with only a trickle of leaked ideas that are often vague or speculative.

Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said in a hearing on Thursday that his staff had provided ""technical assistance"" to senators working on the bill, but that he had not seen any ""legislative language"" himself.

Democrats have complained about being shut out, but even some Republican senators have said they’ve had difficulty getting information about the legislation and wished there were more public opportunities to register concerns.

""Would I have preferred a more open process? The answer is yes,” Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) told reporters on Monday evening.

Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said that he’s complained to leadership about the lack of transparency. “I would have liked to have seen a public process — get buy-in from the public,” he said. “I’ve said that in several of our meetings but that’s obviously not what’s going to happen. Now when the bill’s complete, the public then will have a chance to view it.”

Asked if they had seen any legislative text, a Republican aide to a member of the 13-person Senate working group deadpanned: “Why would they show us any legislation?""

The approach is broadly similar to the process that produced the American Health Care Act in the House last month. At the time, leaders released a finished bill and voted on it within 24 hours — so fast that the Congressional Budget Office couldn’t estimate its cost and effects for another three weeks. The move was a jarring shift after years of promises from House GOP leaders to slow down major legislation and post all bills online several days before a vote.

Democrats are increasingly drawing attention to the lack of transparency, which they’ve criticized as an effort to rush through legislation before Americans can scrutinize its effects or individual lawmakers can push for changes.

“Will we have a hearing on the health care proposal?” Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) pressed Finance Chairing Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) in a separate hearing last week. Hatch would not commit to one, but invited McCaskill to pass on her ideas. “We have no idea what’s being proposed,” McCaskill responded.

On Tuesday, several Democratic members linked the closed process to a change in the Senate’s media policy that blocked reporters from filming in the hallways.

“Why are they doing that?” Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said at a weekly press conference. “It's obvious. They don't want the American people to see how poorly they would do under this bill.”

It was not clear there was a connection, however: After blowback, Republicans expressed surprise at the shift and Rules Committee Chairman Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said no new restrictions had been approved.

During the crafting of the Affordable Care Act, Republicans complained about a lack of transparency on the bill that reformed the health care system. Then-House Speaker John Boehner gave a fiery floor speech, saying just before the House vote on Obamacare, “Read the damn bill before you vote.”

But Senate Democrats spent months in 2009 negotiating different versions of a health bill through multiple committees in the House and Senate. The committees then spent days on markups in which members could offer amendments and the full Senate held an open debate on the final version for 25 days. After the House passed the Senate bill in March, they made a series of tweaks using the budget reconciliation process, which Republicans are using exclusively to pass their own bill.

“What’s going on here is backwards,” John McDonough, a professor of public health at Harvard who was a Democratic Senate aide during the ACA debate, told NBC News. “The attempt to keep it in the dark is to make sure that as few Americans as possible know what’s in it and what the implications of it are,” he added.

Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), a member of the Senate leadership team, defended the process on Tuesday, saying Democrats would have an opportunity to offer amendments once the bill was put on the floor. Pressed on the lack of committee hearings or input by a reporter, he described the Senate GOP working group as “a committee of the whole.”

Critics see the gambit as a response to the House bill’s poor reception after the CBO estimated it would leave 23 million fewer people insured, while raising premiums and deductibles for many low-income and older Americans. A Kaiser Health tracking poll in May found 55 percent of respondents have an unfavorable view of the House bill versus 31 percent who view it favorably, and most polls have found a similarly negative reaction.

Asked whether Republicans were operating from the assumption any bill they passed would be unpopular, Barrasso suggested he wasn’t concerned about pleasing their loudest critics.

“There is nothing that I think that the Senate can pass that is going to satisfy the left activists in California [whose] state senators have just voted for a single payer plan,” he said.

There are some factors that could slow down the Senate. In comparison to the House, the Senate is barred from voting on a bill before a cost and impact estimate is released from the nonpartisan CBO.

But if the Senate is to really vote before they leave town for a week on June 30th, a goal that many Republicans hope is still achievable, that leaves little time for the public to see legislation. A CBO score takes 10 to 14 days to produce. There are only 17 days left before the end of the month."

Perry actually was talking with comedians known in Russia for targeting celebrities and politicians with audacious stunts, Energy Department spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes said in a written statement.

Pranksters Vladimir Krasnov and Alexei Stolyarov are sometimes called the ""Jerky Boys of Russia,"" after an American duo who put out recordings of their prank phone calls in the 1990s. They have made faux calls to British singer Elton John, who thought he was speaking to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and others.

""These individuals are known for pranking high-level officials and celebrities, particularly those who are supportive of an agenda that is not in line with their governments. In this case, the energy security of Ukraine,"" Hynes said.

During the 22-minute call on July 19, Perry, whose department oversees the U.S. nuclear weapons program, discussed a range of topics in a business-like tone, including sanctions against Russia and helping Ukraine develop oil and gas.

Perry said the Trump administration opposes Nord Stream 2, a Russian project to bring natural gas to Europe across the Baltic and that U.S. technology could help Ukraine develop gas.

""Giving Ukraine more options with some of our technology is, I think, in everyone's best interest with the exception of the Russians, but that's OK,"" he said.

Perry also discussed the Paris climate accord and coal exports on the call.

The call, first reported by E&E news, was recorded and posted online.

It happened about a month after Perry met with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and his delegation at the Energy Department.

President Donald Trump said last month that Washington plans to offer Ukraine more coal exports from the United States because the eastern European nation's industrial sector has difficulty securing coal from separatist-held regions.

It is unclear how the United States would bring more coal to Ukraine but Perry hinted on the call that the Commerce Department was working on it.

""The coal conversation at this particular point in time is with (Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross) and I full well suspect it will go forward,"" he said on the call.

News of the call came the same day the U.S. House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to impose new sanctions on Russia."

The sanctions announced Wednesday were against current and former government officials and business leaders that the U.S. identified as being involved in staging for Maduro the election of new members of a national constituent assembly. The assembly would be given orders to make changes to the constitution and potentially allow Maduro to expand his power.

Maduro has said he wants the changes to restore peace and order to Venezuela. But opponents held a non-binding referendum against the plan. Some 7 million Venezuelans in the country and around the globe turned out to reject Maduro's plan.

The Treasury action freezes the assets in the U.S. of the Venezuelan officials and prohibits anyone in the U.S. from dealing with them.

“Our sanctions demonstrate the United States is standing by the Venezuelan people in their quest to restore their country to a full and prosperous democracy,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. “Anyone elected to the National Constituent Assembly should know that their role in undermining democratic processes and institutions in Venezuela could expose them to potential U.S. sanctions.”

Other Venezuelan officials have been sanctioned by the U.S., including Venezuela Vice President Tareck El Aissami, whose assets were frozen under the Kingpin Act.

Opponents of Maduro have been staging months of protests and held two national worker and business strikes to prevent the constituent assembly vote from going forward. Numerous people have died and hundreds have been injured or jailed in some of the protests.

Anger at the government has grown as food and basic necessities have become scarce and inflation has soared, although Maduro, the handpicked successor of Hugo Chavez, still has support in the country.

“The Venezuelan opposition estimates up to 15,000 civilians have been wounded in recent protests, with over 3,000 arrested and 431 political prisoners in detention,” the Treasury office said. “Arbitrary arrests are rampant, as is physical abuse against detainees; alleged instances of torture and other violations and abuses are perpetrated by the Bolivarian National Guard, the Bolivarian National Police and other security forces.”

Venezuela has been defiant in the face of other threats from the U.S., dismissing Trump's promise last week to take “strong and swift” economic sanctions. He also declared Maduro a “a bad leader who dreams of becoming a dictator.”

Those sanctioned are: Tibisay Lucena Ramirez, president of the Maduro-controlled National Electoral Council and president of his board of elections; Elias José Jaua Milano, head of the Presidential Commission for the National Constituent Assembly and also minister of education and former executive vice president of Venezuela; Tarek William Saab Halabi, Venezuela’s ombudsman, whose job is to defend human rights in the country and Maria Iris Varela Rangel, member of the Presidential Commission for the National Assembly.

Also sanctioned are the country’s minister of Interior, Justice and Peace and leaders and former leaders of Venezuela's security forces.

The Treasury Department said Venezuelan government corruption is “associated heavily” with its state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela and the official exchange rate regime set by the National Center for Foreign Commerce. Officials from those entities also were sanctioned.

Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., said in a statement she welcomed the sanctions particularly against the military and security officials. She said only with such sanctions “can we send a clear message that we will not tolerate abuse happening in Venezuela.”

Related: Venezuela Crisis Enters Pivotal Week

Members of Congress of Cuban descent, like Ros-Lehtinen, have been some of the loudest voices against Venezuela. Several have made comparisons of the Maduro government to Cuba under the Fidel and Raul Castro regime.

Democrat Sen. Bob Menendez, from New Jersey and also Cuban-American, said the targeted sanctions were necessary. But he called on other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to bolster the U.S. action with their own.

""The world is watching and our hemisphere must not stand by as Venezuela burns and millions clamor for help,"" Menendez said."

According to BCC Research analyst Natana Raj, Americans shelled out more than $43 billion on sleep aids and sleep tech in 2016, and that number is on the rise.

But with all the gadgets on the market, which one deserves a spot on your nightstand or under your pillow?

ResMed S+ Sleep Sensor - $129.99

If you want to track your sleep, but don't like the idea of wearable device like a Fitbit, then the ResMed S+ is a great option. Once you aim the tall rectangular device towards yourself, it tracks breathing and body movements to analyze how well you're sleeping.

With its companion app, it then offers a ""sleep score,"" graph showing when it thinks you were in deep, light, and REM sleep.

The tracking technology is based on ten years of research by the ResMed team, and, after our testing, it seems to have mostly paid off. It did a good job figuring out when we were in bed, and the sleep analysis seemed to reflect how rejuvenating (or not) sleep felt.

ResMed

The app tries to offer feedback, too, though some of it is common sense - like taking a bath to relax before sleep and getting more exercise. The device is reliant on the app and Bluetooth connectivity to your phone, and in our testing, it became unpaired after a few nights. It was easy to pair it again, but having to troubleshoot Bluetooth before bed isn't exactly relaxing.

It also monitors the conditions in your bedroom - like temperature, light, and noise level - in case those factors could be keeping you from your ideal sleep.

The company notes that ResMed technology will soon be integrated in a new sleep tracker from SleepScore Labs, so keep an eye out for that later this summer if you can wait.

BEDDI Glow Smart Alarm Clock with Wake Up Light - $79.99

Also vyiing for space on your nightstand, BEDDI Glow from WITTI is an alarm clock that can wake you up naturally with a simulated sunrise. The light is customizable in any color you could possibly want, and can gradually increase its glow for up to 30 minutes before your alarm time.

You can download their companion app and pair your BEDDI Glow alarm with music from your smartphone, the radio, or services like Apple Music and Spotify.

It's an attractive bedside companion with thoughtful additions like traffic and weather updates at the press of a button - though just with a computerized voice that's reliant on your smartphone.

As smart alarm clocks go, BEDDI Glow is a good choice for a much gentler and more customizable wake-up than the blaring of an alarm from a smartphone.

Smart Nora Snoring Solution - $299

If you or the person who shares your bed is a snorer, think of the Smart Nora as the improved, high-tech version of prodding them to get them to switch positions.

The device has two parts: an electronic sensor that looks like a white computer mouse that sits on your nightstand, aimed in your direction, and an inflating pillow insert attached to a fabric case. When the sensor ""hears"" snoring, the sleeve under the pillow inflates. The idea is that the movement of the pillow will stimulate the relaxed throat muscles that cause the snoring and then allow for natural breathing to resume.

In testing, the Smart Nora did seem to decrease the frequency and volume in our house's snorer - making for a more restful night for everyone. We found the device's 30 minute delay option particularly useful, because if not engaged, Smart Nora would interpret pillow talk as snoring and start the inflating and deflating. And a rising and falling pillow is not exactly a mood setter before bedtime. Plus, while Smart Nora is described as ""silent,"" we could amost always hear a gentle inflating noise (when we were awake).

Aesthetically speaking, some might be bothered by the plastic tube that extends from beneath the pillow since it does give the Smart Nora the look of a medical device (which it is not). You can hide the device's boxy kit under the bed, but there's no easy way to disguise the tube.

This pillow has built-in speakers, a sleep tracker, and it's comfortable, thanks to being filled with memory foam. Rem-Fit

Zeeq Smart Pillow from Rem-Fit - $299

This pillow is really trying to do it all, which is probably at least part of the reason why it costs so much (for a pillow). One of its most attractive features of the Zeeq Smart Pillow is its ability to play sound that's audible only to the person whose head is resting on the pillow, not his or her bed companion. This could be great for a couple where one partner likes to fall asleep to music or an audio book, but the other needs silence. In testing, it delivers on this ability for music or for an alarm.

Despite the fact that the pillow has multiple speakers, a gyroscope, a battery and a microphone inside it, it's comfortable thanks to being filled with (purple!) pieces of memory foam.

Zeeq also promises to stop snoring with its embedded microphone and two vibrating motors that buzz when snoring is detected. We found the inflation of the Smart Nora more gentle than the buzz of the pillow, but this inevitably varies by the individual.

Like the S+ sleep tracker from ResMed, Zeeq also has a companion app and is marketed as a sleep tracker. But, the tracker relies on motion detection by the pillow, unless you spend more on a sleep monitoring strap that collects heart rate and respiratory rate information.

With any device promising to give detailed information about how well you are sleeping, most sleep experts say not to hang your hat on the sleep scores they offer.

""If one's using it hoping to find, 'Oh, I'm getting this much deep sleep versus REM sleep,' there they're not quite as accurate,"" said Dr. Shelly Zak of the Sleep Disorders Center at the University of California at San Francisco. ""Use them as sort of a general guide, but not as a specific measure,"" she advised.

Athlete Recovery Sleepwear from Under Armour - $60/garment and up

Under Armour is getting in on the sleep game, too, by printing what they call bioceramics on the inside of the fabric of their garments. According to the company, this fabric can absorb body heat and reflect it back as far-infrared energy.

The company points to studies from the National Institute of Health that show positive impacts of far-infrared energy on recovery - things like helping your body restore muscles while you rest.

In testing, the pajamas were very comfortable, but it's hard to really put a finger on whether we felt particularly restored (or any different at all) when we woke up.

According to Dr. Zak, further study would be needed to really prove that pajamas can actually improve sleep quality. ""It's intriguing,"" said Zak. ""But they would need larger studies and more controlled studies to really make an assessment of whether or not it's efficacious,"" she said.

Of course, there are plenty of free options for improving your sleep — no gizmos required.

Doctors say basic changes like minimizing noises from your sleep environment (especially those you might not think of, like an air conditioner clicking on in the middle of the night and waking you up) can make a huge difference. And, try to stick to a regular sleep schedule and spend a minimum of an hour relaxing or ""winding down"" before bed."

The CHC has stated its members will oppose a batch of spending bills, deemed necessary to support national security, if the bills include money for the border wall with Mexico.

House GOP members have said they plan border wall funding in the spending bills and intend to prohibit debate or a vote on the wall money apart from the bills that pay for military, veterans affairs, legislative and energy and water development programs and projects.

BOLD PAC, the caucus' political action committee, is running the ads. The ads urge viewers to stop congressional Republicans from ""sneaking in funding for Trump's border wall.""

The ads are targeted at Republican Reps. Martha McSally of Arizona; Jeff Denham, Ed Royce, Steve Knight and David Valadao of California and Will Hurd and John Culberson of Texas. Each ad is tailored to the specific lawmaker.

Hurd, whose vast Texas congressional district hugs the U.S.-Mexican border, sponsored an amendment to the batch of spending bills requiring that Department of Homeland Security provide a comprehensive border security strategy to Congress before any money is used for the border wall or other barriers.

The amendment, first reported by The Hill, requires DHS provide more detail on technology it wants to use, costs per mile of border for their use and more specifics on where they would be used, among other things.

Despite the amendment, BOLD PAC had no plans to drop its ad targeting Hurd. A spokesman for the PAC said it wants to keep the pressure up for the money to be dropped from the bills.

DiNardo faces four counts of criminal homicide, conspiracy to commit criminal homicide, and abuse of corpse, as well as 12 other charges.

Kratz faces three counts of criminal homicide, three counts of conspiracy to commit criminal homicide, three counts of abuse of corpse and 11 other charges.

According to NBC Philadelphia, Kratz was arrested by Philadelphia police late on Thursday at his home in the city.

Related: Cosmo DiNardo Confesses to Killing Four Missing Men in Pennsylvania

The murders occurred over a few days in early July. All four men — identified as Jimi Taro Patrick, 19, Dean Finocchiaro, 19; Thomas Meo, 21; and Mark Sturgis, 22 — met with DiNardo and Kratz to purchase large quantities of marijuana, according to the Bucks County District Attorney's office, though it remains unclear if drugs were the motive behind the killings.

""I don't know [why DiNardo and Kratz killed them],"" Bucks County District Attorney Matthew Weintraub told reporters on Friday. ""We may never know.""

At DiNardo and Kratz's arraignment later in the day, both men entered a plea of not guilty.

Bucks County District Court Judge Maggie Snow scheduled the men's preliminary hearings on July 31 and set no bail. She also ordered that they not be placed in the same prison out of concern for their safety.

DiNardo admitted to the four murders on Thursday and told authorities where to find the bodies, according to his attorney Paul Lang.

The body of one of the men was found at the bottom of a 12½-foot-deep grave on a farm in Bucks County owned by DiNardo's parents. The three other victims were found in a metal tank that was buried on the farm, according to the affidavit.

DiNardo told police that he agreed to sell Patrick four pounds of marijuana for $8,000 and brought him to the farm on July 5, according to the probable cause affidavit. Patrick only had $800, so DiNardo offered to sell him a shotgun instead. He then took Patrick to a remote part of the property, shot him with a .22 and buried him with a backhoe, according to the affidavit.

Two days later, DiNardo offered to sell a quarter-pound of marijuana to Finocchiaro for approximately $700, the affidavit said. On the way, DiNardo picked up Kratz and allegedly gave him a .357 handgun. They allegedly agreed to rob Finocchiaro.

While at the farm, Kratz shot Finocchiaro in the head, according to DiNardo's statement to police. DiNardo then took the gun and allegedly shot Finocchiaro while he was on the ground. They used a backhoe to place the body in a metal tank that DiNardo referred to as a ""pig roaster,"" the affidavit said.

On the same day, the affidavit said, DiNardo met with Meo and Sturgis not far from the farm and brought them back to the property under the guise of a marijuana deal. Kratz waited for them, as he and DiNardo agreed to rob the pair.

When they returned to the farm, DiNardo allegedly shot Meo in the back and shot Sturgis as he tried to run away with the .357 handgun.

He then allegedly ran over Meo, who was still alive, with the backhoe before lifting both men's bodies in a metal tank. He poured gasoline inside and lit them on fire.

He buried the tank the next day with Kratz's help.

Kratz's statement to police on Thursday was similar to DiNardo's, though he claimed he did not shoot anyone.

DiNardo was originally arrested on Monday for an unrelated gun charge. He is not allowed to own a gun because of his history of mental illness.

A Texas family has created a best-selling line of healthy tortillas and tortilla chips sold in national chains like Whole Foods, and it all started with a conversation between siblings.

Veronica Garza, co-founder and president of the Austin-based Siete Family Foods, was home for the summer after completing her Master's in Business Administration. In a conversation with her brother Roberto about several auto-immune conditions she has had since high school, he suggested that a grain and gluten-free diet could help alleviate the symptoms she’d been struggling with since her diagnosis. She decided to follow his advice.

“I started doing that, and when I did my whole family just jumped on board with me,” said Veronica.

But it meant giving up the flour tortillas that were a staple of her family’s Mexican-American diet, so she created a recipe using almond flour to fill that void. It may have stayed in the family if her youngest brother Miguel, just out of law school, hadn’t intervened.

“Miguel kind of convinced me and my mom that we should turn this into a business,” Veronica said.

Miguel also convinced the buyer of the Austin’s Wheatsville Food Co-Op to meet with them.

“I packed a little ziplock with maybe 10 tortillas, no packaging, no company name,” said Veronica. “We just had a product.”

Miguel insisted the buyer try the tortillas in front of them. The buyer liked what he tasted and was ready to place an order. The Garzas weren’t ready to produce them just yet, but they found a commercial kitchen soon after, officially launching Siete Family Foods in 2014.

“We would hand press the tortillas for hours, until 3 in the morning sometimes, every weekend, then that became every day,"" recalled Veronica about how her parents and her siblings got the products started. ""I had to quit my job because I didn’t have time for it anymore,” said Veronica.

RELATED: At Food Show, Latin American Vendors Aim for U.S. Market

Their efforts paid off; their products are now nationally distributed in over 500 stores, including Whole Foods, and six of the seven members of the Garza family work for the business full time.

“We want to become the grain-free, Mexican-American food brand for this generation,” said Miguel. “We want to be a household name and we want to do that because we can have more impact.”

Co-founders of Siete Family Foods, Veronica and Miguel Garza. Courtesy of Veronica Garza

The Garzas reflect a diverse Mexican lineage and roots in Texas going back six generations. Their maternal grandfather, Antonio Campos, was a civil rights advocate and had a law degree. He helped develop the ""The Schools of the 400”, a program for non-English speaking children that would become a model for Head Start, among other initiatives.

We spoke to Veronica and Miguel about how they got started, the family dynamic that keep them going, and the mission propels them forward.

Why was it so important to re-incorporate tortillas into your diet?

Veronica: We lived in Laredo, a border town in Texas, right across the bridge from Mexico. Tortillas are a staple in our diet and always have been when were growing up. We just felt like we were missing out not being able to eat any, missing out on some of our culture.

Was there a point when you decided that this was an idea you could develop and market?

Veronica: I thought that there was business potential here, but I had no idea what to do, so there was a lot of fear of how to go about that. When I brought my family into the picture, as far as launching a business, it kind of all came together because I had that support that I needed.

Siete Cassava & Coconut Tortillas Courtesy of Siete Family Foods

Miguel: Maybe I was opportunistic but I kind of just weaseled my way into it as the baby of the family does. Like my sister, I thought the product and idea was something that would be life changing for a lot of people, and I convinced her that I could have a positive impact of the future success of the business. The verdict is still out, but I’m trying.

We all know the challenges of working with family. What’s the upside?

Veronica: We had a gym together before we launched this business. So we enjoy being around each other, we enjoy working with each other. Everybody has a different set of skills they contribute to the business. And we know each other so you don’t have to walk on eggshells. It works out for us.

You describe Siete Family Foods as a mission-based company. What is that mission and how would you like to see it grow?

Miguel: Our tortillas and chips are in the marketplace and if people want to eat them, that’s fantastic. But we have this goal of educating people on what food is, what food does to the body, and how it can shape you’re health and wellness. Education is a massive undertaking because, as an entire society, we’ve lost some of the intimacy with our food, where we don’t know what is actually going in our body. At a macro level, we have this idea that we can bring people back to the table, that we want to create products that are inclusive.

We [also] have parents and grandparents before us that have forged a path to create opportunities for us. I want to do the same thing for this generation and the next. Whatever we’re doing is to lift people up. On the business side, I have that as a goal for myself, to create more opportunity.

RELATED: 4 Delicious Latino Food Trends: We Asked the Chefs

Veronica: That’s definitely a family mission too, something ingrained in us. Especially with my grandfather who was very involved with Mexican-American civil rights. I studied Mexican-American studies in college, that was my degree, and initially I thought I would go to law school and follow the path that my father, sister, and eventually my brother took. To have something to do with public policy to effect a positive change for Latinos. I didn’t end up doing that.

So I do feel that having this business can do that. Especially, if we can have a company that I could be a mentor to someone, a Latina that is trying to do something similar, that would be great. I would feel like I’ve done something positive for my community. It’s not a mission for our business but something personal."

The Vero Beach, Florida resident recently published a book, Vibrant at Any Age, based on her lifelong journey of self-improvement. She hopes to inspire people to achieve their goals just as she has.

“I reinvent myself every ten years, and so I started my 60s as a bodybuilder and now I begin my 70s as a writer,” she said. “I don´t impose limitations on myself. People limit themselves by age, nationality, gender, it's very frustrating. Age is a mindset.”

Dr. Josefina started bodybuilding at an age when most are contemplating retirement, though she was an athlete from an early age. As a child in Venezuela she took to gymnastics and later graduated with a physical education degree.

She later obtained a Master's in Education and later a Ph.D. in Adult Personal Development. She taught at Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for 16 years, while raising two daughters.

“I started bodybuilding when I met Steve Pfiester, a gym guy who knew I ran and practiced yoga. He invited me to his gym and offered to train me. I started in January and by June he took me to my first competition in Bradenton, Florida,” she said.

Dr. Josefina´s photos are proof that she dedicates long hours to taking care of her body. But she also nurtures her mind and spirit. On any given day, she gets up at 3 a.m. to read the Bible, meditate and pray. At 4.30 a.m. she´s out the door to walk three miles and run another three. This is followed by yoga and and a swim at the beach while the sun rises.

“The aging process can be slowed down by taking care of mind, body and spirit,” she said.

While this sounds like a workout already, it does not stop there. After writing in her journal and working on her next book between 8 and 10 a.m, the vibrant Venezuelan American hits the gym for at least two hours, where she trains different muscle groups depending on the day of the week.

“My workout is sacred, non-negotiable. I keep a very tight schedule so I don´t lose track of time,” she says.

Her afternoons are devoted to relaxing, goal-setting, cleaning, reading and grocery shopping.

“I keep my life simple. I don´t drink or smoke, I don´t stress, I eat a balanced diet and by 8 p.m. lights are out.”

Dr. Josefina´s war on ageism has rubbed off on her two daughters, both in their early thirties. “They both take care of their bodies and minds. They´re very proud of me now and brag about me. If you give them a good foundation as a parent, know that they will always come back to their roots. I tried to remind myself of that during the difficult teen years.”

To prove how strongly she feels about fighting ageism she confessed she never accepts the senior discount whenever it’s offered at stores.

“If I concede, then it means I believe in that system. It´s like being a traitor! I pay my full amount, and continue to live the way I want to, regardless of my age,” she says.

Dr. Josefina has hosted several shows, the latest being Empowerment with Dr. Josefina, a local television show in Indian River County, Florida. She also has a YouTube channel where she shares her journey of fitness and empowerment.

She says she would love to see more Latinas breaking age stereotypes. “I can´t do this alone,” she said. “I would love more people to take ownership of their body, mind and spirit. If you exercise and take care of yourself you can look and feel better than someone twice as young. My bone density and muscle mass are better now than a few years ago. And it´s because I work at it.”

When people tell her they want to look like her when they reach her age, she has a simple comeback: “Why not do it now? You need to be disciplined, like me. Some mornings I don´t want to get up. But then I think of the consequences that would have in the long run and that gets me right out of bed.”

Dr. Josefina is already preparing for her next bodybuilding competition and wondering what her next reinvention will be like.

“One of the things I´ve been thinking to myself lately is that we should never give up on ourselves. I certainly don´t. Give yourself the opportunity to fail. Don´t let fear be stronger than the excitement of being yourself and winning!”

Eisenstein'],"After Volkswagen was caught cheating on diesel emissions, consumers have become more skeptical about diesel vehicles. Now, manufacturers across the globe are forced to rethink their plans for the high-mileage technology.

Facing accusations that it also duped emissions tests, Daimler AG this week announced the recall of 3 million diesel vehicles sold in Europe. Industry analysts believe the automaker could follow up with a similar move in the U.S. where it is under investigation by the Environmental Protection Agency.

Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz brand previously announced it wouldn’t sell any diesel models in the United States during the 2017 model-year, and it has not said whether it will return with any of its so-called “oil burners” in future years.

Daimler is just the latest manufacturer to face allegations it rigged its diesel engines to illegally pass emissions tests. Volkswagen AG has so far spent about $30 billion on legal fees, fines and a massive buyback after admitting it rigged two of its engines with what the EPA called a “defeat device.” The U.S. government is currently suing Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in a similar case.

Still other automakers are finding themselves under a cloud of diesel smoke. And that is raising the prospect that what had looked like a strong comeback for high-mileage diesel technology just a few years ago may be turning into a bust.

Porsche CEO Oliver Blume told Reuters this week, “We are looking at the issue” and may stop offering diesels entirely in the next few years, though he added, “We have not made a decision” yet.

A Shift from Diesel to Electric

The Volkswagen brand, which once counted on diesels for one-quarter of its U.S. sales, won’t bring the technology over any more and is looking to scale back diesel technology globally, shifting focus to electrified powertrain technologies: hybrids, plug-in hybrids and pure battery-electric vehicles.

The maker has been forced to buy back or repair over 500,000 TDI models, and got permission from the EPA to sell off some leftover 2016 offerings that have been updated to meet tough American emissions standards. They’ve been going quickly, in part due to sizable incentives. But no new diesel models will follow.

Whether Daimler will bring diesels back to the U.S. has not yet been decided, said Rob Moran, chief spokesman for Mercedes-Benz USA. “We constantly review our portfolio offerings,” he told NBC News, adding that even if the company is cleared by regulators, “with the increased effort to certify diesel engines in the U.S., we have put the certification process for diesel passenger cars on hold.”

In the early part of the decade, diesel technology looked ready to stage its first significant comeback since the 1980s. Manufacturers, especially Europeans, started rolling out a new generation of “oil-burners” that shed all the problems of the diesels that Americans came to hate in the 1980s. Those older models were slow, noisy and smelly. The new engines, the industry said, were quick, clean — and even more fuel-efficient than before.

Or so it seemed.

A Multi-Billion-Dollar Problem

In September 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency accused Volkswagen of using a “defeat device” to reduce emissions of smog-causing oxides of nitrogen when the vehicles were being tested. In real-world use, however, they would produce up to 40 times the allowable limit.

VW soon acknowledged that subterfuge, which put sales of vehicles using both its 2.0- and 3.0-liter diesels on hold. It has since spent nearly $30 billion in fines and settlements and on a plan to buy back almost all of the vehicles using those rigged engines. It has, however, received permission to fix some later-model vehicles, including the 2015 VWs it is now trying to sell off.

The scandal cast a smoky pall over the entire industry, regulators going back to see if other makers had played similar games. In January, the EPA charged Fiat Chrysler Automobiles with rigging some of its own diesel models, a charge CEO Sergio Marchionne has vociferously rejected. But, for now, the agency has refused to certify diesel versions of the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ram 1500 pickups, meaning they can’t be sold in the U.S.

“I think a lot of industry marketing types are worrying about getting a black eye if another glitch shows up,” analyst Joe Phillippi of AutoTrends Consulting told NBC News. And, ultimately, “the question becomes whether you can justify the cost if the volumes aren’t there,"" he said.

There are some manufacturers still committed to diesel, notably General Motors, which has options available on its Chevrolet Cruze passenger car line, as well as the midsize Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon pickups.

Mazda, after struggling to come up with a formula that would deliver good mileage and performance — and meet emissions rules — is finally set to launch the SkyActiv-D engine in its CX-5 crossover, and it has suggested that if that diesel reaches a 10 percent share it will look at other models to use it in.

Diesels have long remained an engine of choice for medium- and heavy-duty truck buyers. And Ford recently announced plans to add a diesel option for its light duty full-size F-150.

Diesel demand “took a hit after the Volkswagen crisis,” said Steve Hansen, of the trade group, the Diesel Technology Forum, but “there has been an upturn in recent months, along with some significant announcements from automakers.”

But the numbers aren’t quite so upbeat. U.S. diesel sales are down 35 percent year-over-year, according to HybridCars.com. (Though the website does not track all heavy-duty models, observers say it captures the general trend of recent times.)

A Global Decline in Diesel

What’s worrisome to manufacturers committed to diesel is that the U.S. trend isn’t entirely unique. Backed by government subsidies, diesel demand has been declining in Europe. There, a growing number of environmentalists and regulators have begun echoing the skepticism of their American counterparts. Paris, for example, is looking to ban diesels entirely.

Related: These Countries Want to Ban Diesel and Gas Vehicles

Where diesels currently account for about 50 percent of European sales, that is projected to drop to as little as 30 percent by 2020, and the UBS Group forecasts the global share held by diesels will drop from 13.5 percent today to just 4 percent by 2025.

There are some questionable assumptions baked into such forecasts, notably the expectation that after a very slow start electrified vehicles will suddenly gain traction in the marketplace. Last year, all forms of battery-based models, from light hybrids to pure EVs, however, captured barely 3 percent of the American market, and it remains to be seen if U.S. buyers will be more interested in the lower-priced, longer-range models just now coming to showrooms.

But automakers are shifting resources. Long one of the biggest diesel proponents, VW now plans to have 30 pure electric models in its portfolio by 2025 and is even launching a battery sub-brand, VW I.D.

Should such vehicles fail to catch on, automakers may have to rethink their product plans, and diesels could give them a way to meet increasingly tough global emissions and mileage standards. But, as it now stands, oil-burners are likely to face tough times in the coming years."

Pell, 76, who as Pope Francis' top financial adviser is the No. 3 official at the Vatican, said nothing as he fought his way through a crowd of media and onlookers into Melbourne Magistrates' Court on Wednesday morning (Tuesday evening ET).

The hearing was a procedural session intended to set the dates of future hearings, and cameras weren't allowed in the courtroom.

Police have released no details of the charges, other than to say they represented ""multiple complainants.""

When the charges were announced last month, Pell promised to defend himself vigorously, saying, ""The whole idea of sexual abuse is abhorrent to me.""

The charges came as yet another shock to the church, coming only four months after Pell appeared to side with critics of the Vatican's handling of decades of sexual abuse allegations.

Testifying in February as part of a government hearing into abuse by Australian priests, Pell said: ""I'm not here to defend the indefensible. The church has made enormous mistakes and is working to remedy those, but the church in many places, certainly in Australia, has mucked things up, has let people down.""

But a sea change is afoot that is forecast to kick gas-powered vehicles to the curb, replacing them with cars that run on batteries. A flurry of news this week underscores just how rapidly that change could happen.

A quick recap: On Monday, Tesla announced that the Model 3, its mass-market electric car, would start rolling off production lines this week with the first handful delivered to customers later this month. Then on Wednesday, Volvo announced that every car it produces will have a battery in it by 2019, putting it at the forefront of major car manufacturers. Then came France’s announcement on Thursday that it would ban the sale of gas-powered cars by 2040.

All this news dropped just in time for Bloomberg New Energy Finance's latest electric car report, which lays out why electric cars are the way of the future and when they’re projected to take over the market. The authors said although electric vehicles are currently a tiny fraction of the car market, that market could reach an inflection point sometime between 2025-2030. After that, electric car sales are slated to increase rapidly.

Related: Driving on Roads of the Future Will Be a Real Trip

Driven by the falling cost of batteries and the growing number of automakers producing a wider variety of electric cars, Bloomberg NEF expects that electric cars will account for 54 percent of all car sales globally by 2040. That’s a huge uptick from its forecast last year of electric vehicles accounting for 35 percent of all sales.

The shift to electric vehicles will disrupt the fossil fuel industry. The 530 million total electric cars forecast to be on the road by 2040 will require 8 million fewer barrels of oil a day to run.

One of the big pitches for electric cars is their positive benefit for the climate because they reduce the use of oil. But they will require a lot more power from the electric grid. Energy use from electric vehicles is expected to rise 300 times above current demand, putting more strain on power generation.

How that energy is produced will go a long way toward determining how climate-friendly electric cars actually are. A recent Climate Central analysis looked at all 50 states and found that the energy mix was clean enough in 37 of them to ensure electric cars are more climate friendly than their most fuel-efficient combustion engine counterparts.

Related: Why Flying Cars Still Haven't Gotten Off the Ground

That’s a sharp uptick from a 2013 analysis, which found that there were just 13 states where electric cars were cleaner than gas-powered ones, and it’s driven in large part by a precipitous drop in coal use.

While the U.S. is projected to be one of the biggest drivers of the electric vehicle revolution, China and the European Union will also be major players. By 2025, Bloomberg NEF’s projections show that China will be the biggest buyer of electric vehicles in the world, a trend that continues through 2040.

That means how China's energy mix develops will be one of the most important factors to determining how climate friendly all the new electric vehicles on the road will be.

It issued a reminder this week that swapping out artery-clogging saturated fats such as butter with healthy vegetable fats can do as much good for some people as taking a statin drug.

A car makes its way on a road through flowering canola fields on a serpentine section of the L401 highway near Nienstedt, Germany on May 12, 2016. Julian Stratenschulte / dpa via AP

“Scientific studies that lowered intake of saturated fat and replaced it with polyunsaturated vegetable oil reduced cardiovascular disease by approximately 30 percent; similar to cholesterol-lowering drugs, known as statins,” the organization said in a ""presidential advisory.""

These experts stress the word “replace.” That means not just cutting the bad fats — it also means adding the “good” fats, such as corn, soybean and peanut oil.

One reminder that may surprise some people — coconut oil may come from a tree, but it’s not a particularly healthful fat.

“Several studies found that coconut oil — which is predominantly saturated fat and widely touted as healthy — raised LDL cholesterol the same way as other saturated fats found in butter, beef fat and palm oil,” said the American Heart Association advisory, which published in the journal Circulation.

Another possible surprise: All fats are a mix of saturated, polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats. The Heart Association said polyunsaturated fats appear to lower the risk of heart disease the most, followed by monounsaturated fats. Saturated fats are the least desirable.

The advisory also lists which fats are healthier:

Safflower oil: 75 percent polyunsaturated fat

Sunflower oil: 66 percent polyunsaturated fat

Canola oil: 63 percent monounsaturated/ 28 percent polyunsaturated fat

Corn oil: 55 percent polyunsaturated fat/ 28 percent monounsaturated fat

Olive oil: 73 percent monounsaturated fat

Peanut oil: 46 percent monounsaturated fat/ 32 percent polyunsaturated fat

Butter: 63 percent saturated fat/ 26 percent monounsaturated fat

Coconut oil: 82 percent saturated fat

Lard: 39 percent saturated fat/45 percent monounsaturated fat

Palm oil: 82 percent saturated fat/ 11 percent monounsaturated fat

Heart disease is the No. 1 killer in the U.S. and in most industrialized countries. “Nearly 808,000 people in the United States died of heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases in 2014, translating to about one of every three deaths,” the Heart Association said.

The Heart Association and American College of Cardiology advise anyone with questionable cholesterol readings to get saturated fat down to just 5 percent of total calories.

Related: Heart attacks, strokes fell after trans-fat ban

“We want to set the record straight on why well-conducted scientific research overwhelmingly supports limiting saturated fat in the diet to prevent diseases of the heart and blood vessels,” said Dr. Frank Sacks, lead author of the advisory and professor of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

“Saturated fat increases LDL — bad cholesterol — which is a major cause of artery-clogging plaque and cardiovascular disease.”

Saturated fats are found in meat, full-fat dairy products and tropical oils such as coconut, palm and others.

“A healthy diet doesn’t just limit certain unfavorable nutrients, such as saturated fats, that can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and other blood vessel diseases. It should also focus on healthy foods rich in nutrients that can help reduce disease risk, like poly- and mono-unsaturated vegetable oils, nuts, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish and others,” Sacks said."
50,http://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/what-keeps-modern-dads-night-ncna773101,nbcnews,Move over 'mom guilt' -- now it's dad's turn,[],"Dads these days are more involved with their children than ever before… and as this Father's Day rolls around, they might be more conflicted about their role than any previous generation of fathers.

An online survey of more than 1,200 dads conducted by TODAY.com in partnership with Fatherly.com found that modern dads are navigating challenges like “dad guilt” and “stay-at-home dad envy” — concepts their own fathers would scarcely recognize.

Nearly two-thirds of working dads surveyed (63 percent) said they envy stay-at-home dads.

And, we found out how many are secretly hiding in the bathroom instead of helping out with the kids.

Dad Guilt: It's A Thing

About one in five (19 percent) said they feel guilt about not being “present” enough with their children and 17 percent said they suffer from “dad guilt” about working too much.

But dads still feel that traditional pressure to be the breadwinner. About one in four (28 percent) reported they feel “dad guilt” about not making enough money to provide for their family the way they’d like to.

“That’s the dilemma” of modern fatherhood, said Joshua David Stein, the editor-at-large of Fatherly and father of two sons. Of course, he noted, working moms have been feeling this push-and-pull between career and family for decades now — and dads are just catching up. In a way, he said, the torn feelings of dads represent progress.

Doyin Richards felt guilty about missing out on time with his children when he worked a corporate job. ""I spent the majority of my days wishing I was at home with my young daughters,"" Richards said. So he left the 9-5 office life to be a stay-at-home, work-at-home dad, and said he never looked back. ""It was easily the best decision I've ever made in my life.""

Asked whether they’d rather get to spend more time with their children or get a raise at work, dads were evenly split, with 51 percent choosing more family time and 49 percent opting for the raise.

On the Other Hand, Dad guilt? What's That?

But not all dads are agonizing over their life choices. In fact, they’re a pretty cheerful bunch overall. A quarter of dads (26 percent) said they don’t feel dad guilt at all — they do their best, and they don’t feel bad about it — a refreshing attitude.

Working moms have been feeling this push-and-pull between career and family for decades now — and dads are just catching up.

Richards said he understands the lack of guilt. ""Now that I left my corporate job, I don't feel any dad guilt whatsoever because my schedule is flexible enough to spend as much time with my daughters as I would like,"" he said. ""On the flip side, I bet there are some dads who are never at home due to work commitments and also don't feel any dad guilt because they believe making money is what they're supposed to do for their families.""

Fathers are not too worried about what others think of them, either. More than half (56 percent) say they don't feel judged by other parents for their parenting choices. Among those who DO feel judged, dads are 14 times as likely to say they feel judged by moms than by other dads.

When it comes to pulling their weight at home, 50 percent of dads say their partner does more of the childcare than they do but only 10 percent feel guilty about not contributing more at home. Half of dads say they “never” hide or feign incompetence to avoid childcare, while 26 percent admit they sometimes pull the old “hide in the bathroom trick,” a very honest three percent said they do it “often,” and 21 percent said “just that one time.” Suuuuuuure… we know the truth now!

""I don't care if you're a mom or a dad, we've all done the 'hide in the bathroom trick,'"" Richards said. ""Many parents try to act as if they're above this sort of thing, but most of us aren't (myself included). Just own it and understand that it's part of parenting.""

Pepe’s inventor, artist and illustrator Matt Furie, drew the green frog in an open casket as part of a one-page strip for publisher Fantagraphics Books on Saturday marking Free Comic Book Day.

Furie also posted an image on his Tumblr showing the frog in the casket, linking to an article on Comic Book Resources announcing the character's demise.

Cartoonist Matt Furie laid to rest Pepe the Frog. Matt Furie

""While it’s unlikely Pepe’s official death will stop extremists from co-opting his image, this was, perhaps, the most effective way for Furie to reclaim his character; Pepe’s soul has returned to his creator. Rest in Peace,"" CBR author Shaun Manning said in the post.

The frog began as a harmless cartoon in 2005, Furie has said, in the Fantagraphics' comic book “Boy’s Club.” Pepe gained popularity over the next few years online as a meme before his more recent association with white supremacists, neo-Nazi groups and the so-called “alt-right.”

The Anti-Defamation League launched a #SavePepe campaign in October, in an attempt to reclaim the positive message originally behind the meme. Pepe the Frog had previously been declared a hate symbol by the ADL.

Furie said in a post on TIME’s website the day before the campaign was launched that it was “completely insane that Pepe has been labeled a symbol of hate, and that racists and anti-Semites are using a once peaceful frog-dude from my comic book as an icon of hate.”

The ADL said that while cartoon’s origins were inoffensive, it had been increasingly appropriated for “bigoted themes” in ""a tendency exacerbated by the controversial and contentious 2016 presidential election.""

I admit, it’s not as easy as ordering in from the local pizza joint, but the effort you put in can really pay off on your waistline and long-term wellness. One study from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Research found that meals cooked at home are healthier, with home chefs who cook most often consuming fewer calories, carbohydrates and sugar compared to those who report cooking the least. In this study, people who reported participating in meal prep six or seven nights a week — I know, a lot! — also made healthier choices on the occasions they ate out. Cooking at home has also been linked to higher consumption of fruits and veggies — both fresh and otherwise — a factor that is key to optimizing your health.

To get you more excited about meal prep, I’ve asked some of the nation’s leading dietitians—food pros who know their way around healthy eating—for their go-to kitchen gadgets that make meal prep as easy as possible. Happy cooking!

1. Microplane

Rachel Begun, MS, RDN, nutrition advocate and certified natural chef in Los Angeles, CA, loves her many microplanes! “The microplane is a small investment that delivers big flavor to everyday meals. It grates citrus rinds, ginger, turmeric, hard cheeses, and whole spices, such as nutmeg and cinnamon. It also shaves chocolate for the perfect desert topping. The best part is that when you grate or shave these ingredients, a little amount goes a long way to flavor foods,” she explains.

Begun recommends using the tool in her summery recipe for Strawberry Lemon Shortbread Cookies. “It uses lemon zest to add zing to the cream, which is a nice balance to the sweet strawberries and vanilla shortbread,” she says.

Julie Harrington, RD, Culinary Nutrition Consultant in Morristown, NJ is also a fan of this small but mighty tool. She uses it to make quick work of grating to add flavor and freshness to dishes like her Crepes with a Strawberry Lemon Ricotta Filling and Broccoli & Cauliflower Salad.

2. Veggie Spiralizer

Chef Julie Andrews, MS, RD, CD in Madison, WI can’t live without her spiralizer. This gadget is useful for turning veggies — from zucchini to beets — into noodle-like strands. Though I typically use it to create a stand-in for pasta, she shows you how to create Crispy Beet and Sweet Potato Fries, a vibrant, nutrition-packed, and lighter take on traditional curly fries. I think even picky eaters (read: kids) will try this colorful creation.

3. Stand Mixer

All of my foodie friends swear by this small countertop appliance — even those living in New York City apartments with tight kitchens. Sara Hass, RDN, Culinary Nutritionist in Chicago, IL could not agree more. “I would love to say I could mix everything by hand all of the time, but time won’t allow for that. Not when I work from home while managing my little sous chef! My stand mixer makes my life easier and cooking and baking more efficient,” she says. Trust her and try using this timesaving tool in her lightened up baked goodies like Toasted Coconut Cupcakes, Super Easy Graham Cracker Pancakes, and Banana Coconut Bundt Cake.

4. Food Brush

“I can’t live without my food brush,” says Keri Gans, RDN, Nutritionist in New York City and author of The Small Change Diet. Sometimes people go a little crazy with the oil when grilling, but Gans recommends brushing fish, chicken, veggies, or sliced potatoes with a little oil instead. “I brush just a little amount to perfectly cover both sides before adding herbs and spices,” she says. Also known as a silicone basting brush, Gans swears this handy helper will reduce clean-up time, too. “Before I discovered this gadget, I was using my fingers and this is far easier and a whole lot less messy!”

5. Ginger Grater

“I love ginger for its anti-inflammatory effects and ability to open up sinuses and boost circulation and metabolism. But I also love the flavor,” says Cynthia Sass MPH, RD, CSSD, in New York City and author of Slim Down Now. “I add fresh grated ginger to nearly everything, including iced water, homemade salad dressing, marinades, and stir fry sauces; fold it into nut butter; blend it into smoothies and puddings; and stir it into melted dark chocolate,” she explains.

My mouth is watering at the thought of melted dark chocolate with fresh grated ginger, but Sass also uses the spice in savory foods. “Combine ginger with ground cinnamon to season lentil soup and oven roasted chickpeas,” she suggests. “It's one of my top my can't-live-without ingredients, and my grater makes super easy to prepare.”

Try her Cherry Chocolate Green Goddess Smoothie made with—what else?—fresh, grated ginger.

6. Small Kitchen Scoop

Dawn Jackson Blatner, RDN in Chicago, IL and author of The Superfood Swap recommends this mini ice cream-style scooper for a “clean, easy, and portioned way to make everything from healthy cookies to lentil meatballs to energy bites.”

“As a registered dietitian nutritionist, I love that it adds an element of portion control, but it also makes your recipes look totally professional,” she explains. Another claim to fame for the small kitchen scoop: Jackson Blatner uses it in the CUBS clubhouse to scoop sticky things like nut butters, coconut oil, and raw honey into protein shakes without making a mess.

Her PB & Flax Energy Bites are packed with good-for-you ingredients and she offers clever ideas for enjoying them, like using the bites atop your favorite smoothie. At this point I’m wondering how I have managed to live without this tool. (Thank goodness for Amazon Prime!)

7. Citrus Reamer

“To provide balance in a recipe, such as balancing bitterness, I often rely on culinary acids, especially lemon juice,” explains Jackie Newgent, RDN, culinary nutritionist in Brooklyn, NY, and author of The All-Natural Diabetes Cookbook. “The fastest and easiest way to get fresh juice from ‘produce to plate’ is by using a citrus reamer!”

Newgent’s in-season Orzo, Greens & Pan-Charred Corn Salad makes use of this low-investment kitchen item. I have a feeling this is one gizmo that won’t get lost in the back of the drawer!

8. Nutribullet

Alissa Rumsey, MS, RD, author of Three Steps to a Healthier You, loves the versatility of this blender. “I use it to make smoothies, chop nuts, grind spices, make nut butter, and turn rolled oats into oat flour,” she says. Need some recipe inspo? Her Powered-Up Smoothie Bowl is a fun and flavorful way to pack in seasonal produce.

Alexis Joseph, MS, RD, LD, Founder of Hummusapien.com and Co-Founder of Alchemy in Columbus, OH is another fan of the Nutribullet. Her pretty-in-pink Grapefruit Smoothie Bowl has an always-in-season surprise: frozen cauliflower florets. What a creative way to boost fiber and nutrients!

Kaleigh McMordie, MCN, RD, intuitive eating dietitian in Lubbock, TX, also swears by this multi-purpose appliance. “It’s easier to clean than a blender, and a little less bulky than many appliances. I especially love it when I only need to make a small batch of something, such as salsa,” she says. Take her word for it and whip up a batch of fresh Roasted Garlic Hummus. Slice up some summery zucchini and dip away!

9. Mandoline

When it comes to making quick prep of shredding and slicing veggies, Kara Lydon, RD, LDN, RYT, Intuitive Eating Dietitian and Yoga Teacher based in Boston turns to her mandoline. “I love using it to make coleslaw, veggie ribbons for salads, and veggie chips and fries! This gadget comes in especially handy when making my Dehydrated Parmesan Truffle Zucchini Chips, perfect for this time of year while zucchini is abundant at farmer's markets,” she notes.

10. Chef’s Knife

No kitchen would be complete without this essential, according to McMordie. “Having a great Chef's knife really eliminates the need for a bunch of other tools in the kitchen.” So true! You’ll want to grab the cutting board and sharpen your knife for this stunning Summery Strawberry Peach Burrata Salad."

Obdulia Sánchez, 18, of Stockton, was behind the wheel of a 2003 Buick when the vehicle veered onto the right shoulder of the road in Los Banos, near Modesto, on Friday, the California Highway Patrol said. She overcorrected, causing the vehicle to swerve across lanes, crash through a wire fence and overturn into a field, authorities said.

Sánchez's 14-year-old sister, Jacqueline Sánchez Estrada, was killed, and another 14-year-old passenger was injured in her leg. Neither was wearing a seatbelt, investigators said.

Sánchez pleaded not guilty by video Wednesday afternoon in Merced County Superior Court to a count of gross vehicular manslaughter, a count of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, two counts of driving under the influence resulting in injury and two counts of driving with an elevated blood alcohol content causing injury. She was ordered held on $560,000 bail pending a bond hearing on Friday and a preliminary hearing on Aug. 9.

In a video posted on Instagram, Sánchez is seen outside the car with what appears to be Jacqueline's body. The other teen can be seen trying to wave down help.

""I f-----g killed my sister, OK? I know I’m going to jail for life,"" Sánchez says in the video. ""This is the last thing I wanted to happen, OK? I don""t f-----g care, though. I'm going to hold it down. Rest in peace, sweetie. If you don't survive, I am so f-----g sorry.""

Chief Deputy District Attorney Harold Nutt said the driving violations carried enhanced ""great bodily damage"" penalties. If she's convicted, Sánchez could face as long as 13 years and eight months in state prison.

""Certainly, anybody can say very easily that she is responsible for the death. She believes that, too,"" Ramnik Samrao, Sánchez's public defender, told reporters after the hearing. ""She's said multiple times, for anybody that's seen the video: 'I killed my sister. I killed my sister.'

""So there's no doubt about that,"" Samrao said. ""But whether a crime was actually committed, that's a separate story.""

Samrao urged people to imagine what they would do if they were ever in Sánchez's situation.

""I think it's absolutely unfortunate that so many people would rush to judge her on a few minutes of her life, not having known anything about her,"" he said. ""Nobody knows how they would react when your sibling dies in your arms."""

Angelina Jolie is a woman who is not afraid to speak openly about her health. In 2013, Jolie underwent a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery after testing positive for the BRCA1 gene, mutations of the gene increase a woman's lifetime risk for developing breast and ovarian cancer. In March 2015, she had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed.

Today, the actress turned director is sharing new information about her health: According to Vanity Fair, last year, Jolie was diagnosed with hypertension (high blood pressure) and Bell's palsy.

""Sometimes women in families put themselves last, until it manifests itself in their own health,"" she told the magazine.

The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke defines Bell's palsy as a form of temporary facial paralysis resulting from damage or trauma to the facial nerves. Bell's palsy affects the function of the facial nerve, causing an interruption in the messages the brain sends to the muscles in the face, leading to weakness or paralysis in the area.

According to Dr. Matthew Hirsch, a facial plastic and reconstructive surgeon at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, it almost always occurs on one side of the face, but can happen on both.

""It's not uncommon, and is more common in those who are 15 to 40 years old,"" Hirsch said. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke reports that it afflicts approximately 40,000 Americans each year.

Hirsch noted that while trauma to the face, surgeries and ear infections can result in facial weakness, they wouldn't cause Bell's palsy. The condition is medically defined as a weakness of the face without an identifiable cause. Most in the medical profession believe that a virus causes it, but that has not been proven.

""Bell's palsy refers to a specific scenario where the patient experiences a fairly rapid onset of weakness of both the upper and lower face, without any identifiable cause. This frequently occurs within 72 hours,"" Hirsch explained.

Most people think they've had a stroke, he added.

Patients should visit a doctor as soon as they recognize the weakness or paralysis. Prescribed treatment is typically oral steroids and anti-viral medications, which greatly increase the odds of a full recovery.

Even without treatment, up to two-thirds of people will have a normal return to function.

""It can take six months to a year for the nerve to recover as much as it's going to recover,"" Hirsch said.

Hirsch said there are a lot of options for people with an incomplete recovery, including:

physical therapy

Botox

surgical options, ranging from small procedures to bring symmetry to the resting face, to bigger surgeries where nerve grafts are taken from other parts of the body, and muscle transfers, to make the mouth move again.

Jolie told Vanity Fair that she has recovered from the condition, thanks to acupuncture, although Hirsch said there's not enough evidence to recommend the treatment, ""one way or another.""

""A lot of my patients have already had acupuncture done. (Their) opinion is mixed,"" Hirsch said.

There is one crucial piece of advice for patients with an incomplete recovery, or those who have had a full recovery, but still have issues with their facial functions: See a specialist.

""If they are diagnosed with it, or not given a clear diagnosis, I'd recommend seeing someone who specializes in this condition (like a facial plastic surgeon) to receive appropriate treatment and management,"" Hirsch warned, stressing that a lot of doctors are unaware of all the options for patients."

Eisenstein'],"Starting a new work week can be grueling. But what if you could tap a button on your smartphone to have a car pull up moments later, you slip inside, falling into a plush recliner like the one you wish you had in your living room. Within moments, you’re catching a little extra sleep while the driverless vehicle navigates its way to your office.

That might seem like a scene out of a science fiction movie, but it’s likely to become reality sooner than you realize. In Phoenix, Google spin-off Waymo is already letting residents participate in a pilot ride-sharing program using a small fleet of self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans.

The first fully autonomous vehicles are expected to go on sale by 2020, and completely driverless models may follow by as early as 2022, according to plans laid out by both Ford and Daimler.

The convergence of self-driving vehicles and ride-sharing services will do more than make commuting easier, according to a new study by computer tech giant Intel. It envisions these emerging technologies will transform the nation as radically as the arrival of the original automobile did early in the 20th Century — in the process creating a “passenger economy” that will generate revenues of as much as $7 trillion by 2050.

From Driver to Rider

We are heading towards a situation where “we humans become riders, instead of drivers,” said Doug Davis, an Intel vice president and co-author of the new study. “At the end of the day, this presents a huge opportunity.”

It’s often said that the automobile has shaped the face of America, allowing the creation of the nation’s sprawling suburbs and creating a vast network of drive-through restaurants, malls, and gas stations. We’ve already begun seeing a modest return to urban living as Americans grow tired of long, slow commutes. But the new transportation era could trigger even more population shifts.

By making it easier and more affordable to get around without having to have a home with a garage, it could encourage more people to return to cities. On the other hand, autonomous vehicles are expected to make roads safer and flow more smoothly, which might encourage more people to move even further out into exurbs and rural areas.

“We could see a situation where people are (quite) willing to commute several hours a day,” said Greg Lindsay, one of the survey participants and a senior fellow at the non-profit New Cities Foundation, during an Intel conference call.

Various studies issued this year, including ones from consultancies Boston Consulting Group and RethinkX, have projected that by 2030 anywhere from 25 percent to as much as 95 percent of the miles Americans travel by road will be done in driverless, electrified vehicles operated by ride-sharing services.

No More Car Payments

The BCG study estimated that in many parts of the country, within the next decade or two, it will cost less than half as much to use a driverless ride-sharing service as it would to own a car. One of the other advantages is that this will democratize transportation, especially in poorer communities where residents often find it difficult to get good jobs because they can’t afford a car and don’t have access to mass transit.

But here's where Intel’s study pokes at the great unknown. Just as the arrival of the Model T encouraged roadside services to pop up and grab commuters and suburbanites going from Point A to Point B, might entrepreneurs come up with a whole new landscape of mobility-as-a-service opportunities, the authors ask.

Related: Self-Driving Cars Will Turn Intersections Into High-Speed Ballet

If they aren’t driving, passengers would be able to nap, play, dine or put in a little extra work time. But the study anticipates the possibility that instead of just summoning up a generic Uber or Lyft a passenger could have a ride-sharing vehicle pull up at the end of the workday with a hot meal waiting, or their shopping all done and waiting in the trunk, perhaps even a stylist to give you a haircut or a manicure and pedicure on the way home.

The $7 trillion figure forecast for mobility services in 2050 breaks down into

$3.7 trillion, or 55 percent, for consumer services

$3 trillion, or 43 percent, for business-to-business services, such as office supply deliveries

$203 billion for other new vehicle-related services and features.

So What Happens to Detroit?

One of the other big questions is who will benefit from the emergence of the passenger economy? Today, carmakers are focused on selling sheet metal, and traditional manufacturers — such as Ford, Toyota and Volkswagen — likely will continue to produce a major share of the cars on the road. But how many cars will be needed is unclear. Recently ousted Ford CEO Mark Fields, a proponent of the passenger economy, said he expects sales could drop sharply over the next 10 to 15 years as ride-sharing catches on.

To make up for lost revenue, said the Intel report, “Carmakers may ultimately vie (with services like Lyft and Uber) to operate particular networks of vehicles for particular cities.” And they will focus more on generating service business than manufacturing and car sales.

But new players, including up-start carmakers like Tesla, tech firms like Waymo, and ride-sharing firms like Uber and Lyft, all will be seeking to dominate, or at least grab a piece of this huge new economic pie.

Whoever comes to lead the new passenger economy, it “will reconfigure time and then space, to some extent, and will ultimately lead to changes in land use and services,” said Lindsay, resulting in “a massive reconfiguring of the U.S.”"
62,http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/anti-semitism-claims-hound-u-k-s-labour-party-despite-n781621,nbcnews,Anti-Semitism Claims Hound U.K.’s Labour Party Despite Rise in Polls,['Rachel Elbaum'],"LONDON — Britain’s Labour Party is riding high in the polls, but some of its most loyal members find themselves wavering in their support because of what they see as an increase in anti-Semitism that they consider to be linked to the party.

Take Steve, who voted for Labour in every election since coming of age, campaigned for the party many times and helped run his local branch.

Still, the 45-year-old psychologist says his hand hesitated over the ballot as he got ready to vote in the last election in June.

“This was the first time in my life that I’ve struggled to vote for Labour — I’ve been a proud member of the party my entire life,” said Steve, from the northern town of Derby, who asked that his full name not be used for fear of retaliation in his local party.

Steve paused before voting for Labour because of what he sees as an increase of anti-Semitism both online and in real life under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, a socialist who has seen newfound prestige thanks to his party’s better-than-expected results in the summer's national election.

""There are members of my local branch that now won't speak with me because they know I'm Jewish,"" he said. ""This was never the case and only started in the last two years.""

A survey conducted just before the election by polling company Survation and The Jewish Chronicle newspaper found that Labour held the backing of only 13 percent of British Jews. In recent years, the party has come under criticism for its leader's past ties with anti-Israel groups, and what they say is light discipline of members who have made anti-Semitic comments.

Corbyn’s office didn’t respond to requests for a comment for this article.

'An occasionally toxic atmosphere'

“There’s a certain section of his supporters, not all of them, that really struggle to understand that you can be a Jew and in the party and also support Israel without being a supporter of the right wing,” said Hannah, who asked that her name not be used for fear for her safety. “It’s black and white to them. If you have any sympathy for Israel, they are triggered and can’t control themselves.”

Hannah said that since Corbyn became the Labour Party's leader in 2015, she has received “countless” anti-Semitic messages on social media, including a particularly distressing photo of a man with a knife in his back and the caption, “Serves him right, he trusted a k---,"" using racial slur for someone of Jewish descent.

The party itself appears to be taking these fears seriously, commissioning a report into anti-Semitism in April 2016. It found that there was “an occasionally toxic atmosphere” in the party, but that it “is not overrun by anti-Semitism, Islamophobia or other forms of racism.”

Yet the concerns are persistent, marking a sharp departure for Labour, which has repeatedly sponsored legislation promoting equality in the U.K., including on pay, gender and religion.

For most of its history, Labour was the most pro-Jewish and pro-Zionist of all the major political parties in the country, according to Daniel Allington, a professor of sociology at Leicester University who researches the rise of anti-Semitism on the left.

However, over the past three years, its leadership has been more critical of Israel's policies, and Corbyn has said that he would immediately recognize a state of Palestine if he became prime minister, which some see as dangerous if it came with no political conditions attached.

Corbyn's controversial 'friends'

Corbyn himself used to be a millstone around the Labour Party’s neck — in June 2016, a majority of his own legislators in Parliament passed a motion of no confidence in the vain hope that he would quit.

Now, the opposition leader, who is strongly against nuclear weapons and who believes in the re-nationalization of the railways and other public services, has helped his party overtake the Conservative Party in the polls. The most recent YouGov poll showed an 8-point lead for Labour.

In addition to accusations that Corbyn hasn’t cracked down hard enough on hostility to Jews, he himself has a mixed history with the Jewish community. Reading through his past comments about Israel — which plays a strong role in the identity of many British Jews — is jarring in comparison to comments by other political leaders, past and present.

At the unveiling of the report into anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, Corbyn seemed to compare Israel to the ISIS terror group, shocking many of his own Labour legislators.

“The Jewish community was seeing [anti-Semitic incidents] as a course of conduct and Labour was seeing it as isolated events”

“Our Jewish friends are no more responsible for the actions of Israel or the [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu government than our Muslim friends are for those various self-styled Islamic states or organisations,"" he said at the event.

A bigger issue for many was Corbyn’s invitation to representatives of Hamas and Hezbollah to an event in Parliament in 2009, when he was a rebellious Labour MP and not in the government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Both groups are classified by the U.K. and U.S. as terrorist groups, and have repeatedly called for the destruction of the State of Israel.

At the time, he called the groups “friends,” while also commenting that they’re “dedicated toward the good of the Palestinian people and bringing about long-term peace and social justice and political justice.”

After becoming Labour leader he said he regretted calling them “friends.”

In addition, his paid appearances before he became leader on Iran-owned Press TV, a station now banned in the U.K., have won him few admirers in the Jewish community.

“I don’t believe for a minute that Jeremy Corbyn is an anti-Semite,” said Harry Fletcher, a former Corbyn adviser who helped with his 2015 leadership campaign. “It’s an institutional thing. It’s not conscious. It’s mixed up with the left of the party, which has complete antipathy to State of Israel and many would say that it shouldn’t exist.”

Tumultuous time for party

Corbyn’s newfound popularity comes after a tumultuous two years in the party, including the suspensions of high-profile Labour politicians, such as powerful former London Mayor Ken Livingstone.

In April 2016, Livingstone insisted that Adolf Hitler supported Zionism. He was suspended from holding office in the party for two years, angering some who felt the punishment was too lenient and who wanted him expelled.

Meanwhile, in February 2016, the head of the Oxford University Labour Club resigned, describing “poisonous” attitudes among certain members of the club. He recounted members of the executive “throwing around the term ‘Zio,’” a slur for Zionists, and a former co-chair saying that “most accusations of anti-Semitism are just the Zionists crying wolf.”

A Labour Party investigation into the club found that there had been “some incidents of anti-Semitic behavior.”

Among those reporting anti-Semitic abuse were several Jewish members of Parliament, including Louise Ellman, who represents Liverpool Riverside. Not long after Corbyn took power, Ellman faced rowdy meetings in her district, with pro-Corbyn party members reportedly making anti-Semitic remarks and attacking her position on Israel.

She said the party is investigating the events.

“There are some individuals engaging in traditional anti-Semitism, such as making references to Jews financing slavery, and others who are anti-Zionist to the degree that they become associated with people who denigrate Jews as a whole,” said Ellman on the phone from her office in Parliament.

“Anti-Semitism is of concern, but there are many in the party who are outraged about what’s happening,” she added.

Influential voting bloc

To understand how extraordinary it is for a particular group to feel alienated from Labour, one must look at the party’s history.

Labour has traditionally stood against discrimination and many of its most influential members and vocal supporters have been Jewish. There are scores of former and current Jewish Labour members of Parliament, including former party leader Ed Milliband, who has Jewish heritage, but grew up an atheist.

And while there are only around 250,000 Jews in Britain today, their influence at the ballot box may be significant when no political party has an outright majority in Parliament.

According to an analysis by Allington, the sociology professor, there was a statistical relationship between a constituency’s Jewish population and its swing to the Labour candidate in this past election, belying trends in similar areas.

“The higher [an area’s] Jewish population, the lower the rise in the Labour vote this election,” he said. “If just two seats had gone the other way — with things being so finely balanced — it would have been much harder for the Conservative Party to form a government.”

The Conservative Party is eight seats short of a majority in Parliament and needed to secure the agreement of a small party from Northern Ireland to get their governing agenda through Parliament last month.

One of the main problems, according to Fletcher, is that Corbyn acknowledges individual incidents of anti-Semitism but does not see them as part of systemic problem.

“The Jewish community was seeing [anti-Semitic incidents] as a course of conduct and Labour was seeing it as isolated events,” said Fletcher. “They saw it as a pattern which led them to conclude that there must be deep-rooted anti-Semitism with Corbyn and the Labour Party, and he saw it as incidents he dealt with.”

'A lot more needs to be done'

With Corbyn and his left-wing of the party looking firmly entrenched for the foreseeable future, there does seem to be a desire to find a new working relationship between Labour and the Jewish community.

“Since the election the [inter-Labour] factional fight has died down a bit, and hopefully that will open space for trust, engagement and reconciliation on both sides,” said Alex Nunns, author of the upcoming book “The Candidate: Jeremy Corbyn's Improbable Path to Power.”

The Jewish Leadership Council, as well as the office of Shadow Minister Dawn Butler, who is responsible for interacting with minority communities on behalf of the Labour Party, declined to comment — noting that while discussions are ongoing they aren’t ready to speak publicly yet.

Despite what seems like a public détente between Corbyn, his supporters, and the Jewish community at the moment, Ellman notes there is still a lot of work to do to fight anti-Semitism in the party.

“There is a greater understanding of the nature of the problem,” said Ellman. “It’s an ongoing issue. It is changing slowly, but a lot more needs to be done.”"

Collins'],"From beloved classics like ""The Notebook"" and ""Pride and Prejudice"" — some romance novels have hit the big screen with a passion, satisfying book and film lovers alike.

Best-selling author, Beverly Jenkins is next in line, hoping her story “Deadly Sexy” can make some waves in the romantic film genre.

Author of over 35 books and novellas, “Ms. Bev,” as readers affectionately call her, has teamed up with Iris Bolling, CEO of Siri Austin Entertainment, to raise funds to produce her film. Bolling is also an award-winning author who turned her book series “The Heart” into a television production.

Jenkins adds to her collection of historical and contemporary multicultural romance novels with ""Deadly Sexy,"" a story based on a rich, smart and beautiful sports agent, Jessi Teresa — known as JT.

JT, never one to be considered a damsel in distress, finds herself in need of help when her Lexus breaks down on the California freeway. Reese Anthony, a trucker and former cop, comes to her aid.

While Alice Walker’s ""The Color Purple,"" Zora Neale Hurston’s ""Their Eyes Were Watching God,"" Toni Morrison’s ""Beloved"" and more recently, Steve Harvey’s ""Think Like A Man,"" are books that have transitioned to successful feature films — this is an industry rarity. Many Black romance novels are bound by the paper and hardback covers they’re given and their stories are never told three dimensionally.

With a GoFundMe page, a goal of $100,000 and only 30 days to reach it, Jenkins and Bolling have called on fans for their support.

“We’ve been waiting on Hollywood to green-light us for forever but no one seems very interested in our love stories—you don’t see us on the Hallmark channel, you don’t see us on Lifetime,"" Jenkins said in her GoFundMe video. ""So I would hope that the more authors that do collaborate and go ahead and green-light their own projects will get the cable folks and other people who do mainstream films curious about what we’re doing.”

On Twitter, fans of the franchise could not contain their excitement and tweeted with the hashtags #DeadlySexy and #DeadlySexyTheMovie.

“We’re trying to be very very creative about how to let the readers in, they can be in walk-in scenes, they can even audition for a part if they want,” added Jenkins, who is also the recipient of the 2017 Romance Writers of America Nora Roberts Lifetime Achievement Award.

“This has been a dream of mine since reading my first Beverly Jenkins novel. Contact me if you need help on your crew. I'm studying filmmaking in Detroit and would love to help,” wrote one woman who donated to the “Deadly Sexy - The Movie” fund.

Supporters can donate anywhere from $25, and receive a thank you letter from Beverly Jenkins, to $10,000, and receive VIP tickets to the film screening.

The money raised will go directly to the production of the film including cast, crew and equipment.

Siri Austin Entertainment prides itself on being a “gateway for authors to share their talents with the world through various mediums such as books and film.” Their first TV series ""The Heart,"" based on the novel written by Iris Bolling, has 2 seasons available on DVD. The production company's upcoming projects include ""Deadly Sexy"" and ""Night of Seduction"" by Iris Bolling.

Jenkins' fans are not the only ones showing their support. Her friends are supporting her as well, with personal videos posted on “Deadly Sexy - The Movie” GoFundMe page. A Grammy award-winning artist, book store owners, and author Katharine Ashe who gives her “Top 10 Reasons Why Beverly Jenkins Books Should Be Movies,"" have filmed video pleas.

Jenkins and Bolling believe that the production of ""Deadly Sexy"" “will give hope to those who dream of having their book made into a film.”

It seems emojis, those expressive pictures all over texts and Instagram, could actually help our love lives. In his new book, “The Emoji Code,” to be published in the U.S. in August by MacMillan Picador, British linguist Vyv Evans argues that emojis are making us better communicators.

Evans calls emojis a “near-universal form of communication,” replacing internet slang like LOL with the popular “face with tears of joy” emoji.

And while he says some see the little glyphs as “little more than an adolescent grunt,” Evans says those people couldn’t be more wrong.

Evans’ research found that 72 percent of 18- to 25-year-olds find it easier to express their emotions if they’re using emojis. And 80 percent of people in the U.K. said they use them.

There’s a reason for that: Digital communication has stripped away important context like gestures, facial expressions and tone of voice. Emails and texts often come across as more ambiguous — or mean-spirited — than intended.

Enter the emoji. Adding a little smiley face or winking eye can convey joking or sarcasm. A text that says “Sure, go ahead!” with a kissy face could read more like “sure … go ahead” without one.

A Match.com survey of singles in America found that people who use emojis went on more dates and were more likely to have sex than those who didn’t. More than half of singles who used emojis had sex in 2014, compared to 31 percent of singles who didn’t, according to the survey.

""Bad way to go,"" a character from the swords-and-sorcery show says during this week's season premiere.

Throughout history, death by burning has been portrayed as one of the worst ways to go. It makes for horror-inducing scenes not only on ""Game of Thrones,"" but also during episodes of PBS' ""Wolf Hall"" docudrama about King Henry VIII and the medieval milieu of 16th-century England.

As medieval as it sounds, death by burning is still a phenomenon in the 21st century — to such an extent that the physiology can be studied by forensic scientists. The victims range from the Jordanian jet pilot who was killed by ISIS terrorists this year, to the Africans and Haitians targeted by the practice known as ""necklacing,"" to January's killing of a newborn in New Jersey.

The conventional wisdom is that most fire deaths are caused by asphyxiation rather than the burning itself — but Valerie Rao, chief medical examiner for the city of Jacksonville, Florida, said that's not always the case for an execution-style burning.

""It depends on how fast this happens,"" Rao told NBC News. ""If you are burned to death, it's basically the burns that cause the death.""

Grim effects

Rao's analysis of the ""Forensic Pathology of Thermal Injuries"" for Medscape makes for difficult reading, and even more difficult viewing. The flesh is burned black, with ""skin splits"" exposing soft tissue. The effects of the heat on muscles warp the body into a boxer's ""pugilistic"" attitude. Black soot clogs the airway.

Historical accounts of the burning of Joan of Arc suggest that she died of smoke inhalation, but add that her body had to be set aflame two more times to burn it down completely to ash.

Other accounts report that the victims of a death-by-burning sentence were sometimes given the option of being strangled first, to spare them the extreme pain associated with the burning of the air passages. Yet another option involved tying a small barrel of gunpowder to the prisoners, to give them a quick and merciful death when the flames licked up.

Practical lessons

During her 35 years of forensic work, including 19 years in Miami, Rao has seen the effects of death by burning on drivers trapped in fiery automobile collisions, the targets of drug-related car bombings, and the victims of necklacing inflicted by bad elements in Florida's Haitian community.

""Initially it's sad,"" she said. ""But after a while, you say to yourself, 'If I'm going to do this, I'm going to have to separate the emotion from the work.'""

Are there any lessons to be learned by TV viewers who are getting a sanitized look at the grisly phenomenon? For Rao, the takeaways are far more pedestrian than Jon Snow's exploits on ""Game of Thrones,"" but also far more realistic: Install carbon monoxide detectors and smoke alarms in your home, change their batteries regularly, and don't use gas-powered generators or barbecues indoors.

""Those are very useful lessons that we've learned,"" Rao said.

Bennett never let her lack of design experience and business know-how hold her back. “I had fabrics and I had dreams and I had ideas,” said Bennett.

Fast forward five years, and Hedley & Bennett’s high-end, hand-crafted aprons have a fan base that stretches across 4,000 kitchens in the country. Celebrity chefs like Martha Stewart and Mario Batali have also been spotted wearing these vibrant, stand-out designs.

From the hardware to the fabrics, fashion in the food space has never looked better. “Teams are feeling way better and are more on brand,” says Bennett. “It’s like put this on, hold your head up high, and do a damn good job today.”

Her collection of what she calls “proper bad-ass aprons,” are created in a 14,000 square-foot workspace that is equipped with two tree houses and a zip line. When people stop by for a visit, Bennett says she often hears, “it’s like Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.”

The whimsical wonderland is bursting with creativity and bubbling with spirit, but make no mistake about it. This CEO is all about getting down to business. “That mentality of working with a sense of urgency really is a game changer, especially when you have a start-up.”

Bennett’s company is also serious about shining a spotlight on other innovators and start-ups in her industry. Not only does she open her factory doors to host events for brands like Shake Shack, but Bennett also likes to introduce products from other companies with every Hedley & Bennett shipment. “It’s connecting the community and being willing to share that platform. I think it’s awesome and I want to help my community grow.”

Already, Bennett has developed limited edition lines for big names like Sur la Table and Bon Appétit, and most recently, RED, a non-profit started by U2 front man Bono. “We’re growing together and doing something bigger and better for everybody.”"

A large review has found a 40-year plunge in sperm count, specifically in men from North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand — and the reason may be associated with common factors in our daily lives.

Scientists from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and Icahn School of Medicine in New York analyzed 185 studies from 1973 to 2011, including almost 43,000 men. The results were stunning: Researchers found a 52 percent decline in sperm concentration and a 59 percent decline in total sperm count.

The meta-analysis published in the Oxford University journal, Human Reproduction Update, shows that the continued decline doesn’t appear to be leveling off, raising questions about the future of male reproductive health in western males.

“It’s extremely worrisome,"" Dr. Shanna Swan, study author and professor of environmental medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine told NBC News. “For couples who are trying to conceive, this is a very severe problem and it’s difficult psychologically, but in the big scheme of things, this is also a major public health issue.”

The new paper doesn’t give reasons for the decline.

But Swan says falling sperm counts have been linked to exposure to certain chemicals, especially for unborn boys in the womb.

“For example, a pregnant mother’s smoking has a more devastating effect on her son’s future sperm count than a man smoking as an adult,"" says Swan.

The same concept may also apply to other chemicals known as “endocrine disrupters” — substances found all over the world in water, soil and some foods. It has been hypothesized that these substances can find their way into male fetuses, disrupting hormones, potentially increasing the risk for future fertility problems. Studies are under way to establish a conclusive link between these chemicals and fertility.

But sperm count has broader health implications than just fertility.

“Male fertility predicts overall men’s health”, says Dr. Joseph Alukal, urologist and director of male reproductive health at NYU Langone Health. Studies have shown that lower sperm counts may predict shorter life expectancy and are associated with heart attacks.

What about Tighty Whities?

Cause-and-effect is unclear at this point, said Alukal. But there are culprits of modern life that both lower sperm count and increase the risk for other common health conditions: a sedentary lifestyle, often accompanied by a poor diet.

Brown, 18, was black and unarmed when he was fatally shot by white officer Darren Wilson on Aug. 9, 2014. Wilson was cleared of wrongdoing, but the shooting led to months of protests in the St. Louis suburb.

Wilson resigned in November 2014, soon after a St. Louis County grand jury decided not to indict him. The U.S. Department of Justice found no grounds to prosecute Wilson, but the shooting led to a Justice Department investigation that resulted in a consent agreement requiring Ferguson to make significant changes to address racial bias in its police department and municipal court.

Michael Brown Sr. and Lezley McMcSpadden sued the city, former Police Chief Tom Jackson and Wilson in 2015, citing a police culture hostile to black residents and claiming Wilson used excessive force.

Ferguson, Jackson and Wilson denied the allegations.

The parents also argued that the death of their son deprived them of financial support through his future potential wages.

U.S. District Judge E. Richard Webber approved the settlement but disclosed nothing about the amount, saying only that it was ""fair and reasonable compensation for this wrongful death claim and is in the best interests of each Plaintiff,"" with the money to be split between the parents.

Webber also wrote that the agreement ""shall remain sealed by this Court and shall be considered a closed record"" because disclosure of the information ""could jeopardize the safety of individuals involved in this matter, whether as witnesses, parties, or investigators.""

A Utah mother is sharing a heart-stopping video of her toddlers narrowly escaping tragedy after a dresser toppled onto them, hoping to raise awareness about the importance of safely securing furniture.

The video, captured on home surveillance footage last Thursday morning, shows Kayli Shoff's pajama-clad twin boys climbing onto a wide Ikea dresser in their room. As 2-year-old brothers Brock and Bowdy jump on the dresser and hang from its drawers, the furniture comes crashing down, pinning Brock's entire body underneath and catching Bowdy's feet.

""Obviously the weight of both of their bodies was too much for that dresser, so it came toppling over,"" Shoff, who lives in Orem, about 45 miles south of Salt Lake City, told NBC News on Tuesday.

Shoff said the boys had woken up early that morning. She estimated that up to seven minutes went by before she noticed the fallen dresser on the baby monitor. She ran to the boys' room, not knowing if they were injured.

In those terrifying moments before she got there, the video shows Bowdy had managed to wriggle himself out — and eventually edge the dresser just enough to free Brock, too.

""If you watch the video, I think he stops for about eight to 10 seconds and kind of analyzes the situation: My brother's crying, he's hurting, how can I help him?"" Shoff said.

The twin's mother said she hadn't heard the boys' cries, a thud, or anything out of the ordinary coming from their room.

""And that was the weird thing, because I always hear them cry or scream. We also had family staying with us and their room was right above Brock and Bowdy's room, and they didn't hear anything either,"" she added.

Shoff whisked both boys off to the pediatrician, where they were given a clean bill of health, she said.

A Consumer Product Safety Commission source told NBC News the agency plans to send an investigator to speak to her and her husband about the incident to gather more information.

Shoff knows the scenario could have played out very differently. Tipped furniture is a leading cause of death among kids, with one child dying every two weeks because of items such as dressers, TVs, or appliances landing on them and crushing their windpipe or striking them in the head, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

The agency recommends parents anchor furniture to the wall to prevent injury or death. Many dressers come with wall anchors. Inexpensive furniture straps can also be purchased separately at hardware stores or baby stores.

“ You need to tie your dresser down today, because honestly if you wait a day or two, you're just not going to get it done.”

The American Home Furnishings Alliance advises consumers to anchor all heavy furniture, not just the ones in children's rooms, and to verify that furniture meets industry standards for maintaining stability.

And advocacy groups such as Charlie's House offer childproofing safety checklists for parents to prevent tipping accidents or other tragedies around the home, including proper storage for cleaning products and how to block off fireplaces.

Shoff, who also has a 5-year-old son, says the dresser in their house has now been secured. Her husband, Ricky Shoff, who is a sales representative for the company that makes the home surveillance cameras that captured the incident, immediately bolted the dresser to the wall and took the knobs off of it so the boys can no longer climb up. He also put latches on the bottom drawers.

The dresser is made by Ikea, which just last month agreed to pay $50 million to the families of three children who were killed when their dressers tipped over and crushed them.

The dresser had come with wall anchors, but the Shoffs had never bothered to install them, thinking they didn't need them. The middle shelves of the dresser were already empty of clothing because the boys ""would just throw them out anyways,"" Shoff said.

Her clip of the dresser falling has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. While some commenters have given the Shoffs criticism for not preventing the accident, the majority have thanked them for sharing the video, Shoff said.

""I think we've made a big impact on people wanting to secure their dressers,"" she said. ""You need to tie your dresser down today because honestly, if you wait a day or two, you're just not going to get it done."""

Eisenstein'],"The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration just ordered Takata to order the recall of another 2.7 million potentially defective airbag inflators, a move that will cover vehicles sold by Ford, Mazda, and Nissan.

Earlier this week, Honda reported the death of a 12th American caused by faulty Takata airbags. Worldwide, at least 18 have been killed, with another 180 known to have been injured. About 70 million airbags have been covered by recalls in the U.S., a figure that grows to more than 100 million worldwide.

Takata declared bankruptcy last month, its assets sold to Detroit-based supplier Key Safety Systems. The move is expected to help speed up the production of replacement airbag inflators. A shortage of parts has meant extended wait times for many owners looking to get their vehicles repaired.

The latest recall covers 627,000 Nissan Versa passenger cars from the 2007 to 2012 model-years, with over 500,000 of them sold in the U.S.

Related: Honda Confirms 11th Death Related to Faulty Takata Airbags

Ford faces the biggest impact, with 2.2 million vehicles covered, though it has not yet released specific details. Mazda said only about 6,000 of its B-Series trucks will need to be repaired.

Less Than One-Third of America's 70M Faulty Airbags Have Been Fixed

The exact number of vehicles covered by the various Takata recalls to date has yet to be clarified, as some models use more than one of the faulty devices.

Initially, it was believed that a manufacturing problem at two North American factories caused Takata inflators to be vulnerable to use in warm, high humidity climates. That led to an early, geographically based recall. But as evidence mounted of problems in cooler, drier climes the recall was ramped up significantly and now extends to many other countries, as well.

Chinese regulators have been pressuring Takata and various automakers to speed up recalls, echoing the concerns of NHTSA and safety advocates in the U.S. According to federal data, barely one-third of the vehicles covered by previous Takata recall campaigns have been repaired so far.

A lack of spare parts has been one of the concerns, though the bankruptcy sale of Takata “will accelerate the removal of dangerous airbag inflators,” Peter Prieto, the court-appointed Chair Lead Counsel for many of the consumer plaintiffs taking legal action against the Japanese supplier, said last month.

Tough to Track Down Owners of Recalled Vehicles

Safety experts say the replacement parts shortage is just one of the problems, however. They also note that older vehicles covered by the recalls may have been sold multiple times, making it hard to trace current owners and advise them of the safety problem.

The latest expansion of the Takata recall has many safety advocates worried that the number of vehicles using faulty airbags could expand even further.

""Takata has told the public that their line of airbag inflators with moisture absorbent was safe. This recall now raises serious questions about the threat posed by all of Takata’s ammonium nitrate-based airbags,"" said U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat and frequent critic of Takata, in a statement. ""If even more are found to be defective, it will take us from the biggest recall ever to something that could become mind-boggling."""
79,http://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/what-those-inappropriate-dreams-really-mean-ncna785996,nbcnews,Have a racy dream about your boss last night? This is what it means,[],"Ever wake up in a sweat after having an, uhm, inappropriate dream about someone in your life you really shouldn't be thinking about in that way? While we can't exactly say that it happens to all of us, a study done by the University of Montreal did find that of the 3,500 participants surveyed, about 20 percent of women and 14 percent of men have had sexual dreams about a person who was ""off limits"" to them in the waking world.

If it's happened to you before, you know how awkward it can be to have to face the star of your dream in real life — and that uncomfortable moment is only magnified if that person happens to be your boss or your brother in law. But do we have any control over the things we dream about? What’s the catalyst behind these dreams about people in our lives who we know are not viable options? And what does it mean for us when we dream them?

A sex dream about your boss has more to do with how you view yourself. A sex dream about your boss has more to do with how you view yourself.

Here's a look at our dream process, why certain people appear in these subconscious scenarios while we sleep and a few tips for getting to the bottom of the real life reasons behind them.

How We Dream

Though there's still much to learn about the way we dream, Dr. A.J. Marsden, assistant professor of human services and psychology at Beacon College says there are a few theories that can help explain what goes on in our heads at night.

""Researchers know that 90 percent of dreaming occurs during REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep,"" she says. ""We have about 90-minute sleep cycles with REM sleep taking up more of that cycle the longer we sleep, which is why we usually remember the dreams we're having right when we wake up (during longer REM cycles)."" In terms of what's driving the trajectory of our dreams, Marsden says the areas of the brain that are most active are the ones that house our emotions. ""Specifically, the limbic system, responsible for dealing with both good and bad emotions,"" she says. ""The least active part of the brain during our dreams is our frontal lobes, which are responsible for higher order functioning and thought. This might explain why our dreams are often not very logical.""

When we can look beyond the content and explore the meaning underlying our dreams we can use them as a fascinating portal towards self-exploration. When we can look beyond the content and explore the meaning underlying our dreams we can use them as a fascinating portal towards self-exploration.

As for how our daily reality impacts our dream's subject matter, Dr. Harold Jonas, a psychotherapist practicing in Florida, says that though we try to operate within the scope of what we know as ""normal"" in our waking hours, once we hit the dream world anything goes. ""During the day we have restrictions on thoughts and impulses,"" Jonas explains. ""The majority of us try to 'do the right thing' and stay within the behavior patterns recognized as the societal norm. But at night— everything changes. The brain may focus on a particular thought it had during the day — no matter how fleeting — and it potentially becomes a focal point for a dream."" And according to Jones, these instances can really run the gamut. ""Did you pass a movie poster of your favorite actor? Did a co-worker's hand brush yours reaching for a report, did something act as a trigger? Couple that with real life events, such as feeling stressed out by your spouse, not being valued at work or any real world daytime trigger, and you’re apt to start having physical, psychological and even chemical reasons for having sexual dreams which you may feel are with inappropriate people.""

Aside from the dream world offering us a literal escape from the day-to-day restrictions we place on ourselves, Marsden says that sex dreams in particular actually occur more often when we're feeling confident.

""Interestingly, we are more likely to have positive sexual dreams when we are feeling good about ourselves or when we are in a general good mood,"" she explains. ""Dreaming, in general, reflects the person's waking states, concerns, worries, desires, etc. Our dreams reflect how we are feeling. Our brain also has a way of using our dreams to act out scenarios that are unlikely or unrealistic in our day-to-day lives. An individual who desires someone who is 'off limits' may experience sexual dreams about that person because it’s the brain’s way of experimenting with the idea without actually following through with it.""

What Those Racy Dreams Really Mean

In terms of the most frequently reported star of these dreams, the boss scenario tops the list.

""Many experts say dreams about having sex with your boss are the most common — and sometimes the most disturbing,"" Jonas says. ""After a racy dream you wake up in the morning and have to go to that staff meeting like nothing happened.""

Often people symbolize other people in a dream, and it is really more about the emotions that you are experiencing. Often people symbolize other people in a dream, and it is really more about the emotions that you are experiencing.

However, this doesn't necessarily mean you're pining after your superior — more likely, it's the power that he or she symbolizes that you crave. ""Before you go thinking that you may subconsciously be secretly sexually attracted to your boss, realize that a sex dream about your boss has more to do with how you view yourself. It’s a dream about your own emerging power, professional abilities and leadership skills. You may be feeling ready to take charge and move your job to the next level compared to where you are now professionally.""

What does it mean when the tables are turned, and you're the one in the position of authority, seducing your intern or friend's younger sibling? Marsden says the answer lies in the context of the dream. “Focus on what was happening in the dream,” she says. “Were you teaching them and guiding them throughout the sexual acts in the dream? Most likely, this is our desire to be dominant in bed with someone we would feel comfortable with, someone we know.""

Another common dream scenario that can be troubling is the one where we're getting it on with our friend's significant other. But clinical psychologist Dr. Alexis Conason points out that what might be lurking underneath the meaning of this one is actually not an attraction you've worked to bury, but rather, a symbol of something else that might be happening in the relationship between you and your friend.

""Often people symbolize other people in a dream, and it is really more about the emotions that you are experiencing in the dream,"" Conason explains. ""So a dream about having sex with your best friend's husband may have more to do with a general sense of guilt that you are experiencing about another situation, boundary violations or competition.""

What about if the object of your affection is that best friend, not his or her significant other? Marsden says that because we spend so much time with our close friends, it's not surprising that they might show up in our dreams this way — no matter how bizarre it can be to experience this. ""Most likely, because we spend a lot time with our friends, it is not uncommon to have sexual dreams about them,"" she says. ""It is our brain’s way of trying it out. If we’ve ever consciously considered what it would be like, we are more likely to actually have the dream. However, sometimes the dreams do come out of nowhere — but that doesn’t mean that your unconscious mind didn’t consider the possibility!""

Using Your Unconscious Mind to Your Advantage

So what can we do, if anything, to try and put a stop to the dreams that are making things awkward in our waking hours?

Dreams are our mind's way of working to resolve conflicts and issues that we aren't able to resolve in our waking hours. Dreams are our mind's way of working to resolve conflicts and issues that we aren't able to resolve in our waking hours.

Marsden says that taking a hard look at the person who's showing up in your dream and what they symbolize will help bring insight. ""Examine why you think you might be having these dreams in the first place,” she says. “What is drawing you to that person? If you are dreaming about someone else and currently in a romantic relationship, take a hard look at your current romantic relationship. What is missing? What is it about this other person that your current partner might be lacking?""

Conason agrees that digging deeper into the ""why"" behind the dream scenario you're dealing with can help. ""Dreams are our mind's way of working to resolve conflicts and issues that we aren't able to resolve in our waking hours,"" she explains. ""The best way to stop having unwanted recurring dreams is to accept the dreams, try to view them as important communications from yourself and work towards understanding what they are trying to tell you. Working to resolve conflicts during our waking hours lessens our need to work through them in our sleep. When we can look beyond the manifest content of our dreams (the superficial who, what and where of our dreams) and explore the meaning underlying our dreams we can use our dreams as a fascinating portal towards self-exploration."""

The 49-year-old, who also hosted this year's Oscars, broke down in tears several times as he opened up about the ordeal. Before revealing the details, he assured the audience ""it has a happy ending.""

His son, William ""Billy"" John Kimmel, appeared fine when he was born on April 21. But a nurse noticed the baby had heart murmur and appeared purple in color.

This was soon diagnosed as ""tetralogy of fallot and pulmonary atresia,"" a rare condition meaning the pulmonary valve was blocked and there was a hole in the heart wall.

After ""more doctors and nurses and equipment came in — it's a terrifying thing"" — his newborn underwent successful surgery, Kimmel said, adding: ""It was the longest three hours of my life.""

Things are fine for now: His baby will have to have a second operation in three months and another in his early teens. But Kimmel also used the experience to give his views on healthcare policy.

""You know, before 2014 [when Obamacare came into force], if you were born with congenital heart disease like my son was, there was a good chance you wouldn't be able to get health insurance because you had a pre-existing condition,"" he said.

""If your baby is going to die and it doesn't have to, it shouldn’t matter how much money you make,"" he added. ""I think that's something that whether you're a Republican or a Democrat or something else, we all agree on that, right?""

Former President Barack Obama wrote on Twitter Tuesday afternoon to support the comic.

""Well said, Jimmy. That's exactly why we fought so hard for the ACA, and why we need to protect it for kids like Billy. And congratulations!,"" Obama wrote.

Kimmel also criticized Trump's proposed cuts to the National Institutes of Health. ""Thank God our Congressmen made a deal [Monday] night to not go along with that,"" he said.

Instead Congress gave the NIH a $2 billion raise."

President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to crack down on immigrants, whom he said were taking jobs from U.S. citizens, and signed an executive order in April calling for a review of the H-1B program. The visa allows foreigners with certain skills to work temporarily in the United States.

U.S. companies often use the visas to hire graduate-level workers in several specialized fields, including information technology, medicine, engineering and mathematics. The visas are heavily used in the tech sector.

On April 3, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) suspended ""premium processing"" of the visas for up to six months. Under the expedited procedure, applicants can be eligible for visa approvals within 15 days, instead of a regular review period that can last several months.

The United States currently caps H-1B visas at 65,000 a year, with an additional 20,000 allowed for those who have earned advanced college degrees in the United States.

The overall suspension remains in place but USCIS said on Monday in a statement that premium processing would resume for some applications from educational and research-oriented organizations exempt from the cap.

The agency resumed premium processing for physicians working under a specific waiver program on June 26.

USCIS has said that suspending premium processing was necessary to reduce a backlog of long-pending visa petitions and thus reduce overall H-1B processing times.

84,http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/legal-battle-behind-trump-tower-meeting-n785776,nbcnews,The Legal Battle Behind the Trump Tower Meeting,['Ken Dilanian'],"WASHINGTON — As Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya tells it, she met with Donald Trump Jr. and other Trump aides in New York last summer to press her case against a widely accepted account of Russian malfeasance, one that underpins a set of sanctions against Russians.

It's a cause Veselnitskaya has been pursuing for years. So, too, has Rinat Akhmetshin, the colorful Russian-born American lobbyist she brought with her to Trump Tower.

Trump Jr., who agreed to the June 2016 meeting at the request of a Russian business associate with a promise of dirt on Hillary Clinton, has said he didn't find much to interest him in the presentation. And little wonder: The subject is a dense and tangled web, hinging on a complex case that led Congress to pass what is known as the Magnitsky Act. The law imposed sanctions on individual Russians accused of human rights violations. It has nothing to do with Clinton.

The Trump Tower meeting has become the latest flashpoint in the ongoing investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia's election interference. The topic of the meeting, many observers have said, is almost beside the point.

But the substance of what the pair of Russian advocates say they came to discuss has a fascinating backstory.

It's an epic international dispute — one that has pitted the grandson of a former American Communist who made a fortune as a capitalist in Russia against a Russian leader who pines for the glory days of his country's Communist past.

In a cinematic twist, one person on the side advocated by Vladimir Putin, Veselnitskaya and Akhmetshin is a former American newspaper reporter turned investigator named Glenn Simpson. He is the same Glenn Simpson whose firm, Fusion GPS, helped craft the controversial dossier alleging that the Trump campaign colluded with Russian intelligence.

That dossier, published by Buzzfeed, made other, more salacious allegations about Trump, and FBI Director James Comey briefed the Republican about it before he took office. The dossier is not favorable to Putin and the Russian government.

Simpson's role on both sides of the Putin divide is set to be explored in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Wednesday examining the Justice Department's requirements for foreign lobbying disclosures.

Due to testify at the hearing is Simpson's longtime opponent in the Magnitsky dispute, William Browder, an American-born hedge-fund investor who made millions investing in post-Soviet Russia and gave up his U.S. citizenship in 1997.

Related: Russian Lawyer Veselnitskaya Says She Didn't Give Trump Jr. Info On Hillary Clinton

Simpson's lawyer said he would defy a subpoena to appear Wednesday because he was on vacation, and that he would decline to answer questions anyway, citing his right against self-incrimination.

Browder, whose grandfather Earl led the American Communist Party, accuses Simpson of peddling falsehoods as an agent of the Russian government. The law firm Simpson worked with on the case accused Browder in court papers of perpetrating a web of lies. Both men dispute the allegations.

The Death of Sergei Magnitsky

The story begins with the November 2009 death of Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian tax accountant who was working for Browder, and who later died in prison.

Browder's account of Magnitsky's death triggered international outrage.

According to Browder, Magnitsky was a lawyer who had been investigating a theft of $230 million in tax rebates paid to Browder's companies in Russia. Browder says his companies had been taken over illegally and without his knowledge by corrupt Russian officials.

Browder says Magnitsky was arrested as a reprisal by those same corrupt officials, and then was tortured and beaten to death. Browder presented documents suggesting that some officials who benefited from the alleged fraud purchased property abroad.

That account led Congress to pass the so-called Magnitsky Act in 2012, imposing sanctions on the Russian officials who were alleged to have violated Magnitsky's human rights.

The Russian government soon imposed a ban on American adoptions of Russian children, ostensibly for other reasons but done in response, many experts say, to the Magnitsky sanctions.

Forty-four Russians are currently on the Magnitsky sanctions list maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department, meaning their U.S. assets are frozen and they are not allowed to travel to the U.S.

Once a Putin supporter, Browder became one of the Russian leader's most ardent foes, spearheading a campaign to draw international attention to the Magnitsky case. He and his employees at Hermitage Capital Management presented information to governments, international bodies and major news organizations.

Browder's advocacy marks a shift from 2004, when, as one of Russia's leading foreign investors, he praised Putin so vigorously that he was labeled Putin's ""chief cheerleader"" by an analyst in a Washington Post article. Browder has said that Magnitsky's death spurred him to reexamine his view of Putin.

The State Department, lawmakers of both parties and the Western news media have described the Magnitsky case in a way that tracks closely with Browder's account. Browder's assertions are consistent with the West's understanding of the Putin government — an authoritarian regime that has been widely and credibly accused of murdering journalists and political opponents.

In 2013, the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office sued a Russian company, accusing it of laundering some of the proceeds of the fraud Magnitsky allegedly uncovered. The complaint incorporated Browder's account about what happened to Magnitsky.

That lawsuit set in motion a process through which that version of events would come under challenge.

The defendant, a company called Prevezon, is owned by Denis Katsyv, who became wealthy while his father was vice governor and transport minister for the Moscow region, according to published reports. The father, Pyotr Katsyv, is now vice president of the state-run Russian Railways. Veselnitskaya has long represented the family.

Prevezon hired a law firm, BakerHostetler, and a team that included a longtime New York prosecutor, John Moscow. Also working on Prevezon's behalf were Simpson, Veselnitskaya and Akhmetshin.

Simpson, a former investigative reporter for the Wall Street Journal, declined to comment.

Simpson also worked with former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele in the creation of the dossier that asserts Trump collusion with Russian election interference. A source close to him said his work on the dossier was kept confidential from his other clients.

The federal civil lawsuit by the Manhattan U.S. attorney against Prevezon was the first opportunity for the U.S. government to publicly present whatever evidence it had to support its legal assertions regarding Magnitsky. It was also an opportunity for the defendants to conduct their own investigation.

Prevezon's American legal team alleged that Browder's story was full of holes — and that the U.S. and other governments had relied on Browder's version without checking it. Browder and the U.S. government disagreed.

The chief American investigator, Todd Hyman of the Department of Homeland Security, testified in a deposition that much of the evidence in the government's complaint came from Browder and his associates. He also said the government had been unable to independently investigate some of Browder's claims.

In court documents, Prevezon's lawyers alleged that Magnitsky was jailed not because he was a truth-seeker — but because he was helping Browder's companies in tax evasion.

The Prevezon attorneys charged that Browder ""lied,"" and ""manipulated"" evidence to cover up his own tax fraud.

The story was ""contrived and skillfully sold by William F. Browder to politicians here and abroad to thwart his arrest for a tax fraud conviction in Russia,"" says a 2015 federal court filing by one of Prevezon's lawyers, Mark Cymrot of BakerHostetler.

A Russian-born filmmaker named Andrei Nekrasov made a similar set of arguments in a docudrama released last year. Neither Prevezon nor the Russian government had a role in funding or making the film, both parties say, though Veselnitskaya and Akhmetshin helped promote it.

Nekrasov, who has a history of making films critical of Putin, says it was funded by Arte, a French and German television channel, and the Finnish and Norwegian film institutes, among other European entities.

Nekrasov says he set out to make a documentary celebrating Magnitsky and Browder, which he says explains why Browder granted him interviews. But he reversed course. His film accuses Browder of misstating the contents of Russian court documents.

""Magnitsky didn't expose any crimes,"" Nekrasov told NBC News. ""The police did not imprison Magnitsky to make him withdraw some accusations. And they did not murder him.""

'Calculated and Callous'

In a sworn deposition, and in written statements to NBC News, Browder vehemently disputed his critics.

He called their allegations ""a calculated and callous attempt to harm and discredit me,"" and ""an offensive lie motivated by the desire of accused Russian money launderers to avoid facing justice in the U.S.""

In July 2016, Browder filed a complaint with the U.S. Justice Department, alleging that Prevezon and Simpson were engaged in an illegal lobbying campaign in violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. It's unclear whether the complaint has prompted enforcement action.

Browder also campaigned against the Nekrasov film, even as Veselnitskaya was lobbying on its behalf. A showing that had been scheduled before the European Parliament was cancelled at the last minute after Browder's lawyers threatened legal action. Ultimately, the film was shown at the Newseum, a museum of the news media in downtown Washington. A handful of activists hooted and jeered.

BakerHostetler was disqualified from the case in October 2016 because attorney John Moscow had originally represented Browder's investment company for nine months, creating what an appeals court deemed a conflict of interest. Prevezon got new lawyers.

But the dispute never got to trial.

Prevezon settled the lawsuit in May — with no admission of wrongdoing — by agreeing to pay $6 million. The U.S. government originally sought to freeze $20 million of company assets. Both sides claimed victory.

Thus, the competing claims were never adjudicated — and they remain difficult to sort through. They hinge on interpretations of various Russian court and police records from many years ago, a span of time and language that can cloud the picture for Western observers.

The judge in the federal case did rule this year, however, that a well-publicized 2013 report on the Magnitsky case, by the Council of Europe, was ""unreliable"" because it didn't fairly examine both sides.

""One of the events that may have colored the investigation from the outset is William Browder's interference with the assembly's work,"" the judge, William H. Pauley III, said during a May 3, 2017 hearing.

One aspect of the case that has been examined independently is Browder's contention that Magnitsky was beaten with rubber batons just before his death by eight guards for more than an hour.

For example, Browder said on MSNBC on February 5, 2015: ""Eight riot guards with rubber batons beat him for an hour and 18 minutes until he died.""

The lawyers and the filmmaker argue there is little evidence to support that.

It's an important point, because Browder's contention is that Magnitsky was murdered to silence him. Those challenging Browder say Magnitsky died of medical neglect under circumstances sadly typical of a Russian jail.

In an email to NBC News, Browder cited as evidence Magnitsky's death certificate, which mentions a ""closed (head) injury,"" followed by a question mark. But an English translation of the certificate (posted on the web by Browder) lists the cause of death as ""toxic shock syndrome and acute cardiovascular collapse."" It adds, ""No signs of a violent death detected.""

Two Russian organizations examined Magnitsky's treatment in prison.

A December 2009 report by Russia's Public Oversight Commission for Human Rights — a Russian non-governmental organization that monitors human rights conditions in detention facilities — makes no mention of beatings, and says Magnitsky died after a lack of medical attention exacerbated by harsh jail conditions.

A second report in 2011, by the Presidential Council for Human Rights, titled ""Preliminary Conclusion of the working group on the study of circumstances of Sergey Magnitsky's death,"" says he was deprived of medical care, and that ""there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the death was triggered by beating.""

However, the head of the presidential council's working group, Kirill Kabanov, said in a 2015 court affidavit that he no longer stands by that and other conclusions in the report, which he said were preliminary. In a sworn affidavit given to Prevezon's lawyers and filed in U.S. district court, Kabanov said some of the report's conclusions were ""copied verbatim"" from documents submitted by Browder and his associates.

In a telephone interview last year with NBC News, Kabanov said, ""The results of official forensic expertise that used original biological materials showed no evidence of beatings.""

Click Here to Read the Affidavit

Asked to respond, Browder said Kabanov's current remarks ""are in direct contradiction to the 2011 Presidential Human Rights Council Report"" and other evidence, which Browder says prove that Magnitsky was severely beaten.

""The fact that Kabanov by 2015-2016 has completely changed his mind and gone as far as to recant his own written and public statements from 2011 destroys his credibility to make any comments on this case,"" Browder said in an email.

In 2010, Browder asked the U.S. group Physicians for Human Rights to examine all the available medical evidence in Magnitsky's death, including the photos that Browder says prove Magnitsky was beaten to death.

The resulting 2011 reportcites evidence of medical neglect and inhumane prison conditions, but it does not mention beating.

In an interview with NBC News, Dr. Robert Bux, the El Paso County, Colorado coroner who led the review, said the available information suggested Magnitsky died of a septic shock — an infection.

Bux said that while he could not rule out that Magnitsky had been beaten at some point, he did not see evidence that Magnitsky was beaten to death.

""We didn't have everything"" investigators would like to have to reach a conclusion, he said, but ""I didn't have anything that substantiates that claim. In the limited photos that I saw, I didn't see any evidence of that.""

In an email, Browder pointed to photos of Magnitsky's body, showing bruises on his hands and left knee. And he noted that Magnitsky's mother, Natalia Magnitskaya, has asked the Russian government to investigate what she believes was a murder.

""The evidence is overwhelming"" that Magnitsky was beaten to death, Browder said on July 14 on MSNBC. ""We have pictures of his beaten body, we have doctors' reports from their own Kremlin doctors."""

They’ve built a prototype that generates a few drops of perspiration — enough to measure blood sugar and to monitor other bodily functions.

Researchers at Stanford University say they've taken a big step to wearable health tech with a wristband device that can measure blood sugar and other important measures of health in a few drops of sweat. Sam Emaminejad / Stanford University

It’s not ready for the market yet, but shows it is possible for people to wear lightweight devices that can deliver on the promise of pain-free diagnosis.

“You don’t stick people with anything. You can just wrap it on people’s hands and have them engage in their daily activities and you can continuously monitor them,” said Sam Emaminejad, who helped work on the device while at Stanford University.

Many groups are working to develop wearable health tech, from the glucose-sensing contact lens that Google currently has put on hold, to a so-called artificial pancreas that is really a series of linked devices that monitor blood sugar and deliver insulin as needed for diabetes patients.

Related: New Wearable Tech Could Help Blind People See

What a wearable health device needs is enough bodily fluids to measure something, such as blood sugar, sodium or hormones. The time-honored method is a needle, and anywhere from a drop to a few vials of blood.

Non-invasive alternatives would have to use sweat.

There are several problems with that, number one being whether you can measure blood sugar or look for, say hormones, in sweat. Second is getting enough sweat to measure in the first place.

The Stanford team thinks they have done that.

Related: FDA Approves First 'Artificial Pancreas'

They’ve put together sweat-stimulating compounds into a small device that delivers a low current. It can measure glucose, sodium and other compounds in the sweat and wirelessly relay that information.

“This platform extracts sweat (at a high secretion rate) on demand or periodically and performs sweat analysis in situ (in place),” they wrote in their report, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

It was not painful and could be worn strapped to the arm. “It could be like a watch,” Emaminejad, who’s now at UCLA, told NBC News.

For proof of principle, the team measured blood sugar and minerals associated with flareups of cystic fibrosis in their volunteers. Such a device might be useful for monitoring a patient’s response to drugs, they said.

“One way I think this technology can be incorporated into our daily lives is to be incorporated into a smartwatch,” Emaminejad said. The compounds that stimulate sweating and that measure the desired compounds would need regular refreshing.

“We need a clever solution. Do we need a disposable cartridge that we can insert easily?” he asked.

And researchers will have to work on better ways to correlate measurements of blood sugar, lactase, potassium and other compounds taken from sweat to what doctors know they mean when measured in blood.

That’s one of the hiccups that held up work on the blood sugar-sensing contact lens — a lack of data on whether measurements in tears were as accurate as measurements taken from blood."

Here’s What the Evidence Shows,['Maggie Fox'],"There’s no strong evidence that anything prevents Alzheimer’s disease, but a few common-sense practices may help delay memory loss, a panel of experts said Thursday.

They include controlling high blood pressure, regular exercise and specific memory training exercises.

Outside of that, there’s no miracle cure and no surefire way to delay the loss of brain power that comes with aging, or the onset of dementia, the committee at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine concluded.

More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer’s, and this number is expected to grow as the population ages. There’s no cure, and treatments do not work well. Drugs such as Aricept, known also as donezepil, and Namenda can reduce symptoms for a time but they do not slow the worsening of the disease.

Related: Researchers Seek Test to Predict Alzheimer's

Researchers have some hints that drugs can reduce the brain-clogging plaques that are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s but they have not shown conclusively that the drugs can help symptoms or prevent disease. Such drugs are also years away from getting on the market.

“The strongest evidence was in the area of cognitive training.”

But there is evidence that some lifestyle changes might reduce the risk, or at least delay the onset of dementia.

The committee of experts looked at all the best research on ways to prevent memory loss and what’s called cognitive impairment — the loss of the ability to think clearly and make decisions.

Despite the explosion of online and commercial products — from supplements to memory games — that allege they can help, there’s very little out there that can be proven to slow or prevent the decline, the experts reluctantly concluded.

“At present, there are no pharmacologic or lifestyle interventions that will prevent mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease,” said Dr. Ronald Petersen, an Alzheimer’s expert at the Mayo Clinic, who was on the committee.

“All this is not new, but this review is the strongest evidence base we have,” Petersen added.

“We have all been exposed to a study here, a study there. One suggests this intervention is beneficial, the other finds it’s not. This review looked at the totality of literature over last six years and put it to the most rigorous test you can imagine.”

There are three rays of hope: cognitive training, blood pressure control and exercise.

“Even though clinical trials have not conclusively supported the three interventions discussed in our report, the evidence is strong enough to suggest the public should at least have access to these results to help inform their decisions about how they can invest their time and resources to maintain brain health with aging,” said Dr. Alan Leshner, chair of the committee and CEO emeritus of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

“The strongest evidence was in the area of cognitive training,” Petersen said.

This doesn’t mean crossword puzzles or Sudoku, although those won’t hurt, Petersen cautioned. The best evidence came from a study looking at specialized training.

Related: Alzheimer's Deaths up 55 Percent

“This was a study that looked at specific training of groups of people on, for example, memory improvement techniques, mnemonic techniques as they're called,” Petersen told NBC News.

“How can I improve my memory? Can I organize material that will help me remember material at a later point in time? Can I use certain strategies that will help me process information more quickly and more efficiently that may benefit me later on down the road?”

People will have to work at it, Petersen said. “Can you, in fact, find a new way to try to remember a list of grocery items?” Peterson asked. Instead of using a smartphone calculator to figure out a tip, do it in your head, he advised.

Commercial products have not proven they help, Petersen cautioned.

“We’re very concerned about the brain game industry taking this and running with it, and say NAS has shown that cognitive training is going to forestall cognitive decline, and we have our brain game here,” he said.

Most have done little more than show they make people better at playing those particular games, Petersen noted.

Related: Once-Promising Alzheimer's Drug Doesn't Work

Controlling blood pressure is something people should do anyway, to prevent heart disease. But good evidence shows it can reduce the risk of memory loss and dementia, probably because high blood pressure damages delicate blood vessels in the brain.

And several studies have shown that exercise can help.

“Here we're talking about modest aerobic exercise,” Petersen said. That includes brisk walking.

“How much? Maybe 150 minutes a week — 30 minutes five times, 50 minutes three times — can have an effect on reducing cognitive impairment later in life,” Petersen said.

“Try to avoid the tendency to sit down, watch television for endless hours at night. Get out there, do something.”

“Is it going to prevent Alzheimer's disease? I can't say that. But I think it may have an effect on reducing cognitive impairment.”

None of the evidence is strong enough to justify a public education campaign, the committee of experts concluded.

“We’re all urgently seeking ways to prevent dementia and cognitive decline with age,” said Dr. Richard Hodes, director of the National Institute on Aging.

“But we must consider the strength of evidence — or lack thereof — in making decisions about personal and public investments in prevention.”

Peterson said people can make everyday changes in their lives to keep their brains clearer.

“Try to avoid the tendency to sit down, watch television for endless hours at night. Get out there, do something,” he advised.

There’s no cure for Alzheimer’s and no long-term medical treatment that has been shown to reduce symptoms. But people who think they have symptoms should see a doctor as soon as possible, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. People need to plan their futures, and some conditions, such as vitamin deficiency, look like dementia but are easily corrected."

In many of the homes, he felt like he was an outcast and not treated as a member of the family, he said. A few times, he shoplifted from malls and grocery stores because his foster families didn’t provide him with a large enough allowance, he added.

It wasn’t until he was matched with Spencer Sun through Sun’s involvement with the nonprofit Chinatown Service Center that Wilson Sun felt he had found a parent that truly cared for him. Wilson Sun ended up living with his former foster parent through college and, after receiving a full scholarship to study accounting, changed his name to ""Sun"" when he got married.

“To be a parent or foster parent you have to have a lot of perseverance and patience because at the end of the day you’re going to see both the good and ugly of the foster kids too,” Sun, now 27, told NBC News. “[Spencer Sun] was the first parent that I felt was genuine that provided unconditional love and it was truly sincere. Spencer has done so much for me. He was the one who pushed me to want more in life.”

“Many of these Chinese kids are new immigrants, so it’s even more traumatic that they are placed in non-Chinese speaking homes, or non-Asian foster homes.”

Nonprofits in Los Angeles are looking for more Asian-American foster parents like Spencer Sun to serve the county's foster children with a particular focus on language ability and cultural understanding.

More than 18,000 children in LA County are in foster care, according to Neil Zanville, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services. Of those children, approximately 1.8 percent is Asian American and Pacific Islander, Zanville noted.

But despite that, the number of Asian-American foster families is limited, according to LA-based nonprofit Korean American Family Services (KFAM), which recruits and trains foster families among providing other services.

“In our mind, it might not be a large percentage, but 600 to 800 [Asian-American and Pacific Islander] foster kids is a good number of kids who could really benefit from having a family that understands their cultural needs,” KFAM executive director Connie Chung Joe told NBC News.

Three years ago, the organization struggled to find even one licensed foster care parent of Korean descent in Los Angeles and Orange Counties after meeting with community members who were concerned that kids were being put in households that struggled with language and cultural barriers.

“When we asked around, there were none in the Cambodian, Chinese, or other communities, either,” Chung Joe said.

Karen Lim, program director at Special Service for Groups’ Asian Pacific Counseling and Treatment Centers (APCTC), a nonprofit which partners with KFAM, noted that there are a significant number of Chinese kids who are removed from their homes due to alleged abuse and neglect , but very few Chinese-speaking families who can take them in.

“Many of these Chinese kids are new immigrants, so it’s even more traumatic that they are placed in non-Chinese speaking homes, or non-Asian foster homes,” Lim told NBC News.

“To be a parent or foster parent you have to have a lot of perseverance and patience because at the end of the day you’re going to see both the good and ugly of the foster kids too.”

The lack of licensed Asian-American foster care parents and common misconceptions about the process to become one prompted KFAM to begin recruiting efforts.

In January 2014, the organization launched the Korean Foster Family Initiative. In December 2015, KFAM expanded its recruiting efforts into the Chinese community, partnering with APCTC and Chinatown Service Center, and rebranded the program as the Asian American Foster Family Initiative.

In December 2016, KFAM became a licensed foster family agency, allowing the organization to train and directly approve and certify foster families, Chung Joe said.

Since 2014, KFAM has been able to recruit 39 foster parents of Korean descent, according to Chung Joe, and the organization’s first group of foster families of Chinese descent is approaching approval.

The initiative’s current focus is finding potential Filipino foster parents, as they comprise the largest population of Asian-American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) foster kids in LA County, Chung Joe said.

“We’ve also been in discussion with Cambodian and South Asian [community-based organizations] who are asking if they can partner with us to expand into their communities,” she added.

On July 30, the Asian American Foster Family Initiative is scheduled host an information session, “How to Become a Resource/Foster Parent,” which is expected to include testimonies from Spencer and Wilson Sun.

“There’s not that many Asian-Americans that will come out to speak, let alone have a story similar to mine’s where despite everything, you pulled through and have a happy ending which is not common in foster care families,” Wilson Sun said. “Despite losing parents, you will find someone that truly loves you.”

Spencer Sun told NBC News that his faith played a role in deciding to become a foster care parent and in the AAPI community, conversations about safety and security are heavily emphasized, which may serve as an impediment to fostering.

Sun received initial pushback from his own parents and family when taking on the role as a foster care parent, he noted.

“I think they thought it was too risky and didn’t know what’s going to happen when you bring a strange kid into your home and you don’t know their background,” Sun said.

Sun added that, while foster parents being the same racial or ethnic group as foster children may help the transition go a bit easier, the ultimate goal is to find foster children a loving home after being removed from a traumatic environment.

“I just think that the kids can discern whether the foster parents genuinely care for them or not and so that would trump ethnicity and race,” Sun said.

But his co-opting of global pop hit ""Despacito"" on live TV has drawn a sharp and public slap-down from its popular Puerto Rican singers, Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee.

The left-wing leader was seen clapping along to a version of the song with lyrics altered to encourage Venezuelans to vote for a Constituent Assembly — a proposed new body that will have powers to rewrite the national charter and supersede other institutions.

As the song begins to play, Maduro can be seen telling the audience “lets see if it goes viral.” Afterwards, he asks: ""What do you think, eh? Is this video approved?""

Yet the political remix was far from popular with the original artists.

“At no time I have been consulted or have I authorized the use or change of Despacito lyrics for political ends, less so in the context of the deplorable situation affecting a country that I love so much as #Venezuela,” Luis Fonsi wrote in a post to his 4.5 million followers on Instagram.

“My music is for all of those that want to listen to it and enjoy it, not to use it as propaganda that tries to manipulate the will of the people that are crying out for their freedom and a better future,” he added.

Daddy Yankee used his Instagram account, which has 16.5 million followers, to post an image of Maduro with a red cross drawn over the top of it. ""With this nefarious marketing plan, you only highlight your fascist ideal,"" he wrote in the text that accompanied the image.

Erika Ender, who co-wrote the song, also commented on the photo-sharing site, saying she did not agree with the way it had been used. “I love Venezuela, a land that has given me true brothers in my heart. Brothers who suffer because of the situation that exists,” she said.

Despacito, which translates from Spanish as “slowly” and contains raunchy lyrics including “I want to undress you with my kisses, slowly,” is the most popular song in the history of YouTube having been viewed more than 2.7 billion times.

A remix featuring Justin Bieber was released earlier this year and it was last week announced as the most streamed song of all time by Universal.

However, it’s sexually explicit theme has led to it being banned on public radio stations in Malaysia after politicians there described it as “obscene.”

The version played on Venezuelan TV contained less exciting lyrics, including: ""It is the call to the constituent that only wants to unite the country.""

Despite being oil-rich, Venezuela is suffering from a deep recession and hyperinflation. The country has also been beset by shortages of basic food and medical equipment.

Millions have taken to the streets to protest in recent months, heaping pressure on the Maduro's government.

Although she was quickly released on bond, she was re-arrested Tuesday and jailed on a probation violation stemming from an earlier theft conviction.

Payne, who is by turns charming and feisty, told NBC News before she was locked up that she simply forgot to pay for the items when she stopped by Walmart to pick up some medicine.

""Thieving was the farthest thing from my mind,"" she said in a phone interview.

The octogenarian, whose career as an international bling bandit spans six decades, said she had taken some medicine that muddled her mind before she went shopping.

""It causes me to forget,"" she said.

She claimed that since she didn't have a basket, she dropped the items in a shopping bag and thought she told the cashier about them.

The police report tells a different story. It says a security officer at Walmart watched Payne pile items from the pharmacy department in her purse and then transfer other items from her shopping cart to her purse and a shopping bag.

The guard nabbed her as she left the store and the items — which totaled $86.22 — were returned to the store. Payne was taken to the City of Chamblee Jail, booked on a shoplifting charge and released.

Despite her past exploits, chronicled in a Netflix documentary, Payne insisted she didn't mean to steal anything from Walmart.

Doris Payne's career as a thief spans decades. 11alive

""I have a money card with $7,000 on it,"" she said, adding that she is in the midst of negotiating a book deal and a movie deal.

Payne's attorney, Drew Findling, said it doesn't make sense that Payne would steal a bunch of necessities from the big-box store, which ""is a far cry from what historically people associate with Doris Payne.""

""There's no brooch, no diamond pendant, no earrings. She was at Walmart,"" he said. ""This doesn't fit into anything she has done before and we are going to look at the video and see what's going on, see if this is maybe forgetfulness.""

Payne was on probation for stealing a $2,000 necklace from a department store jewelry counter. The judge made her wear an ankle monitor and ordered her to stay out retail stores.

Findling said it's possible Payne could face prison time because of the Walmart episode.

""At her age, that would be tragic,"" he said. ""At my office, we're treating this like her life is on the line."""

Over the past few weeks, it's become famous as the home of the ""trio"" or the ""three gay husbands"" as locals now call Colombia’s first legally recognized polyamorous couple.

""Are you here to chat to the trio?"" a resident asks. ""We've seen a lot of foreigners over the past few weeks,"" a middle-aged woman adds. She says she's happy the three men are able to be themselves but doesn’t support polyamorous relationships, explaining, ""I believe marriage is something between a man and a woman.""

(L-R) Alejandro Rodriguez, Victor Hugo Prada and Manuel Bermudez are planning to hold a public wedding ceremony in Medellin, Colombia. Dimitri O'Donnell

Medellín was once famous as the home of drug lord Pablo Escobar, but these days it's better known for its vibrant arts and culture scene, lively nightlife and for having what is thought to be the world’s first legally recognized ""throuple"" — the term that describes a three-person relationship.

Manuel Bermudez, Alejandro Rodriguez and Victor Hugo Prada won a legal battle to formalize their ""special patrimonial union"" in June.

""Welcome to our little home!"" Prada, 23, says as he opens the door. On the second floor, an immaculately kept open-plan living area leads on to a terrace with impressive views overlooking Colombia’s second city. It's a calm and peaceful space with lots of homegrown herbs and plants. The walls are full of mainly gay-themed art. The most striking is a modern, sexed-up version of a muscle-bound St. Sebastian.

""We’re very artistic people,"" Prada, an aspiring actor, explains. He guides the reporter upstairs where a king-size bed dominates another open-plan space. ""All three of us sleep here, perfectly, with no problems,"" he says. ""It’s can be cold at night in Medellin so we sleep huddled together. It’s really nice!""

For Bermudez, Rodriguez and Prada, there’s nothing unusual about their domestic arrangement. ""We spend a lot of time together, but we also lead independent lives outside of the home,"" Prada explains. ""We don’t have specific roles or rules. Whoever gets up last makes the bed. Alejandro and I like to cook, and Manuel takes care of other things.""

Since their union was made public, Bermudez, Prada and Rodriguez have been at the center of an intense national debate about polyamorous relationships. ""It's been really crazy. The whole world seems interested in us, and it can be very intrusive,"" Rodriguez, a dancer and sports instructor, says.

Many people are curious about how they live and how a ""throuple"" works. ""I tell them we’re just normal professionals. We lead a quiet life in Medellín. This relationship is real and not for show. We’ve been together for a long time, and it works well,"" Rodriguez said.

The third member of this ""diverse family,"" as they call themselves, is journalist Manuel Bermudez. The youngest of 15 boys, Bermudez describes his early life as privileged. ""Nothing ever happened to me. I was never bullied at home for being gay. My family accepted me as I was,"" he said.

Bermudez and Rodriguez have been together for 18 years. They took on the state in 2000 fighting for legal recognition for their partnership and won. It would be another 16 years before Colombia legalized same-sex marriage. ""We wanted to show that gay couples can also be in a stable, permanent and loving relationship,"" Bermudez explained.

Eight years into their relationship, Bermudez and Rodriguez met Alex Zabala. All three lived together as a throuple until Alex died from stomach cancer in 2014.

Four years ago, Prada became the fourth member. He met them when he was just 18. ""Our main motivation is to honor the memory of Alex, and we believe he’s still with us in spirit,"" Rodriguez explained. ""He changed our lives for the better and has been with us all the way in this process for official recognition.""

Gay rights activist and lawyer German Rincon-Perfetti drew up the documents that define what the union represents. The trio were not granted a marriage, but the union has been given recognition and guaranteed legal protections. ""Colombia’s constitutional court wants to be seen as progressive, guaranteeing human rights and is keen to treat every citizen as equal,"" Rincon-Perfetti told NBC News.

He described the victory as ""historic"" and praised Colombia as the first country in the world to back such a union. The ruling is expected to have implications for those who do not fit the definition of what constitutes a traditional family unit.

""There’s single mothers, grandparents and aunts and uncles taking care of children that will benefit. Other polyamorous heterosexual couples will now be able to come out and live openly and honestly,"" Rincon-Perfetti said.

Bermudez, Prada and Rodriguez, however, don’t consider themselves trailblazers. ""We’re quiet people, and I know this sounds selfish, but we set out on this journey for ourselves and Alex and not to be part of some big campaign,"" Rodriguez says.

Shortly after they went public, they received messages of support from other polyamorous families around the world. ""They’ve congratulated us for bringing attention to the reality of what it means to be part of a loving polyamorous relationship,"" Bermudez says. ""The fear factor is preventing a lot of other throuples from coming out. They want everyone to know that love has no boundaries, and you can have a normal functioning relationship with three or four people.""

Since their landmark victory, the three men have been criticized by conservative groups. They’ve received death threats online but don’t take them seriously. ""It’s horrible to read some of the stuff on social media"" Bermudez says. ""But in real life the reaction has been fantastic. When we’re out in public old women and students tell us: ""Wow! How brilliant and brave we are, its something really special for us.""

Prado recently told his two partners he would like to be a father at some stage. Colombia’s same-sex couples can legally adopt under a progressive law passed in 2015. Bermudez and Rodriguez were surprised. ""I’ve never imagined myself as a dad. It was never part of my life plan,"" Rodriguez admits. ""But we’re part of this special polyamorous relationship, and we support each other. If the time comes when Victor decides he’s ready for a child, we’ll be beside him with our full support.""

There’s palpable excitement when talk turns to the ""wedding."" ""Its going to be in public in a place where anyone can come along,"" Rodriguez tells NBC News. The ceremony, he says, will be theatrical in tone with a lot of dance and spiritual elements. It will also pay tribute to the life of Alex Zabala and will end with a three-way kiss to seal the deal.

""We’re already getting wedding gifts,"" beams Prada, as he takes out a framed pencil sketch of himself, Rodriguez and Bermudez. They’re sitting in a pink car with big, broad smiles. The words ""Just Married"" splashed across the front and the number plate reads ""la trieja"" (the trio).

When jokingly asked if they feel like they're living a bride and groom fairy tale cliché, Prada says with a laugh, ""We're better than that."" He adds, ""We’re already living our 'happily ever after.""

97,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-takes-aim-support-historically-black-colleges,msnbc,Trump takes aim at support for historically black colleges,[],"In late February, Donald Trump signed an executive order intended to signal support for historically black colleges and universities. The Republican president, who hosted a widely seen photo-op in the Oval Office with HBCU officials, said at the time that these institutions of higher learning would be “an absolute priority for this White House.”Trump added at the time, “I am thrilled to be signing an executive order to recognize the importance of historically black colleges and universities – very important. They have played such an important role in achieving progress for African Americans in our nation’s march for justice.”As it turns out, the White House is saying something quite different now. Politico reported over the weekend:

A Washington Post report added, “People in higher education circles worried that the statement meant that the president was planning to get rid of a capital financing program that helps historically black colleges repair, renovate and build new facilities.”The Post’s report added that Trump intends to treat the financing program “in a manner consistent with the (constitutional) requirement to afford equal protection of the laws.”In fairness, no one knows exactly what that’s intended to mean.Indeed, there’s some ambiguities surrounding the administration’s position. Trump, who obviously doesn’t keep up on policy details or the substance of any area, pointed to the Historically Black College and University Capital Financing Program – a program that helps these school receive low-cost construction loans – as potentially problematic, but no one can say what that means in practical terms, or what the White House intends to do next.Derek W. Black, a law professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law who studies constitutional and education law, told Politico the signing statement is “ rather odd .” The professor added, “If Congress is validly spending money on these programs, and there’s no court finding or litigation suggesting discrimination, the idea that the executive would unilaterally not allocate those funds would be a rather momentous position to take.”It’d also be the exact opposite of what Trump told officials from these schools as recently as late February.As a candidate, the Republican billionaire routinely told largely white audiences, “Look at how much African-American communities are suffering from Democratic control. To those I say the following: what do you have to lose by trying something new like Trump? What do you have to lose?”As it turns out, they have quite a bit to lose."
98,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/devos-picking-schools-should-be-picking-uber-lyft-or-taxis,msnbc,"DeVos: Picking schools should be like picking Uber, Lyft, or taxis",[],"“How many of you got here today in an Uber, or Lyft, or another ridesharing service? Did you choose that because it was more convenient than hoping a taxi would drive by? … Just as the traditional taxi system revolted against ridesharing, so too does the education establishment feel threatened by the rise of school choice. In both cases, the entrenched status quo has resisted models that empower individuals. “Nobody mandates that you take an Uber over a taxi, nor should they. But if you think ridesharing is the best option for you, the government shouldn’t get in your way. “The truth is that in practice, people like having more options. They like being able to choose between Uber Pool, Uber X, Lyft Line, Lyft Plus, and many others. Or when it comes to taking a family trip, many like options such as Airbnb. “We celebrate the benefits of choices in transportation and lodging. But doesn’t that pale in comparison to the importance of educating the future of our country? Why do we not allow parents to exercise that same right to choice [sic] in the education of their child?”

Taken at face value, I imagine many at the Brookings Institution event probably found this quite compelling. If you don’t stop to think about it, giving people a “choice” sounds like an inherent good that should be applied broadly, even to education.So let’s take a minute to explain why DeVos’ rhetoric is fundamentally flawed.The idea that families don’t have educational choices is, by and large, plainly wrong. Nationwide, parents can send their child or children to a public school, for a free quality education. In much of the country, if parents prefer, they can also choose between private, parochial, or charter schools. If none of those are appealing, many families home-school their kids.But wait, DeVos would probably say, those varied options may exist in theory, but in practice, many Americans can’t afford private education. That’s true. It’s also where her ridesharing analogy starts to break down.For many low-income Americans who can’t afford a car, “choices in transportation” don’t really exist. Those folks can walk, bike, or take a bus. Taxis and ridesharing may sound nice, but for those who struggle economically, they’re not a realistic “choice.”DeVos, as best as I can tell, isn’t recommending taxpayer-funded vouchers to help those Americans subsidize their taxi and/or ridesharing choices, motivated by some kind of hostility towards municipal bus networks. She simply assumes that people with more resources will have greater transportation options than people with fewer resources – just as the wealthy have more choices in housing, health care, nutrition, technology, clothing, recreation, and many other aspects of modern American life.If the Education Secretary were calling for governments to invest taxpayer money into taxis and ridesharing, so that those who rely on buses and bikes can take better advantage of their “choices in transportation,” we’d be having a different kind of conversation. But DeVos, like many on the right, wants to give low-income Americans taxpayer money to choose privatized education – and just privatized education.OK, so maybe DeVos’ vision is overly myopic. But so what? Why not treat education and transportation as comparable service commodities?The answer is that the two have very little in common. If you want to turn to taxis and ridesharing to get to where you’re going, you pay a fare. It’s a business venture that relies on profit. If you want to turn to a school to educate you child or children, it’s a very different model, at least if you rely on the public-education system, which doesn’t even try to turn a profit because the kids don’t pay tuition.Even private schools operate in fundamentally different ways. Imagine, before you could take advantage of a ridesharing service, you had to pass an entrance exam. Or had to profess certain religious beliefs. Or faced discrimination based on your sexual orientation. That would be absurd, of course, with Uber or Lyft, but in private education, parochial schools have operated this way for decades.Making matters slightly worse, in DeVos’ model, even if your child or children can pass the exams and meet the private school’s related standards, the voucher DeVos would hand you may not cover the full cost of tuition – which means you’d be headed back to the public school system that would suddenly have many of its best students taken away as a result of the privatization/choice scheme.Other than all of these flaws and all of the actual evidence, though, the Education Secretary’s analogy makes perfect sense."

105,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/why-its-unwise-trump-target-alaskas-lisa-murkowski,msnbc,Why it’s unwise for Trump to target Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski,[],"At a White House event yesterday afternoon, Donald Trump acknowledged that his party had cleared a procedural hurdle as part of its health care crusade. The president’s Republican Party, however, was not unified in the endeavor.

“So we had two Republicans that went against us, which is very sad, I think,” Trump said. “It’s very, very sad – for them.”

This morning, the president kept it going, this time singling out Sen. Lisa Murkowksi (R) of Alaska with an angry tweet:

“Senator @lisamurkowski of the Great State of Alaska really let the Republicans, and our country, down yesterday. Too bad!”

First, the idea that Murkwoski let down the entire country by standing up for health care benefits is plainly bonkers.

Second, it’s not at all clear why Trump is singling out the Alaska Republican for a very public rebuke. Murkowski wasn’t the only GOP senator to vote against the procedural measure yesterday afternoon, and she was one of nine GOP senators to break ranks on a “repeal and replace” measure last night.

But even putting that aside, Trump’s tweet was strategically unwise if he’s serious about reaching his own goals.

In a narrowly divided Senate, Republican leaders have no real margin for error if they’re going to pass a regressive health care bill. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) already appears to oppose her party’s entire initiative and wants to start anew with a less ridiculous approach. Other GOP skeptics abound.

It’s against this backdrop that Donald Trump effectively said, “I know what to do! While the process is still ongoing, I’ll accuse Lisa Murkowski of a partisan and national betrayal!”

This will almost certainly push the Alaskan even further away, which is the opposite of what GOP leaders wanted to see. Trump could be reaching out to Murkowski right now, trying to negotiate with her, or perhaps even selling her on the merits of his ideas. But he doesn’t know how to do any of that, so he’s trying Twitter abuse instead.

Postscript: Sen. John McCain told Murkowski yesterday she did “the right thing.”"

On Monday, for example, the Republican opponent of public education argued that “defenders of current system” of education are “ flat-earthers .” I don’t think she was kidding.Yesterday, DeVos was on Capitol Hill, testifying at a House Appropriations subcommittee, where the education secretary was eager to defend Donald Trump’s budget request for directing taxpayer money to private and parochial schools. Most of the hearing went about as one might expect, but an exchange between DeVos and Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) was of particular interest, because it focused on the voucher movement’s Achilles’ heel: taxpayer-subsidized discrimination.Slate had a good piece on what transpired:

Clark used Bloomington, Indiana’s Lighthouse Christian Academy as an example. The school currently gets more than $665,000 in state funding through a school voucher program, Clark said. It also openly reserves the right to deny admittance to any student in a family where there is “homosexual or bisexual activity” or family members who practice “alternate gender identity.” If Indiana applies for federal funding for schools like these, Clark asked DeVos, would her Department of Education require them to stop discriminating against LGBTQ students and families?



DeVos didn’t say yes or no. She just smiled and stuck to the generations-old cover for violent oppression in America. “The states set up the rules,” she said. “I believe states continue to have flexibility in putting together programs.”"

It was Cantor who helped bring ACA repeal bills to the House floor dozens of times. It was Cantor who helped spearhead “defund Obamacare” campaigns. And it was Cantor, we now know, who didn’t genuinely believe his own nonsense.

The former GOP leader in the House talked to the Washingtonian’s Elaina Plott and conceded that his Republican Party is in a tough spot – parts of the conservative base expect the party to repeal the ACA, because that’s what they were promised – in part because of promises he and his colleagues made that they never intended to keep.

Asked if he feels partly responsible for their current predicament, Cantor is unequivocal. “Oh,” he says, “100 percent.” He goes further: “To give the impression that if Republicans were in control of the House and Senate, that we could do that when Obama was still in office….” His voice trails off and he shakes his head. “I never believed it.” He says he wasn’t the only one aware of the charade: “We sort of all got what was going on, that there was this disconnect in terms of communication, because no one wanted to take the time out in the general public to even think about ‘Wait a minute – that can’t happen.’ ” But, he adds, “if you’ve got that anger working for you, you’re gonna let it be.”

In context, when Cantor says he and his party felt the need to “let it be,” he means that Republicans fed a bunch of nonsense to their own voters, then exploited their anger for electoral gain with no intention of following through.

Cantor and his colleagues, in other words, played their base for fools – because they thought it’d help them win some elections, which it did.

I didn’t really expect the former House Majority Leader to admit that he helped oversee a cynical multi-year charade, but it’s good to see Cantor coming clean now."

As of yesterday, however, AVR is now the law in nine states.

Gov. Gina Raimondo has signed a bill that allows qualified voters to automatically register. The new law would provide automatic voter registration for eligible citizens when they’re obtaining or renewing a driver’s license, unless the person chooses to opt out…. The bill passed last month in the House and Senate and had bipartisan support. Rhode Island becomes the ninth state to put in place automatic voter registration.

Illinois appears likely to become the 10th state to adopt the policy, with the legislature already having approved AVR and Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) is expected to sign it. What’s more, the issue will be on the statewide ballot in Nevada next year, and the consensus is it’s likely to pass.

Circling back to our previous coverage, this is a policy that’s tough to argue against. When it comes to registering to vote in the United States, the burden has traditionally been on the individual: if you’re eligible to vote, it’s up to you to take the proactive steps needed to register.

Automatic voter registration, which already exists in many of the world’s democracies, flips that model. The idea is exactly what it sounds like: states would automatically register eligible voters, shifting the burden away from the individual. Those who want to withdraw from the system can do so voluntarily without penalty, but otherwise, Americans would be added to the voters rolls automatically.

At the federal level, Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) has taken the lead on sponsoring a national AVR bill, and his proposal has 108 co-sponsors. At this point, however, literally all 108 are Democrats. In a House led by a far-right Republican majority, the bill has no realistic chance of getting a vote, at least in this Congress.

That said, the scale of the Democratic supports suggests the next time control of Capitol Hill changes hands, we may see some real movement on this."

So, in about three hours, GOP lawmakers are likely to pass an unpopular health bill that cuts taxes on the wealthy while undermining schools for special-needs children.At a certain point, congressional Republicans stop looking like American policymakers and start looking like villains from a Dickens novel.The New York Times spoke to Vickie Glenn, a Medicaid coordinator for a special-education program in Illinois, who said , “If I could have 10 minutes with President Trump, I could help him understand what we do, why it’s important. If he understood, he would protect it, because this isn’t Republicans and Democrats. It’s just kids.”Who knows, that might make a difference. The last person to speak to Donald Trump often convinces him, just so long as no one else gets his ear.But Vickie Glenn won’t get that chance, at least not before House Republicans pass their depraved legislation this afternoon.You might be wondering why we’re just hearing about something like this now. Indeed, the Times’ report coincides with a Wall Street Journal piece , which we discussed earlier, about the realization that the GOP bill may also undermine private-employer-based insurance in ways that haven’t been talked about, either.The explanation for this has everything to do with how House Republicans are choosing to legislate. Ordinarily, concerns such as these would be raised over the course of months, as policymakers hold hearings, receive testimony from subject-matter experts, consult with industry stakeholders, and scrutinize the projected impact of their proposals. They even have the opportunity – get this – to improve bills before voting on them as they learn of unintended consequences.But not in this case. Republicans are rushing the bill onto the floor without hearings, without testimony, without debate, without scrutiny, and without so much as a CBO score.And so we’re seeing stories like these about hurting special-needs kids the day of the vote. We’re likely to learn even more tomorrow and in the coming days – after the bill passes the House."

140,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/its-not-enough-john-mccain-say-the-right-things,msnbc,It’s not enough for John McCain to say the right things,[],"It was a dramatic moment on Capitol Hill yesterday when Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), recently diagnosed with brain cancer, arrived on the Senate floor. Without the veteran lawmaker, Republicans would not have been able to advance their effort to take health care benefits from millions of Americans.

Soon after casting his vote with his party, McCain delivered prepared remarks on his concerns about contemporary politics and what’s become of the legislative process, and much of the media, which has long gushed over the Arizona senator, could hardly contain its praise. Here, for example, was CNN’s report:

In a Washington moment for the ages, Sen. John McCain claimed the role of an aging lion to try to save the Senate, composing a moving political aria for the chamber and the country that he loves. With a deep-red scar etched from his eyebrow to his temple, the legacy of brain surgery less than two weeks ago, McCain beseeched his colleagues to forsake political tribalism and restore the chamber to a spirit of compromise that had helped forge national greatness.

Roll Call published a related piece, telling readers, “Years from now, when the history of the modern Congress is written, John McCain’s address to the Senate on July 25, 2017, is likely to stand among the defining summations of the era.”

I realize that the political media has its favorites, and for a variety of reasons, McCain has long been a media darling. I’m also aware of the unique circumstances: a man who’s devoted much of his life to public service, including heroic military service, is facing a serious health crisis. Those who want to celebrate McCain’s work feel an added incentive to do so quickly and vigorously.

But the adulation paints an incomplete – and to a very real extent, misleading – picture for the public. One can respect McCain’s lifetime of sacrifices while still acknowledging the glaring gap between the senator’s words and his actions.

In isolation, McCain’s speech was, to be sure, a powerful rebuke to institutional breakdowns in the Senate. He made a compelling case for a more constructive and more deliberative legislative process, and he did so while holding both parties to account, which all but guarantees reverence from much of the Beltway press.

The remarks did not, however, arrive in a vacuum. McCain had just cast a partisan vote in support of an indefensible health care process, which intends to end with a bill that does not currently exist. The senator sang the praises of “regular order” in the Senate after casting a vote that ensured there would be no regular order on this issue.

McCain simultaneously condemned and protected a process he apparently opposes and supports. He expressed severe disappointment in his colleagues trying to pass major legislation without hearings or deliberations, and then rewarded those who’ve disappointed him, ensuring their victory.

The senator proceeded to announce his opposition to his party’s latest proposal, which he then voted to support just six hours later.

If McCain’s speech “stands among the defining summations of the era” in future history books, let’s hope the chapter also acknowledges the profound contradiction between his words and deeds – which, in a crushing sense, really did make this “a Washington moment for the ages.”"

146,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-raises-corruption-allegations-against-fbis-mccabe,msnbc,Trump raises corruption allegations against FBI’s McCabe,[],"Donald Trump first expressed his dissatisfaction with acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe last week in an interview with the New York Times. Yesterday, the president went considerably further, publishing a tweet suggesting McCabe is corrupt.

“Problem is that the acting head of the FBI & the person in charge of the Hillary investigation, Andrew McCabe, got $700,000 from H for wife!”

This morning, in a pair of tweets, Trump kept going.

“Why didn’t A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation but got big dollars ($700,000) for his wife’s political run from Hillary Clinton and her representatives. Drain the Swamp!”

I can appreciate how easy it is to grow inured to the bizarre circumstances we find ourselves in, but when a sitting president accuses the acting director of the FBI of corruption, without credible proof, that’s pretty extraordinary.

It’s also baseless. Two years ago, McCabe’s wife ran for office in Virginia, and like several other competitive candidates, she received campaign support from Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D). Jill McCabe’s candidacy nevertheless came up short.

Months later, Andrew McCabe helped oversee the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server protocols, which found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing.

In Trump’s mind, Terry McAuliffe and Hillary Clinton are the same person, and there was some mysterious conspiracy that doesn’t make any sense. (McAuliffe wasn’t in a position to know in 2015 what case McCabe might work on in 2016).

But in the larger context, the president whining about the acting FBI director isn’t about McCabe; it’s about Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whom Trump apparently believes he can force out of office through rude tweets. Indeed, this morning’s missives were ostensibly about McCabe – a popular target in conservative media of late – but note that the president started by asking rhetorically why Sessions didn’t replace McCabe.

I assume tweets like these will continue indefinitely until Sessions quits?"

153,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/perry-sees-climate-denial-evidence-being-intellectually-engaged,msnbc,Perry sees climate denial as evidence of being ‘intellectually engaged’,[],"In the Obama administration, the first Energy Secretary was Steven Chu, a Nobel laureate and a physics professor at Berkeley. He was succeeded by Ernest Moniz, who led the physics department at MIT.

In the Trump administration, things are a little … different.

Energy Secretary Rick Perry told CNBC on Monday he does not believe carbon dioxide emissions from human activity are the main driver of climate change, joining the EPA administrator in casting doubt on the conclusion of some of the government’s top scientists. Asked whether CO2 emissions are primarily responsible for climate change, Perry told CNBC’s “Squawk Box”: “No, most likely the primary control knob is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in.”

Close video California set to leave Trump behind on climate policy Governor Jerry Brown talks about California’s aggressive climate action policy, the deals his state is considering with Canada, Mexico, and China, and why Donald Trump is wrong on the Paris climate accord. share tweet email save Embed

In an apparent attempt to drive the reality-based community batty, Perry added that his skepticism towards climate data is a sign of a “wise, intellectually engaged person.”

It’s not just the cabinet secretary’s rejection of climate science that rankles; it’s also Perry’s explanation. He not only fails to accept the effects of carbon pollution, Perry believes climate change is the result of oceans “and this environment.”

What does that mean? I have no idea, but just as importantly, there’s no reason to believe Perry has any idea, either.

This reminded me of a New York Times piece from a couple of weeks ago, which I’ve been meaning to mention:

The campaign ad appeared during the presidential contest of 2008. Rapid-fire images of belching smokestacks and melting ice sheets were followed by a soothing narrator who praised a candidate who had stood up to President George W. Bush and “sounded the alarm on global warming.” It was not made for a Democrat, but for Senator John McCain, who had just secured the Republican nomination. It is difficult to reconcile the Republican Party of 2008 with the party of 2017, whose leader, President Trump, has called global warming a hoax, reversed environmental policies that Mr. McCain advocated on his run for the White House, and this past week announced that he would take the nation out of the Paris climate accord, which was to bind the globe in an effort to halt the planet’s warming.

In the Obama era, denying climate science became part of what it means to be a Republican. The more evidence emerged, pointing to a global crisis, the more GOP officials, candidates, and pundits announced their preference for dangerous, willful ignorance.

Several years ago, Mother Jones’ Kevin Drum wrote a memorable item about the trajectory of climate denial:

1. The world isn’t warming. 2. OK, it’s warming, but it’s not man-made. It’s just natural climate variability. 3. Fine, people are responsible. But it’s not economically worth it to do anything about it.

As Perry’s on-air comments to CNBC reminded us, contemporary Republicans have regressed, finding themselves split between numbers 1 and 2.

History’s judgment will be brutal."

155,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-intellectual-debate-rick-perry-says-he-wants-already-over,msnbc,The ‘intellectual’ debate Rick Perry says he wants is already over,[],"Last week, Energy Secretary Rick Perry told CNBC he considers his skepticism towards climate data to be a sign of a “wise, intellectually engaged person.” Yesterday, at a press briefing at the White House – it’s apparently supposed to be “Energy Week” – Perry used similar phrasing, calling for “an intellectual conversation” on global warming.

“Can we agree we ought to have a conversation as a people?” the Republican cabinet secretary asked. “Intellectually engaged, not screaming at each other, and not standing up in the middle of my speeches and saying you’re a climate denier, when the fact is, I just want to have a conversation about this.”

At face value, this may sound perfectly defensible. All Perry says he wants is a free exchange of ideas, with people of good faith sharing evidence as part of an open, deliberative process. Who’s prepared to take a stand against reasoned discourse and polite discussions? If Perry wants a conversation, why not engage in one?

The answer, as The New Republic’s Emily Atkin explained very well, is that Perry’s posture is a sham.

Make no mistake: When Perry says he just wants an “intellectual conversation” about how much carbon dioxide impacts the climate, that is a lie. Or, in the most generous interpretation, it’s a misunderstanding of what an “intellectual conversation” really is. Any intellectual person accepts that the scientific method is among society’s most reliable tools for determining facts. And climatologists have overwhelmingly determined, by use of the scientific method, that carbon dioxide emissions are the primary cause of current climate change. Perry is unwilling to accept the scientific method. Therefore, an intellectual conversation is not what he wants. What Perry does seem to want is further delay any actual intellectual conversation about climate change: a conversation that focuses on how best to solve it.

Quite right. Wise, intellectually engaged people have already wrapped up the conversation Rick Perry says he’s eager to have. They’ve now moved on to different conversations about solutions, stop-gaps, consequences, and points of no return.

If Rick Perry wants to get up to speed and participate in those discussions, I’m sure he could find some scientists who’d donate their time and help him understand the issues about which he’s still confused.

But let’s not mistake cynicism with curiosity. Perry keeps using that word, “intellectual,” but I don’t think it means that he thinks it means."

157,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-campaigns-pittsburgh-not-paris-rally-draws-dozens,msnbc,"Trump campaign’s ‘Pittsburgh, not Paris’ rally draws ‘dozens’",[],"In his White House speech on Thursday afternoon, Donald Trump delivered a soundbite that conservatives quickly embraced: “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.” The phrase, which drew quick applause from the president’s supporters, did not, however, make any sense: the international climate accord was agreed to in Paris, but it was intended to benefit everyone, not just Parisians.

Nevertheless, this Politico report, published the day after Trump’s speech, didn’t come as too big a surprise to anyone.

President Donald Trump’s campaign announced a “Pittsburgh, not Paris” rally across from the White House on Saturday to celebrate the United States’ withdrawal from a global climate agreement. The Fairfax County Republican Committee and the Republican Party of Virginia are sponsoring the rally in Lafayette Square, which is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. Saturday, according to an announcement from the Trump campaign.

It was hard not to appreciate the irony of Republicans holding a “Pittsburgh, not Paris” rally in Lafayette Square – literally across the street from the north side of the White House – which is named after a French general, Marquis de Lafayette, who helped America win the Revolutionary War. New York magazine’s Jon Chait noted, “There is literally no stupider location in the entire world to stage an anti-French American rally.”

And while that may be true, that doesn’t necessarily mean turnout for such a gathering would be poor. After all, if a sitting president’s campaign team announces support for a rally in a major American city, and the event is officially sponsored by a nearby state Republican Party, it stands to reason that plenty of GOP diehards would come out to express their support for Trump’s anti-climate decision.

So, how many people showed up?

BuzzFeed, which published some pictures from the rally, wrote that “dozens of Trump supporters” gathered for the event. The Washington Post similarly reported that “dozens” showed up to applaud the president’s decision to withdraw from the international agreement.

Hmm. The population of Washington, D.C, is nearly 700,000, but the greater D.C. area has over 6 million residents. Fairfax County, Va., near the nation’s capital, itself has over 1 million people. Trump World and its Republican allies managed to get “dozens” of people to express support for the president’s big decision?

That’s pretty sad – though I’ll look forward to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer telling reporters today that this was the largest turnout for any event in the history of Lafayette Square … ever.

Postscript: The Washington Post’s report added, “More than a thousand people gathered near the Washington Monument Saturday to rally at the March for Truth, calling for an independent investigation into alleged collusion between Russia and President Trump’s 2016 campaign.”

So on the one hand, we saw an event endorsed by the sitting president’s campaign operation, which drew “dozens” of people, while on the other hand, we saw a separate event – in the same city, on the same day, at nearly the same time – that wasn’t sponsored by any campaign, which drew “more than a thousand” attendees.

I’m starting to get the impression that one side of the political divide has a definite advantage when it comes to grassroots activism and enthusiasm.

Postscript: Reader B.G. reminds me of an “Arrested Development” episode that seems especially relevant to this story."

172,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/strike-two-senate-republicans-fail-again-aca-repeal-vote,msnbc,Strike Two: Senate Republicans fail again on ACA repeal vote,[],"Senate Republicans voted last night on Mitch McConnell’s latest health care proposal, which needed 60 votes to advance, but managed to receive just 43. This afternoon brought us Strike Two.

The Senate rejected a proposal Wednesday that would have repealed major parts of the Affordable Care Act and provided a two-year delay for lawmakers to develop a substitute, indicating that in the immediate future Republicans can only muster a majority for modest changes to the current law. In two separate votes over the course of less than 24 hours, lawmakers have rejected different approaches to rewriting the landmark 2010 law known as Obamacare.

Today’s measure, the “Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act,” commonly known as “repeal and delay,” needed 50 votes, but ended up with 45. In all, seven Senate Republicans – Collins, Heller, Murkowski, Alexander, Capito, McCain, and Portman – broke ranks and opposed the legislation, which garnered 55 “no” votes.

And as a matter of public policy and public health, that’s an encouraging development. This bill, which passed the Senate in 2015 when Republicans knew their vote was largely for show, would have repealed the Affordable Care Act in the short term, and then set a two-year deadline for Congress to figure something out. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office recently found that this bill would push 32 million Americans into the ranks of the uninsured over the next decade, include 17 million Americans just within the next year.

In fact, before we move on, let’s pause to note how amazing these circumstances are. We’re talking about a bill that would take coverage from 32 million people, repealing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with nothing, and 45 Republican senators voluntarily said, “Yep, that sounds good to me.”

They knew it wouldn’t pass, but these GOP senators wanted to be on record voting in support of this dangerous, regressive, and unpopular legislation anyway. Indeed, in a bit of a surprise, today’s bill received two more Republican votes than yesterday’s bill – which was itself depraved.

Nevertheless, we’ve now discovered that there aren’t 50 votes to “repeal and delay” or for “repeal and replace.”

The Senate is now moving toward the “vote-a-rama” phase in the process, in which senators consider a lengthy series of amendments. That’s expected to begin in earnest tomorrow.

In the meantime, GOP leaders continue to work on a final Republican bill – the sort of thing senators traditionally do before the process begins, not during the process itself – that McConnell & Co. hope can get 50 votes.

If all goes according to plan, and I use the word “plan” loosely, that vote should happen by the end of the week."

177,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-bans-transgender-americans-military-service,msnbc,Trump bans transgender Americans from military service,[],"The Obama era was a period of great social progress in the United States military. The Democratic administration ended the ban on gay and lesbian soldiers serving openly; the Pentagon made women eligible for combat roles; the Secretary of the Army was an openly gay man; and the administration ended the ban on transgender Americans serving in uniform.

On that last point, then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced in June 2016 that transgender service members are “talented and trained Americans who are serving their country with honor and distinction.”

Donald Trump apparently doesn’t care.

President Donald Trump announced a ban on transgender military service in a series of tweets Wednesday morning. “After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow…… Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming….. victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you,” Trump wrote in a trio of tweets Wednesday morning.

There was an odd point in last year’s presidential campaign, shortly after the Orlando nightclub massacre, in which Trump insisted that LGBT voters, en masse, should move to the right and vote Republican. Trump, in apparent seriousness, said he, not Hillary Clinton, would be the “better friend” of the “LBGT” [sic] community. Just two days after the Orlando shooting, Trump added, “Thank you to the LGBT community! I will fight for you.”

Anthony Scaramucci, a Trump advisor and surrogate who now serves as the White House’s communications director, declared earlier this year that Trump “is most pro-LGBTQ rights [president] in history. Why’s that story not written in mainstream media?”

That was before Trump decided to undermine the rights of transgender kids in public schools, which came before today’s tweets banning transgender Americans from serving in the U.S. military.

What’s not at all clear is what Trump and his Republican administration intend to do with the transgender Americans who are already serving in uniform. Remember, Barack Obama’s policy didn’t open the door to transgender troops; transgender troops were already there. Obama simply allowed these soldiers to come out and share their gender identity with their colleagues and commanding officers.

Trump, however, says he will not “accept or allow” transgender Americans “to serve in any capacity.” While we wait for further guidance from the military, it would appear this means a whole lot of dishonorable discharges are on the way, because our confused amateur president says so.

After Trump’s announcement, a Trump administration official told an Axios reporter, “This forces Democrats in Rust Belt states like Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin, to take complete ownership of this issue.”

It’s almost as if the White House is unconcerned with civil rights or military recommendations, and is solely interested in partisan political considerations."

The study, released Thursday by the Education Department’s research division, follows several other recent studies of state-funded vouchers in Louisiana, Indiana and Ohio that suggested negative effects on student achievement.

It leaves the Trump administration in an awkward position. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who was nominated and confirmed despite her opposition to public education and ignorance about education policy, is one of the nation’s leading advocates of privatizing schools through voucher schemes. It’s a crusade she continues to pursue with great vigor.The more the evidence mounts against the idea, the more Team Trump is left to argue that they want a policy that plainly doesn’t work.And before conservatives argue that this D.C. study is only one report, consider that there’s ample evidence pointing in the same direction. The New York Times reported in February, “[E]ven as school choice is poised to go national, a wave of new research has emerged suggesting that private school vouchers may harm students who receive them. The results are startling – the worst in the history of the field, researchers say…. It’s rare to see efforts to improve test scores having the opposite result.”For federal policymakers, the question is simple: does real-world evidence matter more than ideological goals or not?Postscript: Just as an aside, note that the Obama administration considered scrapping the D.C. voucher system, but then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) made a direct appeal to the Democratic president, saying it was personally important to him that the voucher program continue. Obama, trying to be conciliatory, agreed to leave it alone."

And last night, Republicans suffered an important defeat – the first of several.

With Vice President Mike Pence casting a tie-breaking vote, Republicans moved forward on health care reform Tuesday as the Senate successfully opening debate on the issue. But just six hours later, Republicans faced their first defeat in that process, failing to pass a measure that they’ve been working on that would have partially repealed and replaced Obamacare.

At issue was the latest iteration of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) bill – the Better Care Reconciliation Act (or BCRA) – which has been in the works for over a month. The measure needed 60 votes, but failed to even get 50: as the roll call shows, the final tally was 43 to 57, with nine Republicans voting with Senate Democrats against the measure.

It wasn’t, in other words, particularly close.

The Senate then broke for the night, with plans to vote this afternoon on an even-more-radical “repeal and delay” plan that would gut the Affordable Care Act and figure out what to do about it two years later. That will need 50 votes, and by all accounts, the measure will fall short.

And therein lies the point: for all of yesterday’s excitement, Republicans still don’t have a realistic plan to achieve their goals. GOP senators climbed to the top of the diving platform, jumped off, and hope to figure out what they’re doing before they reach the water.

For much of the country, this is understandably terrifying, because there’s so much uncertainty. No one can say with any confidence what Republicans will do, whether they’ll have the votes to do it, and just how many Americans will suffer if they succeed.

Nevertheless, we’re left with a dynamic in which GOP senators are no closer to solving the puzzle than they were a day ago, a week ago, or a month ago."
195,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-announcement-transgender-troops-surprises-pentagon,msnbc,Trump announcement on transgender troops surprises Pentagon,[],"Ordinarily, when pundits talk about the White House’s communications problems, they’re referring to Donald Trump and his team struggling to stick to an honest and consistent message. But this morning we were reminded of a different kind of White House communications problem.

The Pentagon seems to have been unaware that President Donald Trump has decided to bar transgender people from the military. A Pentagon spokesman, Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, refused to answer questions about what Trump’s tweeted announcement means for the current policy, including whether transgender people already serving in the military will be kicked out. “Call the White House,” he said.

It looks like the president just banned thousands of transgender troops without coordinating with the Defense Department. The White House also didn’t offer the Senate Armed Services Committee a heads-up, either.

And I don’t imagine anyone finds this is especially surprising. Trump picked a new FBI director without coordinating with the Justice Department. Trump makes foreign policy decisions without running them by the State Department. When Trump launched his Muslim ban, the Department of Homeland Security wasn’t at all clear on how to implement the president’s vision.

The president sees himself as a CEO, which is a flawed model for the head of a federal executive branch, but it’s especially problematic given that Trump looks at his administration as a small business instead of a large one.

As a candidate, Trump sold himself to voters as the head of a big and successful private-sector enterprise, but what went largely overlooked was the fact that the Trump Organization has always been a modest operation.

Mr. Trump often boasts of the size of the Trump Organization. “It’s a big company,” he said in the interview last spring. A spokeswoman said the business employed “tens of thousands.” But industry experts estimate that no more than 4,000 people work for the Trump Organization worldwide. And executives say that the three floors that make up the headquarters appear to have no more than 150 employees. It is a family business, as everyone involved is quick to explain.

It’s not as if Trump ran a major American company like General Electric, with hundreds of thousands of employees and multiple divisions, tackling a variety of complex operations. Rather, he oversaw a more modest company, with a small workforce, which left him plenty of time to become a television personality.

So when Trump makes important decisions about American troops, it doesn’t occur to him to coordinate with the relevant policymakers – in part because the president doesn’t know how government works and in part because he’s not accustomed to thinking in any other way."
196,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/refrigeration-not-essential-for-all-perishable-foods/,cbsnews,Foods you should never put in the refrigerator,[],"Refrigerators can help plenty of foods last longer, but many people don't know that not every perishable needs to be kept in the cold.

Chef Rachel Reuben of Food Fix Kitchen makes her living teaching others how to cook. Reuben says one of the most important lessons she provides involves guidance on which foods need to be refrigerated, especially when it comes to produce.

""I think we assume everything will do better in the refrigerator but that's not really true,"" Reuben told CBS News.

Knowing what food should and shouldn't be left to chill can ensure that what you eat maintains its quality, she explains.

While the cold can prevent many fruits and vegetables from going bad, that doesn't mean they'll taste as good or will be as healthy. ""They will lose nutrients and flavor in the refrigerator,"" Reuben said.

In the fridge, tomatoes lose their texture and potatoes can become gritty. Reuben believes other foods like apples, onions, avocados and citrus fruits are better when kept at room temperature. Bananas should never be refrigerated because they turn black faster, she says.

Berries can also be kept out of the fridge but should be eaten quickly, which is why Reuben recommends buying them in smaller quantities.

Many people refrigerate bread because there's a widespread belief that it will reduce mold growth. However, Reuben says that cold bread tends to dry out.

Reuben also pointed out one item most people don't refrigerate but probably should: nuts. Though it's safe to keep nuts in the pantry, Reuben says they will actually taste better and last longer if you store them in the fridge. They also contain oil, which can go bad over time.

""If you have a large quantity of nuts that you know you're not going to use for a long period of time, I would definitely keep nuts in the refrigerator,"" she said."

Chief Regalbuto offered something better -- to swear Ethan in as an honorary police officer in front of the entire department.

On July 17th, Ethan's dream came true.

""When he walked up and everyone met him there was a crazy buzz,"" Lynch said. ""It was an incredible vibe, because it's hard to get everyone together ... I don't think I've had a day I was more proud to be an American.""

""I can tell you that we both cried,"" Natalie Kranig told CBS News of the moment her son was sworn in. ""I knew this was the most amazing moment for my son. My heart melts.""

The video of Ethan's swearing in has since gone viral. For Natalie, who works as an EMT, and her family the outpouring of support comes at a moment when they need it most. Ethan has undergone 29 surgeries as a result of his disease, and the beach vacation was planned in coordination with a trip to Johns Hopkins for a follow up to his latest procedure. But her husband lost his job over a year ago, and the cost of Ethan's mounting medical bills and travel to Baltimore has caused the family home to go into foreclosure, Natalie said. They've set up an online fundraiser to help pay for Ethan's treatments.

""It's a terrible situation to choose between your mortgage payment or your son's vision,"" Natalie said. ""It's hard for me, but he's always been a happy kid. I know these are memories I can refer back to when things get tough.""

To make sure Ethan always has those memories and more, the Lunch with Lynch Foundation set up a drive to send first responder uniform patches to Ethan for his growing collection. He hopes to have a patch from every state one day."
198,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-americans-say-u-s-political-debate-is-increasingly-uncivil/,cbsnews,Poll: Americans say U.S. political debate is increasingly uncivil,[],"By Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus, Kabir Khanna and Anthony Salvanto

Members of Congress are getting positive ratings for the way they responded to the shooting in Alexandria, Virginia, last week. President Trump gets slightly lower -- though still net positive -- evaluations for his response to the attack, partly because Democrats are less likely to approve of his handling than of Congress'. Fifty-three percent of Americans approved of Congress' response, and 29 percent disapproved, while 46 percent approved of President Trump's response, and 36 percent disapproved.

CBS News

And while Congress and many observers called for a more civil tone to political debate in the wake of the events, Americans of all political leanings overwhelmingly say that the tone and level of civility in our political debates has been getting worse in recent years.

CBS News

These views are largely the same across ideologies, too, as about two-thirds of liberals, conservatives and even more moderates feel things have gotten worse.

Three-quarters of Americans feel the current tone of politics and debate is encouraging violence among some people; Democrats are especially likely to say so. About a third of Americans consider the recent shooting of a Congressman and others a terrorist attack.

CBS News

But importantly, Americans draw some distinctions between the political debate they decry, and the people themselves that hold opposing views. Most Republicans do not think of Democrats as threats to their way of life, but merely as people they disagree with on politics. Likewise, most Democrats feel the same about Republicans in this regard. There is a small core in each party, who do see other Americans across the political divide as threats to their way of life -- but they are not the majority.

CBS News

Given this, optimism still prevails, though not by a landslide. More believe that people of different political views are capable of working together than are pessimistic about the prospects.

CBS News

This poll was conducted by telephone June 15-18, 2017 among a random sample of 1,117 adults nationwide. Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Media, PA. Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones.

The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone.

Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables.

The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus four percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly.

200,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cell-phone-spam-and-scam-calls-are-spreading/,cbsnews,Spam and scam calls are going mobile,['Kathy Kristof'],"Cell phones used to be immune from the annoying scam and spam telemarketing robocalls that have bedeviled land line users for years. No longer.

More than half of cell phone users report having received a scam call in the past month. And repeated scam and spam calls to mobile phones have quadrupled over the past two years, according to a new survey.

Several factors can explain the increase, said Jonathan Sasse, chief marketing officer of First Orion Network Enterprise Solutions, which commissioned the study. More people are using their cell phones as a primary form of contact, thus sharing the numbers on everything from rent applications and resumes to website forms and contests. Some consumers also include their cell phone numbers in email signature lines.

""Once a mobile number is out there, scammers and telemarketers will find a way to call you,"" Sasse added. ""When it comes to scammers, these aren't legitimate companies following the rules. They're after your mobile number however they can get it, even if it means using auto-dialers to try any possible combination of phone numbers to target people.""

Moreover, the cost of random-dialing equipment has dropped ""to practically nothing,"" said John Oldshue, chief executive of SaveOnPhone, a cell phone shopping website. That's allowing offshore telemarketing ""boiler room"" operations to proliferate.

Roughly 80 million unwanted calls are made to cell phones each day. First Orion's latest survey, which polled 1,000 mobile phone users, found that over three-quarters of respondents received a scam call in the past year, a 15 percent increase from the company's previous survey in 2015.

However, 12 percent of consumers reported getting 20 scam calls or more in just the past six months -- a four-fold increase over the 3 percent who reported repeated scam calls in the previous survey.

Unfortunately, old-school solutions to junk calls, such as signing up for the Do Not Call Registry, are ineffective at handling the preponderance of today's scam and spam calling.

""The Do Not Call Registry is only effective in stopping legitimate telemarketers from calling you,"" said Oldshue. ""These guys set up calling centers in Bangladesh. They're not playing by the rules.""

The problems forced Niantic Inc., the developer of the wildly popular augmented reality game, to issue a statement saying everyone who registered for the event would get a full refund for the $20 tickets and $100 in credits for use of the app.]

Niantic CEO John Hanke was booed when he took the stage at Chicago's Grant Park to address the thousands of frustrated Pokemon enthusiasts.

Some in attendance had paid as much as $400 online for the tickets, which sold out within minutes of their June release. While no official attendance figures were available, organizers had planned for as many as 20,000 Pokemon players and ""trainers"" at the festival billed by Niantic as the first official anniversary event in the world.

Mark Haberkorn of Chicago, a member of the Official Pokémon Go 40 Club, an international online community of high-level players, said he started waiting in line for the opening of the festival at 6 a.m.

""The excitement has just been drastically minimized because of what we've experienced today,"" Haberkorn told the Chicago Tribune.

""They promised up wifi towers, they promised us all types of things and we come here and we're getting nothing. It's been terrible,"" Bobby Pegram, who drove from Virginia, told CBS Chicago.

One couple told CBS Chicago they spend over $1,000 for plane tickets, a hotel and a babysitter for the weekend.

Late in the day, Niantic's Chief Marketing Officer Mike Quigley tried to placate irritated players by announcing that everyone who scanned a code when they entered the park would automatically receive the Legendary Pokémon Lugia, a rare and powerful creature difficult to defeat in virtual battle and prized by Pokémon enthusiasts.

Niantic says Pokémon Go has been downloaded 750 million times since it was launched. The augmented reality game that uses GPS to locate, capture, battle and train virtual creatures was introduced in the United States in July 2016.

Editor's Note: In a previous story, The Associated Press misidentified one of the attendees as John Haberkorn. His name is Mark Haberkorn. This has been corrected."
202,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mickey-mouse-surprises-brother-and-sister-with-adoption-news/,cbsnews,Mickey Mouse helps parents surprise foster kids with adoption news,['Jennifer Earl'],"A recent trip to Disney World was more than magical for these young first-timers -- it was life-changing.

During a vacation to Disney's Magic Kingdom in April, 12-year-old Janielle and her 10-year-old brother Elijah learned they were both getting adopted.

The children, who had been living with their foster parents, Courtney and Tom Gilmour, for nearly three years, knew the day would come. But they never expected Mickey Mouse would be the one to deliver the news.

""We thought it would be so cool to be in the Magic Kingdom and slip Mickey a sign,"" Courtney told CBS News. ""He could show it to the kids and we would let them know their adoption date that way.""

As Courtney predicted, Janielle and Elijah were shocked.

During a private meet and greet arranged by the park, Mickey asked the kids to pose with him, holding up a sign that revealed their May 24 adoption date.

""Adoption..."" Elijah read out loud before gasping.

The siblings broke down into tears.

Courtney Gilmour

""Congratulations! That's awesome,"" Mickey said as he hugged a tearful Janielle.

""They were super surprised. They really thought they were just getting a picture and an autograph of Mickey,"" Courtney said. ""Everyone in our life knew the adoption date beside the kids. They had no idea.""

Courtney posted a 5-minute video of the emotional moment on Facebook last week, and it's now going viral with more than 1.5 million views.

""I've watched it about a million times and I cry every single time,"" Courtney said. ""It's a hard feeling to express, because we know we've given something that the kids desperately wanted. I'm happy, excited, nervous — all those things wrapped into one.""

Courtney Gilmour

Courtney and Tom started the process of becoming foster parents just one month after they got married.

""I was a foster child myself, so I always knew growing up I wanted to be a foster parent,"" Courtney. ""I knew the man I was going to marry had to be willing to be a foster parent.""

Fortunately for Courtney, he was.

Over the past three years, the couple has fostered 13 children, including Janielle and Elijah. The pair always volunteered to take in siblings, usually two at a time.

""I don't believe in breaking up sibling groups,"" Courtney said. ""You're already losing so much as a [foster] kid.""

Most of the kids they took in were younger and considered a ""short term placement."" Janielle and Elijah were different.

""When they came to us they were a little bit older and we were able to instill a bit of a bond,"" Courtney said. ""We spent time with them and clicked very quickly. They were already calling themselves Gilmours in school.""

The brother and sister had been in the foster system — on and off — for most of their lives. Now, after all of these years, Courtney hopes the kids will know what it's truly like to be part of a family.

""Letting the kids be normal is what helps us breathe,"" Courtney said. ""Foster care isn't easy. Even a simple thing such as going to sleepover party becomes this big ordeal, and they get embarrassed. Now they can live a normal life."""
203,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/report-brain-training-games-cognitive-benefits-claims/,cbsnews,Report challenges claims of cognitive benefits of online brain-training games,['Dr. Tara Narula'],"NEW YORK -- Can you keep your mind sharp -- as you age -- by playing so-called brain games?

A report Tuesday by AARP focused on what has become a $1.3 billion business.

Ads for online brain-training games tout their cognitive benefits saying they improve memory, brain speed and attention. But the report called the evidence behind these claims of cognitive benefits ""weak to nonexistent.""

Sarah Lock, executive director of the AARP's Global Council on Brain Health, shed light on the report.

CBS News

""They might get better at the game but what we don't know is how that's going to affect your everyday functioning,"" Lock told CBS News. ""So you might get better at the game but it's not going to help you manage your finances any better.""

Training to improve one type of cognitive ability -- like memory -- doesn't end up improving other skills such as how fast you process information.

And the report says there's often exaggerating when these products are marketed.

Last year, the FTC fined the makers of Luminosity $2 million for claiming its games could help users reduce or delay age-related cognitive impairment.

The good news is that cognitively stimulating activities are easy to find, such as learning a new skill. At the Greenwich House Senior Center, Betty Tiago is taking up art.

""I think anything creative helps to stimulate your brain,"" Tiago said.

CBS News

Other ideas to help improve cognitive benefits are activities that are novel and require focus and have a level of depth and engagement.

Some recommendations from the AARP include:

Educational opportunities (formal or informal including volunteering)

Learn new skill (music or language)

Leisure activities (playing cards, playing with children)

Mentally and physically stimulating activities (tennis and dancing)"
204,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/top-alzheimers-researcher-on-how-you-can-help-protect-you-brain/,cbsnews,Top Alzheimer's researcher explains how you can help protect your brain,['Ashley Welch'],"Every 66 seconds, someone in the United States develops Alzheimer’s disease.

Currently, more than 5 million Americans live with the memory-robbing ailment and by 2050 that number could rise as high as 16 million, according to new figures from the Alzheimer’s Association.

Scientists are working to find ways to not only treat Alzheimer’s but prevent it from developing in the first place. In one key step in the process, researchers are gaining a better understanding of the role of amyloid proteins in the development of the disease.

CBS News

“The amyloid plaques build up outside of the nerve cells [in the brain] and now we know that when the nerve cells interact with the plaque, it causes the nerve cell to make a tangle inside,” explains Rudy Tanzi, Ph.D., director of the Alzheimer’s Genome Project and a leading researcher in the field at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. “And that tangle then chokes the nerve cell from within and kills it. So the killing process begins with the amyloid – that’s kind of the gun – but the tangle’s the bullet, so to speak.”

Experts now believe these amyloid plaques and the tangles they form start occurring in people’s brains 10 to 15 years before any symptoms like memory loss begin to show.

The latest drug development efforts are focused on intervening much earlier on, before the disease takes an irreversible toll on memory and cognitive function. Tanzi likened it to taking statins to manage cholesterol to prevent a future heart attack.

Another increasingly important focus of medical research is neuroinflammation in the brain — why it happens, and how to stop it.

For patients with Alzheimer’s, Tanzi explained, “What’s killing most of your nerve cells is neuroinflammation, where the brain has reacted against all these plaques and tangles and cell death with an inflammatory response. And only over the last 5 years, we’ve discovered the genes that control neuroinflammation in Alzheimer’s and we’re doing drug discovery based on those as well.”

Yet, while such drugs can take years to develop, Tanzi says there are things people can do right now to help protect their brain. He spoke with CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook about these strategies.

Q: Aside from choosing the right parents, what can somebody do to prevent Alzheimer’s – or try to help prevent Alzheimer’s?

A: The four big categories are diet, exercise, sleep and stress reduction. I wrote about this in detail in my last book, “Super Genes” – six chapters, more than you wanted to know about how to adapt your diet to minimize inflammation and plaques.

Meaning Mediterranean diet, probiotics – take care of your gut bacteria.

Q: Which probiotics?

A: Yogurt, a yogurt drink like kefir, or a probiotic pill with live bacteria.

Q: But there’s so many different ones ... which ones? Do we know yet? We don’t know yet.

A: It’s a hot area right now. There are companies that are looking at what are the best bacteria to put in a probiotic.

Q: Why would what’s going on in your gut affect what’s going on in your brain?

A: So it turns out there’s what’s called a gut-brain axis, where the bacteria in your gut are creating chemicals that interact with your brain that do everything from determine your mood to control how much inflammation there is in your brain.

Q: And even obesity, right? It’s amazing what we’re learning about these trillions of bacteria that people were saying, ‘Oh, wash them out … I’m going to get a cleanse. They’re icky! Let’s get them out of us!’ It turns out, of course, millions of years of evolution – they’re there for a reason.

A: And you want to take care of them. They’re there to help you. A Mediterranean diet, more fiber, more fruit, what are called prebiotics, probiotics – meaning, if you don’t know exactly what probiotic pill to take, at least live-culture yogurt. I drink kefir every morning.

And then after diet – exercise. You know at least an hour-long brisk walk, or try to get 8,000 to 10,000 steps if you’re using a device.

And sleep. Eight hours. After 40 years old, you have to get seven to eight hours of sleep, and try your best to do it because as you cycle in and out of REM sleep, this is when you clean amyloid plaque out of your brain.

Q: That was one of the most amazing discoveries, when I first read about that – you’re actually ‘garbage collecting’ at night when you’re asleep. The toxins get carried out of your brain.

A: The brain – first of all, the cells that can cause inflammation, when they’re behaving are clearing the plaque. So you want to keep these certain cells clearing the plaque away and not causing inflammation. During the deep sleep, those cells eat all the plaque. And then the brain literally, physically constricts itself and releases the plaque debris – the proteins from the plaque – into the spinal fluid and out of the brain to wash away.

You can actually see the brain physically constricting after the material’s been broken down by the resident cells. And this only happens during delta – slow-wave – the deepest sleep that comes in after REM. So you want to be able to cycle in and out of REM several times per night. Kind of like a dishwasher on multiple cycles, you want to go in and out to clean the brain as much as you can every night with sleep.

Q: So it’s coming down to what our parents told us, right? Eat your fruits and vegetables, get a lot of exercise, get plenty of sleep. And then the last thing you said was stress reduction.

A: Managing stress. It turns out, we just published a study on meditation, a new trial on how does meditation affect your gene activity – your gene expression, as we call it.

We did it with folks at Mount Sinai [Hospital] in New York. And what we found was that with a meditation practice, there are changes in your gene expression that work against inflammation and that actually create a healthier state. We also see changes in genes that affect the amount of amyloid in your brain during a full one-week intensive meditation course.

So we have meditation instructors, we have novice meditators who are learning, and our control group of people at the same resort who were just hanging out and having fun but not learning how to meditate. And there were significant differences in terms of very beneficial gene expression changes in those who were meditating.

Q: One of the biggest fears my patients have is that they might be developing dementia. So how do you distinguish between a ‘senior moment’ and dementia? I mean, people would kind of flippantly say, if you can’t find your car keys that’s one thing, if you find them and don’t know what they do, that’s another thing. But I always found that a very flip answer. What do you really say to a patient in that situation?

A: Well the fact is, as we get older, we don’t recall names as well, we can see the face of an actor we know but can’t recall the name as fast. There are changes that happen in the brain just as there are changes in the muscles. Our joints, our muscles get a bit weaker. So that’s why it’s so important to work out physically and mentally. You know, stay engaged in learning new things.

Q: Crossword puzzles? Learning a new language?

A: I like to say – if crossword puzzles help you, if it’s the New York Times it would help you between Friday and Sunday, because you’d probably have to look something up and learn something new. But it’s really learning new things. When you learn something new, you make new synapses – connections between nerve cells [in the brain]. And all learning is based on what you already knew, you learn by association to what you already knew. So not only do you make new synapses, but you strengthen the ones you already have."
205,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/charlie-gard-parents-urged-make-end-of-life-plan-great-ormond-street-hospital/,cbsnews,Charlie Gard's parents urged to make end-of-life plan with hospital,[],"LONDON -- Critically ill baby Charlie Gard will be transferred to a hospice to die Thursday unless his parents and a hospital agree on an end-of-life plan that could potentially keep the child alive for a bit longer, a British judge has ruled.

High Court judge Nicholas Francis gave 11-month-old Charlie's parents and the hospital that has been treating him until noon Thursday to come to terms on a care plan for the infant's final hours or days.

The baby suffers from a rare genetic disease, mitochondrial depletion syndrome, which has caused brain damage and left him unable to breathe unaided. Recent tests found Charlie has irreversible muscular damage.

""It is in Charlie's best interests to be moved to a hospice and for him at that point to be moved to a palliative care regime only,"" the judge said as a medical and legal battle that has drawn international attention nears a wrenching conclusion.

Debate over Charlie's future became so heated that his doctors and hospital staff received death threats, CBS News correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti reports.

Family of Charlie Gard via AP

The parents, Connie Yates and Chris Gard, spent months trying to persuade Great Ormond Street Hospital to let Charlie go to the United States for experimental treatment. They gave up their fight on Monday, acknowledging that the window of opportunity to help him had closed.

On Tuesday, they said they hoped to bring their son, whose 1st birthday is next week, home to die. Francis said Charlie's mother and father now accept that the only options for their son ""are the hospital or the hospice.""

The Thursday deadline is meant to yield a plan for what happens after the baby is transferred to a hospice. The parents want him kept on his ventilator for a time. The hospital, in fighting the parents' earlier effort to secure experimental treatment, had indicated that it was responsible for sparing Charlie unnecessary pain.

Francis said if the parties do not reach an agreement, Charlie will be taken to hospice and the ventilation system keeping him alive will be turned off. He issued an order barring publication of the name of the hospice and the date when Charlie is taken there.

The judge said it was a ""very, very sad conclusion.""

Charlie's mother left the courtroom in distress before the judge gave his ruling.

""What if it was your child?"" Yates said amid sobs. As she left, she said: ""I hope you are happy with yourselves.""

In conceding that Charlie would leave the hospital for a hospice instead of home, Yates requested a medical team of her choosing that would work to keep her son alive for a week. He is not expected to survive for more than a few hours once his ventilator is removed.

The request indicated that the parents had backed away from their earlier expressed wish to take Charlie home for ""a few days of tranquility"" before his ventilator was disconnected and he was allowed to ""slip away.""

Great Ormond Street Hospital said it was not practical to provide life-support treatment for days at the couple's home. Nurses from the hospital nonetheless have volunteered to care for him in his final hours.

The parents' cause caught the attention of President Trump and Pope Francis and also garnered widespread grassroots support. U.S.-based pro-life activists have flown to London to support Charlie's parents.

The case has become the catalyst for discussions on health care funding, medical intervention, the role of the state and the rights of the child.

The heated commentary has prompted the judge to criticize the effects of social media and those ""who know almost nothing about this case but who feel entitled to express opinions."""

Police said Jordan C. Lamonde, 22, was arrested on Monday afternoon and charged with second-degree assault.

""This was a vicious, unprovoked attack that shocked our community, and I am proud to report that the suspect has been identified and apprehended,"" Police Chief Paul Toussaint said.

On June 12 at about 10 p.m., surveillance video shows the beginning moments of a man attacking 18-year-old Erin McCarthy from behind as she walked to her car.

Police said the Lamonde punched McCarthy 39 times and threw her to the ground.

McCarthy did not sustain major injuries despite the multiple blows.

""I mean, he threw me around like a rag doll, so I kind of just let it happen,"" McCarthy said last month.

About a month after the attack, police said they were still unable to make an arrest due to a company processing records for a search warrant related to the case though they had a strong suspect in mind.

McCarthy told CBS Boston she believes the attack was revenge for a dispute Lamonde had with her ex-boyfriend.

Police said he waited outside for McCarthy, who works inside, for nearly the entirety of her eight-hour shift.

Lamonde was held on $150,000 cash bail and will be arraigned on Tuesday at Strafford County Superior Court."

One of the most anticipated albums of the year had its inspiration underground, in the New York City subway.

For nearly a year, Lorde used the F Train as her mobile office: ""I love this train; it's my favorite,"" she said. ""I think it's okay to have a favorite train!""

""Did you actually do writing down here on the subway?"" Mason asked.

""Every day. Twice a day. I, like, thanked the subway in my album notes, because I wouldn't have been able to make the record without it. I found it such an amazing space to kind of be around people.""

CBS News

On her daily ride to the recording studio (usually unrecognized), the New Zealand-born singer worked on the words and music for ""Melodrama"" (below), the album she'll finally release this week.

Lava/Republic

""On the train there would be a lot of coming up with an idea and singing it into my phone, kind of as quietly as I could so no one would hear me.""

Mason asked, ""Did you freak out at all during the making of this record?""

""I definitely had real moments of true despair, like, This is terrible. I shouldn't be allowed to do this.""

The pressure was so great it took her four years to follow up the record that literally changed pop music: ""Royals.""

Ella Yellich O'Connor (Lorde's real name) was 15 and still turning in homework when she wrote ""Royals."" It spent nine weeks at #1 and earned her two Grammys.

David Bowie said listening to her music felt ""like listening to tomorrow."" But Lorde found the sudden fame an odd fit, claiming she's not very good at being famous.

""I'm not!"" she laughed. ""It's hard. It's all body language and, like, the subtlety, the angles -- I don't know the angles.""

She aspired to be an artist, not a star. Ella, who grew up in a suburb of Auckland, was fronting the high school band at age 12 and devouring books. ""Yeah, I had no friends and I read a ton of books,"" she laughed.

Her father is a civil engineer; her mother, a poet laureate.

""I remember being two and lying awake in my Mum's bed talking about our favorite fruits and why we love them,"" she laughed. ""There's a lyric on the album where I say, 'I am my mother's child.' I don't think I was ever going to be anything but an artist because of my Mum!""

Sonia Yellich still accompanies her 20-year-old daughter on her travels. She's remarked that Ella's head is always on fire. ""Oh, great!"" Lorde laughed.

Is it true? ""I don't know about on fire. It's definitely, there's such a current around me all the time.

""The way I go through the world and the way I see things, it's so, it's like in Technicolor. It's like magic to me and I feel like I have to get people to see what it is I'm seeing.""

Her sensitivity is heightened by a neurological condition called synesthesia, where sounds conjure colors and textures in her mind.

""And you see or feel what?"" Mason asked.

""It's like a colored gas that fills the room. It's pretty cool. It's pretty crazy!""

""Does it help your writing?""

""I think it definitely sends the writing in a certain direction. I think that I make the choices that I make with songs, in part, because of the synesthesia.""

To watch Lorde perform ""Green Light,"" from her album ""Melodrama,"" click on the video player below.

Mason asked, ""While you were making this record, you had a pretty big breakup.""

""Yeah. I was able to make a record about being alone, and celebrating that, and absolutely hating that. But being solitary was the thing that really unlocked the process.""

To watch Lorde perform ""Liability,"" from her album ""Melodrama,"" click on the video player below.

""You yourself have said this record in spots is a little weird,"" Mason said.

""It is kind of weird, yeah. I think about someone like David Bowie, and every record was such a pivot. And you know, you almost felt afraid of pressing play on a new record -- Am I gonna even understand this? And I think that throwing people into that sort of fear is, like, the most important thing you can do as an artist, long-term.""

The day Mason joined Lorde, she was headed to a rehearsal studio, where she began by jumping online to release her latest single.

""It's all happening, Anthony! It's up on Twitter. So weird!""

She was rehearsing for her appearance at last weekend's Governor's Ball Festival.

CBS News

""Are you as happy on stage as you are in the studio?"" Mason asked.

""I think I'm happiest in the studio. Stage is different because I get so nervous that it's like a weird trance,"" Lorde said. ""When I'm on stage I feel myself go right to the edge of the cliff, so to speak. If I broke my arm on stage, I wouldn't know, I don't think, because you're just so dialed into this crazy environment.""

After nearly four years away from that ""crazy environment,"" with her album release, Lorde returns this week.

""Do you feel ready to be back, if you will?""

""I don't know if I'll ever feel ready -- 'being back' is that thing we talked about of not being a very good famous person? But no. I'm ready to be in conversation with the world again.""

213,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ios-11-new-iphone-features/,cbsnews,Everything iOS 11 is going to bring to your iPhone,['Jessica Dolcourt'],"Apple just announced iOS 11 — the next version of its software to power your iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch — as its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) kicked off Monday.

The biggest changes come to Siri, Apple's voice assistant; some redesigns, like to the lock screen, App Store and Control Center; and augmented reality (AR) software that's going to mesh the virtual world onto your own.

All these updates and more will bring a wave of new features to your device, and — even more exciting to tech-watchers — to Apple's next iPhones. For that reason, iOS 11 is especially important. As the operating system set to power the hotly-anticipated 10th anniversary iPhone, changes to iOS drop some major hints about what the iPhone 8 (or whatever Apple calls it) will be able to do.

The iPhone is Apple's most popular device, and also its biggest moneymaker. (iPhones make up more than two-thirds of Apple's total sales, including laptops.) But phone sales have dropped in the past four out of five quarters, despite the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus's popularity. iOS 11 could help lure buyers by reinvigorating the software innards behind the next iPhone's hardware shell.

What's new in iOS 11

AR is coming to your iPhone and iPad

When you look at your iPhone or iPad screen, you'll be able to interact with virtual items overlaid in your real world. For example, you can place items like a lamp in your living room, or see Pokemon monsters on the sidewalk at your feet

Apple is just now launching the developer platform (called ARKit), so this isn't something you'll be able to use right away. (My guess is September when we expect Apple to launch its next iPhones.)

Why we care: This kind of deep software supports rumors that Apple is going to add a lot more computing power to the iPhone camera.

Siri wants to suggest what you want next

Siri can now translate languages (English to Chinese, French, German, Italian, Spanish for starters)

Suggest topics you'll want to know based on what you're doing

Siri will learn words from articles you use, and suggest them when you type

Make a calendar appointment based on what you searched on the web

Private, for you and your devices only (it won't be web accessible)

Why we care: Apple's Siri assistant has lagged behind Google's (and even Amazon's Alexa). Prediction and translation help close the gap a little.

Camera app changes mean more pics for you

Images will take up a lot less storage space thanks to new compression technology

Low-light photos using optical image stabilization

The two cameras on the iPhone 7 Plus captures depth info. Now devs can access that and use in apps

Live photos can now be trimmed

Why we care: The most important change is that you'll be able to save a lot more photos and videos.

Control Center shrinks to a single panel

One panel instead of three

3D Touch is going to let you dive in to more granular controls

Why we care: The three-panel layout was a drag. This should be easier to use by putting the controls we care about in one place, not three.

Lock screen and notification center become one

Scroll up to see notifications from the lock screen

Still get widgets on the left and camera on the right

Why we care: This should give you a more convenient glance at alerts.

Photos can get more dynamic

You can loop a live photo to make a movie (like, of a never-ending bubble blow)

You can grab and save a still frame from a video

New long exposure effect can help you take really great nature shots of moving water and more

Movies captured in ""Memories"" will now play in Portrait mode, not just landscape

Why we care: Nothing here really stands out yet, but looping a live video seems like an easy way to make a hilarious GIF.

iMessages will sync convos better

When you sync into another new device, iCloud will sync all your messages (which also means if you delete it on the iPhone, it'll delete on your laptop and iPad, etc.)



Why we care: Less clutter.

Use Apple Pay to pay your friends

Peer-to-peer payments are right in iMessage

You can make purchases and bank transfers

Authenticate with your fingerprint

iOS devices and Apple Watch 2

QuickType keyboard will suggest that you pay your friend... within the message

Why we care: You can pay your buddy back for dinner without having to sign into a new service. Easy.

Apple Maps dives indoors

214,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/total-solar-eclipse-august-21-2017/,cbsnews,"""Great American Eclipse"": Excitement builds for total solar eclipse Aug. 21",['William Harwood'],"On Aug. 21, the moon will slip between Earth and sun, casting a roughly 70-mile-wide shadow that will race across the United States from Oregon to South Carolina, giving tens of millions of Americans a chance to enjoy -- and study -- a fleeting but sublime spectacle, the first coast-to-coast total solar eclipse in 99 years.

It has been dubbed, appropriately enough, the ""Great American Eclipse.""

""It really is fortunate,"" said Matthew Penn, an astronomer with the National Optical Astronomy Observatory who is leading a nationwide effort to photograph the eclipse from 68 sites along the path of totality.

NASA

""The U.S. only covers 2 percent of the globe, so we get very few eclipses,"" he said. ""And to have one travel across the entire country is an unprecedented sort of opportunity. It'll be a heck of day. The best thing is, it can't be cloudy everywhere!""

The first inklings of what's to come will be visible from the Oregon coast, weather permitting, around 9:05 a.m. local time (12:05 p.m. EDT) when viewers with safety filters, from inexpensive cardboard ""solar glasses"" to more sophisticated aids, will see the moon begin to take a bite out of the sun, the start of a partial solar eclipse.

A partial eclipse will be visible across the entire United States, including Alaska and Hawaii, Canada, Central America and northern South America, with more than half of the sun obscured for residents across the lower 48 states.

But for millions of viewers who make their way into the narrow path of totality, a partial eclipse, a thrilling sight in its own right, will serve as an appetizer for the main course, the all-too-fleeting moments when the moon completely blocks out the sun.

Michael Zeiler, www.GreatAmericanEclipse.com

Moving across the Pacific Ocean at more than 2,400 mph, the dark inner heart of the moon's shadow -- the umbra -- will move ashore near Lincoln Beach, Ore., at 10:16 a.m. local time (1:16 p.m. EDT), and then sweep across 14 states and 20 national parks over the next hour and a half.

More than 200 million people live within a day's drive of the path of totality, potentially turning the Great American Eclipse into one of the most heavily viewed and shared events in recent memory.

""The Great American Eclipse on Aug. 21 is such an exciting event, it is a really singular and unique event in human history, really, where in the 21st century we have this amazing technology with social media,"" said Carrie Black, associate program director of the National Science Foundation's Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences.

""And it's happening across the United States, so the entire country can participate,"" she said. ""There's never been an event like this in human history where so many people could participate and with such unique technology.""

When the eclipse arrives

Two minutes and 145 miles after the leading edge of the moon's shadow crosses the coast of Oregon, a partial eclipse will begin in the small town of Madras at 9:07 a.m. local time (12:07 p.m. EDT). With clear skies the rule this time of year, thousands of tourists and astronomers, both amateur and professional, are expected to join 6,400 area residents to take in the show.

One hour and 12 minutes after the start of the partial eclipse, at 10:19 a.m., the moon will completely block out the sun above Madras, turning a bright morning into deep twilight for the next two minutes and two seconds.

Xavier M. Jubier

The temperature will drop, bright stars like Regulus will appear and the sun's super-heated corona will shimmer into view like a halo around the unseen moon. The light coming in from around the horizon, from beyond the edge of the moon's shadow, will appear in pinkish-orange hues like a 360-degree sunset.

""It's not as dark as night, for the most part,"" said Rick Fienberg a spokesman for the American Astronomical Society who holds a doctorate in astronomy. ""This one, the shadow's only about 70 miles wide. So 35 miles away from you, in every direction, it's light. The sky during a total solar eclipse is not black, it's blue.""

But the star of the show, so to speak, is the sun's corona, a magnetically energized region above the sun's visible surface -- the photosphere -- where the temperature suddenly -- and inexplicably -- climbs from about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit to nearly 4 million degrees.

Rick Fienberg / TravelQuest International / Wilderness Travel

The solar wind, a torrent of electrically charged particles, is accelerated to enormous velocities in the corona, spewing into space in all directions and reaching the farthest corners of the solar system. What drives the corona's extreme temperatures and accelerates the solar wind is a mystery, in part because the region is so difficult to study.

The inner regions of the corona can only be studied during a total solar eclipse when the moon completely blocks the sun's glare. Satellite instruments and ground-based telescopes create their own artificial eclipses, inserting a circular sun shade into a camera's light path that acts like a miniature moon.

But to keep from blinding sensitive detectors, such coronagraphs must block the sun's light out to more than a solar diameter. During a total solar eclipse, the actual moon does a much better job, revealing the corona's mysterious innermost regions.

""What's particularly special about a natural eclipse is that the moon is a perfect occulter, it blocks the surface of the sun just perfectly so you can see very low into the solar atmosphere,"" Black said. ""Scientists are particularly interested in the low corona, because that's where lots of activity is, that's where the origins of space weather are.""

With the Aug. 21 eclipse's coast-to-coast track across America, astronomers and citizen scientists will have a golden opportunity to learn more about the processes at work in the corona as millions along the path of totality get a chance to witness the sun's fiery halo.

NASA

""What you see is the jet black silhouette of the moon framed by the beautiful white of the corona, streaming out in all directions, usually several diameters of the sun away,"" Fienberg said. ""What makes it especially wonderful is the quality of the light, and the fact that the corona behaves like iron filings around a bar magnet, it traces the sun's magnetic field. So you see loops and streamers ... and it's just spectacular.

""And the light, the quality of the light is very unusual, too,"" he added. ""You're looking at glowing ionized gas, which is like what's in a fluorescent bulb or something, it's a mix of that and a mix of sunlight reflected off electrons and sunlight reflected off dust in the solar system, so it's a very different kind of light than ordinary daylight.""

Unlike the partial phases of a solar eclipse, when even a sliver of sunlight can cause eye damage if viewed for extended periods or any sort of optical aid, the fully eclipsed sun is safe to look at during the few minutes the moon completely covers the sun's disk.

Jay M. Pasachoff

""The total amount of light coming from the eclipsed sun, that's about as much light as comes from a full moon,"" Fienberg said. ""That's why we keep telling people, it's perfectly safe to look at the totally eclipsed sun. Once every last part of the sun's bright everyday face is covered, what's left, the corona, is about as bright as the full moon. So it's no more dangerous to look at.""

Fienberg will be in Madras with a tour group, his 13th trip to witness a total solar eclipse. His advice to first-time eclipse watchers: don't worry about telescopes or sophisticated optics. Just take in one of nature's grandest shows with the unaided eye.

""If you just look at it with a telescope, you're going to see the solar corona and you're going to see all kinds of interesting loops and streamers and things, but you're going to miss the broader effect. You might not see the sunset colors around the horizon, you might not realize how blue the sky is because in the telescope it'll just look black,"" he said.

""You won't see bright stars and planets that come out around the sun because they're going to be outside the field of view of the telescope. I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to alternate between using low-power binoculars and my naked eye.""

The view in binoculars is ""really breathtaking,"" he said, ""because you see a lot more detail in the corona, but you also see it in context, you see the whole sun and the whole corona and you get the bluish sky in the background.""

While it might seem contrary to countless warnings, using binoculars during totality, when the sun's light is completely blocked, is not dangerous in and of itself. And the observer will see clear signs totality is ending in plenty of time to look away and switch back to a filtered view.

But aside from the few minutes of totality, one should never look at the sun directly, experts warn, with or without optical aid, even during a nearly full partial eclipse, without using an internationally certified filter designed to reduce the sun's glare to a safe level.

""There's probably going to be an uptick in eye injuries no matter how much you tell people and how easy it is to get your hands on solar filters,"" Fienberg said. ""There are always people who will either ignore the messaging or just take unnecessary risks. But ... it's really hard to hurt yourself by looking at the sun too long. It's very uncomfortable.""

Cross-country path of eclipse

From Madras, the moon's shadow will race across Oregon and into Idaho, passing just north of Boise before moving on across Idaho Falls at 11:33 a.m. local time (1:33 p.m. EDT), Casper, Wyoming, at 11:42 a.m. (1:42 p.m. EDT), Grand Island, Nebraska, at 12:58 p.m. (1:58 p.m. EDT), St. Joseph, Missouri, at 1:06 p.m. (2:06 p.m. EDT) and nearby Columbia six minutes later. By this point, the shadow will have slowed to about 1,500 mph.

Residents of the northeast corner of Kansas City, just inside the path of totality, will enjoy about a minute of darkness around 1:08 p.m. (2:08 p.m. EDT) as will residents in southwestern St. Louis a few minutes after that.

Crossing the Mississippi River, the center of the moon's shadow will pass just south of Carbondale, Illinois, at 1:20 p.m. (2:20 p.m. EDT) before moving over Paducah and Hopkinsville, Kentucky, at 1:24 p.m. (2:24 p.m. EDT).

Along this stretch, eclipse watchers will enjoy the maximum duration of the eclipse, about two minutes and 40 seconds of totality.

From Kentucky, the shadow will move across Clarksville and then Nashville, Tennessee, the largest city in the path of totality, at 1:27 p.m. (2:27 p.m. EDT) crossing over the Smokey Mountains, the southwest corner of North Carolina and then racing over the heart of South Carolina where viewers in Greenville, Columbia, Charleston will enjoy totality between 2:38 p.m. and 2:47 p.m. EDT

The moon's shadow then will move off shore and out over the Atlantic Ocean, one hour and 33 minutes after the umbra crossed the coast of Oregon some 2,500 miles away.

Given its coast-to-coast track through the heartland of the United States, many observers believe the 2017 eclipse will be one of the most viewed in history and certainly the most scientifically studied.

""The other reason this is going to be so well observed is because we now live in a social media era,"" Fienberg said. ""Before, there were no smartphones, there was no Facebook, there was no Twitter. You have to literally be locked in an underground bunker to not be able to find out what's going on outside.

""So, everybody's going to hear about this, one way or another, and with any luck, they're going to get excited. ... Even if they don't make it into the path of totality, a deep partial eclipse, observed safely, can be fun.""

Williams College astronomer Jay Pasachoff, author of an article outlining planned eclipse research in the August issue of Scientific American magazine, plans to observe his 66th solar eclipse from the campus of Willamette University in Salem, Ore., along with an international team of researchers and a battery of telescopes, cameras and spectrographs.

""We've done preliminary versions of this before, but things get refined, the theoretical models get refined and the instruments get better,"" he said in an interview. ""We only have about two minutes, so you do the measurements you can. Each time we have an eclipse, the loops of gas, the shape of the corona, the magnetic field is different. So you want to take those couple of minutes whenever you can and find out what's going on there.""

Pasachoff team is one of scores that will be stationed along -- and above -- the path of totality. At least 11 NASA spacecraft will train their instruments on the sun, more than 50 high-altitude balloons will take photographs and study the effects of the eclipse on Earth's atmosphere, along with aircraft carrying a variety of instruments.

Hundreds of ground-based observatories will swing into action with numerous focused teams of researchers spread out along the path of totality. Veteran eclipse astronomer Shadia Habbal of the University of Hawaii will lead five such teams that, like Pasachoff's, will be studying the inner corona.

Penn is leading a team made up of more than 200 volunteers using identical telescopes, cameras and computers at 68 locations along the path of totality.

The goal of Penn's Citizen CATE (Continental-America Telescopic Eclipse) project is to assemble a carefully calibrated movie of the eclipse to learn more about how the sun's magnetic field accelerates particles in the corona. Data will be collected using identical telescopes, cameras and computers operated by volunteers, including students and astronomy club members.

""The thing that excites me the most about this eclipse is that millions of people across the country, in the path of totality, can walk out on their porch in their slippers and collect world-class data,"" Penn said. ""They won't have to travel to a large telescope on top of a mountain, you can go into your backyard using fairly modest-size instruments and collect really important research data.""

A more public project, the Eclipse Megamovie, is led by Hugh Hudson, a solar physicist at the University of California at Berkeley. His team is soliciting imagery from volunteers ""as an outreach thing,"" he said, ""and make a big movie that incorporates all the images.""

""It will be complicated, but in principle you can ... create an actual movie,"" he said. ""That's never been done before as far as I can tell, and this is a wonderful opportunity for us.""

In an interview, Pasachoff advised the public to take in the partial phases of the eclipse with low-cost solar filters. For viewers in the path of totality, ""just keep looking through them and when that presence diminishes and becomes invisible through the glasses you put the glasses down and watch for a couple of minutes.""

""If you want to look up in those two minutes, which is between two minutes on the Oregon coast on the central line and two minutes 40 seconds in Illinois, then you can glance with binoculars for a few seconds to see some of the detail in the corona. But it's also nice to look around the sky and see what stars and planets you can see and look at that sunset effect on the horizon all around you.""

The shape of the corona changes during the sun's 11-year sunspot cycle as the number of spots wax and wane. The sun currently is moving into the minimum phase of the cycle ""and that means that the corona will be very extended at the sun's equator and it won't hide the plumes of hot gas, the million-degree-gas, that's coming out of the poles,"" Pasachoff said.

""So we'll have an opportunity to study this gas at the poles for the first time in about eight or 10 years.""

For eclipse novices taking in their first total solar eclipse, Pasachoff said astronomers will ""be glad to give you our pictures.""

""Don't cut into your enjoyment by being too busy with your camera, just watch,"" he said, echoing Fienberg's advice.

Does the view ever get old?

""No, it gets better and better,"" he said.

Will weather conditions cooperate?

But all that assumes the weather cooperates. Canadian meteorologist and eclipse enthusiast Jay Anderson has produced a chart based on more than 15 years of data to give a sense of how much cloud cover might be expected in late August along the path of totality.

In Madras, for example, eclipse chasers can expect average cloud cover between around 15 and 20 percent. Moving east, cloud cover generally increases depending on topography and other factors. In Nashville, up to 70 percent of the afternoon sky can be cloud covered.

But as Fienberg noted, climate is what one expects, weather is what one actually gets, ""the idea being that you can predict the statistical likelihood of clear skies based on past history, but weather is a very local phenomenon.""

That said, ""the northwest is going to have a much better chance of clear skies than the southeast.""

""And so, many of the people who are going to be making a sincere effort to see totality are going to be heading to the northwest,"" he said. ""Oregon is very popular, Wyoming, Idaho and Nebraska, all through those states the path of totality is predicted to be 80 percent or 70 percent chance of clear skies. The only exception being the Oregon coast itself.""

The weather might be better in the northwest, but because of the moon's orbital track and changing distance from the Earth, totality will last longer in the southeast.

""Two minutes and 40 seconds in southern Illinois and western Kentucky, whereas it's only going to be a couple of seconds over two minutes in Oregon,"" Fienberg said. ""You want to go where the eclipse will be long, so you tend to go to the point where it's maximum and as close to the center of the path as you can. But you also want to go where the weather prospects are good.

""In this case, a lot of people are going to the northwest,"" he said. ""Even though the eclipse won't be as long, the chance of clear skies is better.""

And if the weather doesn't cooperate, your car breaks down or your flight is canceled before you can reach the path of totality, you'll get a second chance in 2024 due to the nature of the moon's orbit and Earth's path around the sun.

During the 2024 eclipse, the moon's shadow will cross the U.S. border in southern Texas and move up into the eastern half of the United States, passing over Dallas-Fort Worth, Cleveland, Ohio, Buffalo, New York, and Montreal.

The moon will be closer during the 2024 eclipse, its shadow will be wider and totality will last more than four minutes along most of its track across the United States. The paths of the 2017 and 2024 eclipses will cross near Carbondale, Illinois, where residents will witness their second bout of totality in just six and a half years.

""So if you can't get to totality this time, you're going to see all the pictures and movies on the internet, you're going to hear from people who went, you're going to be really motivated for the next one,"" Fienberg said. ""And you've got six and a half years to plan for it."""

Is it a case of cause and effect? Anna Werner has been investigating the phenomenon known as ""cancer clusters"":

Dr. Thomas Sherman is on the hunt for a killer.

""To get there we'll come up Grove Road, Washington Road, and we'll go right up here,"" he told Werner. ""Here's where the landfill is, where this arrow is.""

CBS News

He's heading a task force investigating why several children in the Seacoast region of New Hampshire developed a rare cancer, called rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), the cancer that took the life of Paul Thomas' 14-year-old son, Sam.

""It's something missing in your life, and it'll always be there,"" Thomas said.

Paul and his wife, Lynne, say two years after Sam's death, the questions persist.

""In your head you're like, why are there three cases, that you can go off at the top of your head, in the Seacoast area? Why?"" Lynne said.

The state says it's a cancer cluster, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines as ""a greater-than-expected number of cancer cases that occurs within a group of people in a geographic area over a period of time.""

And while that definition may be black-and-white, it turns out that almost everything else is anything but.

State health departments get an average of a thousand reports of alleged clusters every year, but historically, only a handful are ultimately recognized as true residential cancer clusters.

One of those is the 1980s case of Woburn, Massachusetts, a story told by the book and movie, ""A Civil Action."" More than 20 cases of leukemia in children were linked to chemical contamination of the public water supply, according to epidemiologist Suzanne Condon, who investigated for the state.

Werner asked, ""How hard is it to figure out if something really is a cancer cluster?""

""I've been asked that before, and my standard response is, extraordinary difficult at best,"" Condon replied.

Toms River, New Jersey is another recognized case. But some other notorious incidents, often thought to be cancer clusters, were not. That includes the California events depicted in the movie ""Erin Brockovich,"" and the infamous Love Canal case in upstate New York.

Investigators have to consider several factors, including: How often the cancer occurred; how long it took for it to develop; whether genetics might play a role; and one more thing ... chance.

""It seems like people want to say, 'It just can't be a coincidence,"" said Werner.

""I think people have a hard time understanding that sometimes there are random patterns of disease, and things can happen because of chance,"" Condon said.

And as for the Seacoast cancer cluster? ""I think they have an incredible challenge before them,"" she suggested.

So far, Dr. Sherman and others are focusing their questions on an old closed landfill where, they say, the military and others dumped toxic wastes.

New Hampshire officials say they have found chemicals used to make commercial products in some wells near the landfill. But they say there's no proof they are linked to the suspected Seacoast cancer cluster, and those responsible for the landfill deny there's any connection.

But the Thomases still hope for an answer, one they hope might save someone else's child.

""These rare cancers are out there,"" said Lynne. ""And I really think that that has to be looked at, so that Sam's death was not in vain.""

223,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-brothers-rosenberg-cold-war-spying-2/,cbsnews,Sons of Cold War spies reinvestigate their parents' case,['Anderson Cooper'],"It was called ""The Crime of the Century,"" one of the most famous espionage cases of the Cold War. In 1953, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were sent to the electric chair for conspiring to provide the secrets of the atomic bomb to the Soviet Union. They left behind two little boys, Robert and Michael, just 6 and 10 years old at the time.

The brothers Rosenberg were the orphans of Communist spies at the height of the McCarthy era. Relatives were afraid to take them in. One town blocked them from attending its schools. What ever happened to those two little boys? It's a remarkable story, a piece of American history that hasn't been fully told.

CBS News

Anderson Cooper: People would ask you?

Michael Meeropol: Oh yeah, ""Are you related to those two spies?"" ""No."" But I really hated myself.

""We were the children of Communist spies. Being the Rosenberg's children in 1950 was almost like being Osama bin Laden's kids here after 9/11.""

Anderson Cooper: Hated yourself because you were—

Michael Meeropol: I was denying-- I was too scared to-- admit that my parents were my parents.

Robert Meeropol: We were the children of Communist spies. Being the Rosenberg's children in 1950 was almost like being Osama bin Laden's kids here after 9/11.

Today, they're known by their adopted names, Michael and Robert Meeropol, but in 1950, they were Michael and Robby Rosenberg, ages 7 and 3, living in New York City's Lower East Side, with their parents Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The Rosenbergs were ardent Communists but Michael doesn't recall his parents ever using that word. Ethel was a stay-at-home mom who loved to sing. Julius – an engineer who ran a small machine shop. That's Michael on his shoulders.

Michael Meeropol: My father would take me to places like Prospect Park and, you know, get some peanuts and feed squirrels.

Anderson Cooper: What was he like?

Michael Meeropol: He was very energetic. He had a smile on his face a heck of a lot of times. And I remember traveling around with him. In fact, I rode on the subway with him so often that I kind of wondered, you know, when he was working.

Anderson Cooper: And your mom? What was she like?

Michael Meeropol: She was very affectionate. A lot of hugging and kissing. And I remember that she was often cooking. The thing I remember is just a normal life.

But then, in the summer of 1950, FBI agents began rounding up a network of alleged Communist spies. On July 17th, they knocked on the Rosenbergs' door.

AP

Michael Meeropol: I'm listening to ""The Lone Ranger."" And the door opens. And there is all these people in the room, who, you know, I guess-- friends of daddy's. But then my mother yells, ""I had-- I want a lawyer."" And I knew something was weird. And then the radio's turned off. Well, I'm a brash 7-year-old and I turned it back on. Somebody turned it off again. After about three times, I gave up, 'cause, you know, the attention was on my father. And then he disappears. He's gone.

Julius was accused of running a spy ring that tried to help the Soviet Union make an atomic bomb. After he refused to talk to the FBI, Ethel was arrested too.

Michael Meeropol: All I remember is I'm on the phone with her. And she says, ""I'm under arrest."" And I say, ""You can't come home?"" She says, ""No, I can't."" And I don't remember anything else about the phone call, but the story is that I screamed and that it gave her nightmares for the rest of her life.

Anderson Cooper: That scream?

Michael Meeropol: Yeah. It tore her heart.

Their grandmother put them up for a few months, but Michael and Robby say she resented their presence. When other relatives refused to care for them, they were sent to a children's shelter in the Bronx.

Anderson Cooper: Why didn't other family members take you in?

Robert Meeropol: They were terrified. Like, for instance, my father's older sister wanted to take us in. But her husband owned a small grocery store. And he said, ""If people find out I've taken in the children of the Rosenbergs-- they won't buy food from my store.""

Anderson Cooper: So then you're sent, essentially, to an orphanage?

Michael Meeropol: Yeah.

Anderson Cooper: What was that like?

Michael Meeropol: I remember it as horrible. Like something out of Dickens. The staff was pretty free with the slaps and the abuse. I felt like I was in prison.

Anderson Cooper: You felt like you were in prison, as well, not just--

Michael Meeropol: Yeah. Oh, absolutely.

Anderson Cooper: --your parents?

Michael Meeropol: One week after I was there, I remember crying to anybody I would talk-- I said, ""I've been here a week. Don't you think they could let me go home now?""

The chief witness against their parents was their uncle, David Greenglass, who'd worked at the military's atomic bomb-making plant in Los Alamos, New Mexico. In March 1951, Greenglass testified he'd given sketches of the atomic bomb to Julius Rosenberg, and that Ethel had typed up his handwritten notes. David Greenglass's wife Ruth told the same story under oath. It took the jury only eight hours to reach a verdict.

[NEWSREEL: Headline: Death to A-Spies. Rosenbergs Get Top Penalty In Atom Trial: One of the greatest peacetime spy dramas in the nation's history reaches its climax.]

The judge sentenced the Rosenbergs to death, saying he considered their crime worse than murder, because he believed they'd put the atomic bomb in Soviet hands earlier than anyone had expected. While their lawyers appealed the decision, the Rosenbergs were taken to New York's Sing-Sing prison to await execution. Robby and Michael, now 4 and 8 years old, hadn't seen their parents for a year, but they were allowed to visit them at Sing-Sing.

Anderson Cooper: I heard that you asked to see the electric chair?

Michael Meeropol: Yep. The very first visit I said to a guard, ""Let me see the electric chair.""

Anderson Cooper: Why did you want to see the electric chair?

Michael Meeropol: I didn't want to see the electric chair. I wanted to prove to the people at the prison I wasn't afraid of it.

Robert Meeropol: I remember that the prison seemed like a big fortress that we were entering, this gray stone building, almost medieval like. But when we went into the visiting room, everything was kind of quiet and calm, which is what I needed. And I think that's because my parents made a conscious effort, to try to act that way. And so you could say that they fooled me. And I wanted to be fooled.

Michael Meeropol: I remember asking them both in Sing-Sing if they were innocent. I said, ""Are you really innocent?"" And they reacted, ""But of course we are,"" you know? And that was enough for me for, you know decades.

But it wasn't enough for the Supreme Court, which denied the Rosenbergs' appeal. Never before in the U.S. had a husband and wife been sentenced to the electric chair, which would make their children orphans. The Rosenbergs' supporters held protests all over the world, arguing the couple was innocent and the sentence unjust. Albert Einstein, Pablo Picasso, and the pope appealed for clemency. Days before the scheduled execution, Michael and Robby joined demonstrators in Washington, D.C., and hand-delivered a plea for mercy to the White House. But President Eisenhower refused to intervene. On June 16th, 1953, -- nearly three years after their parents had been arrested -- the boys visited them at Sing-Sing for the last time.

Michael Meeropol: And as I was leaving, I started to wail, ""One more day to live. One more day to live.""

Anderson Cooper: You actually said that--

Michael Meeropol: Oh yeah, absolutely. It was terrible, you know? But it was-- it was honest. I mean basically, I was pissed off, because they were kissing us goodbye like, ""See you next time."" And I thought, you know, ""They-- they should take-- make th-- a more big deal about this. 'Cause this could be forever.""

The attorney general said the couple could still save themselves by providing information to investigators. But Julius and Ethel Rosenberg remained united in silence. As the hours of execution approached, reporters converged on the prison, and protestors gathered near New York's Union Square. Robby and Michael, now 6 and 10 years old, stayed at the home of a family friend in New Jersey, playing baseball and hoping for a last minute reprieve, which never came.

Michael Meeropol: I played catch 'till it was too dark to see the ball. And when I came in, I asked the adults what happened. And they wouldn't tell me. They just said, ""We listened to every radio station. They all said the same thing."" And so I knew. I got hugged by the woman who we were staying with. And she said, ""You'll stay with us."" And I said, ""Yeah, I guess I will."" And-- they said, ""Let's keep it from Robby."" And so I kept it from him for a week.

Anderson Cooper: For a week?

Michael Meeropol: Yeah. Well, I couldn't, I just couldn't-- for what reason or another, I just couldn't go on with the charade.

Anderson Cooper: Do you remember exactly what you said?

Michael Meeropol: Yeah. 'Cause he was talking about, ""When Mommy and Daddy come home."" And I said, ""Oh, come on, let's tell him….Rob, Robby…""-- he was always Robby --""Mommy and Daddy aren't coming home. They're dead.""

Anderson Cooper: Do you remember what he said?

Michael Meeropol: He acted as if he didn't understand.

Robert Meeropol: I think I've had to work my entire life at reacting to bad news, 'cause my first tendency whenever bad news comes is to pretend like it's not that bad somehow. And, you know, if you can do that with your parents being executed, you can do that with almost anything.

The Rosenberg's supporters viewed them as martyrs persecuted for their Communist belief. But to the vast majority of Americans, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were atomic spies and traitors. Many believed they deserved to die.

Michael Meeropol: When my parents were killed, an-- a postcard came to the place I was staying. And it said, ""Of course you feel for the loss of your parents, but when you think of all the boys they killed in Korea, you must realize that justice was done. Why don't you change your names and become Christians?""

Anderson Cooper: And you remember the words to this day?

Michael Meeropol: Well, those are the kind of words that you don't forget.

Anderson Cooper: In so many of the photos of you both at that time, your brother is-- his arm is around you or both arms are around you like he's protecting you.

Robert Meeropol: He was my anchor, you know, rather than sibling rivalry, it was more of, like, the two of us against the world.

Anderson Cooper: Who do you think this was harder on? You or Robby?

Michael Meeropol: I think it probably was much harder on Robby, because three years with my parents, what are his memories? He has very little to grab onto.

Robert Meeropol: I think it was harder on him. I think he had a tremendous sense of responsibility for me. And he understood more.

It had been quite a while since anything good had happened to the Rosbenberg boys. But in 1953, not long after their parents' funeral, they were introduced to Anne and Abel Meeropol, teachers who were supporters of the Rosenbergs. They took Michael and Robby into their home and eventually adopted them.

[Dictaphone recording: Introducing the Meeropol family….Robby Meeropol and yours truly! [singing] This land is your land, this land is my land…]

Anderson Cooper: The Meeropols became your parents?

Michael Meeropol: Absolutely. Totally.

Anderson Cooper: They changed your life?

Michael Meeropol: Yeah. They saved our lives.

Robert Meeropol: Within a few months of living with them, I was calling them Mommy and Daddy.

Anderson Cooper: Was it your choice to take their name?

Robert Meeropol: Well, I was too young to really have a choice. But it made us more anonymous. And that was a good thing.

As Michael and Robby Meeropol, they eventually went to college, got married, and started raising families of their own.

Robert Meeropol: I think it's no accident that both of us got married when we were young. That we both had two kids, just like we were two kids. As early as we could, we recreated the family that was torn apart.

Michael Meeropol became an economics professor. Robert, a lawyer and founder of a charity called the Rosenberg Fund for Children. They lived relatively normal lives. But for many years, most of the people they interacted with each day had no idea they were the children of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.

Robert Meeropol: Essentially, I was in the closet from when I was 6 until when I was 20 with everybody who didn't already know.

Anderson Cooper: You were worried about letting the world know who you were?

Robert Meeropol: Yeah, I was, because whenever-- when the world knew who I was, it was very bad. Terrible things happened.

More than 20 years after their parents' execution, the brothers decided to step back into the limelight and reinvestigate the Rosenberg case. What they discovered when we come back.

Before Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed for conspiring to provide atomic secrets to the Soviet Union, Ethel wrote a letter to their sons Michael and Robby saying, ""always remember that we were innocent."" So perhaps it's not surprising that when the boys grew up, they wanted to try to clear their parents' names. What is surprising is how much new information they and independent historians have been able to uncover over the years -- secret messages, intercepted cables, long-forgotten files from the archives of the FBI, the CIA, and the KGB. The new information has changed the way this chapter of American history is viewed and, last year, the brothers asked President Obama to exonerate their mother.

The little boys who disappeared from public view after their parents were executed in 1953, re-emerged as grown men in 1975 determined to uncover new information in their parents case. They sued the FBI and the CIA under the Freedom of Information Act, seeking full access to the government's files on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.

[Robert Meeropol at press conference: The government files represent the largest body of primary evidence on my parents' case in existence. We are not afraid of what is in them. Why is the government afraid? What are they trying to cover up?]

Anderson Cooper: Did you think you might be able to prove your parents' innocence?

Michael Meeropol: Oh, absolutely. I was absolutely convinced that we would find virtual proof.

Anderson Cooper: You were sure they were innocent?

Robert Meeropol: As sure as one-and-one equal two.

They formed a committee to re-examine the Rosenberg case. Ron Radosh was among the first to sign up. At the time, he was an author and activist, highly sympathetic to the Rosenbergs' cause and eager to help.

Ron Radosh: By then I had a phD in history and I believed, my expertise as a historian enabled me to want to go through all these files that I expected would prove their innocence.

But once Ron Radosh started going through the FBI files, he realized he was wrong: Julius Rosenberg had been a Soviet spy -- and a zealous recruiter of others.

Ron Radosh: I was stunned. It became readily apparent, that this was not people who were arrested because they opposed the Korean War or whatever, because they wanted peace.

Anderson Cooper: Essentially--

Ron Radosh: So--

Anderson Cooper: --Julius Rosenberg's job was as a recruiter of others? He was--

Ron Radosh: Right, he--

Anderson Cooper: --developing a network--

Ron Radosh: --ran a network. He put it together and handled them all.

In 1983, Ron Radosh co-wrote a book outlining the new evidence that Julius Rosenberg was guilty.

Anderson Cooper: How did the Meeropols and others on the left respond?

Ron Radosh: Horrendously. I mean, I was ostracized, attacked.

Anderson Cooper: People stopped speaking to you?

Ron Radosh: Yeah. I had phone calls in the middle of the night, death threats, the usual thing. I mean-- and we lost-- actually lost good friends, very good friends. Who no longer stopped talking to us, and to this day.

Anderson Cooper: To this day?

Ron Radosh: Oh, absolutely.

It took Michael and Robby a long time to accept that their father was guilty. They finally acknowledged it in 2008, when their parents' co-defendant Morty Sobell admitted for the first time he had been part of Julius Rosenberg's spy ring.

Anderson Cooper: Was there any part of you that was disappointed in your father?

Michael Meeropol: No. No. Not at all.

Anderson Cooper: Not disappointed that he actually did commit espionage?

Michael Meeropol: I'll speak for myself. No, I-- I didn't.

Robert Meeropol: You know, for years we were saying our parents were innocent lambs brought to slaughter. And to come to the realization that, instead, they were knowing political actors who made decisions based upon their beliefs, I actually found that to be more palatable. I didn't want them to just be victims.

Anderson Cooper: But your father was breaking U.S. law--

Michael Meeropol: Absolutely.

Anderson Cooper: --to do this. So--

Michael Meeropol: Yeah, he was.

Robert Meeropol: And I think that if he'd been arrested and given a five or 10-year prison sentence, we would have nothing to complain about.

There's now plenty of evidence that Julius Rosenberg's spy network stole important technology for jet fighters, radar, and detonators. But the one thing he and his spies didn't do a very good job of stealing was atomic secrets – the heart of the prosecutors' case. Most historians agree that the Soviets got the most important atomic bomb-making information from Los Alamos scientists Klaus Fuchs and Theodore Hall, who belonged to a different Russian spy ring.

The Los Alamos informant Julius was accused of recruiting, Ethel's brother David Greenglass, was a machinist, not a scientist. When a copy of the sketch Greenglass said he drew for the Soviets was made public in 1966, nuclear scientists were not impressed.

Michael Meeropol: 1966, top scientists look at it, and they make it clear that this thing is a secret of nothing. It's got no dimensions in it. It's got errors in it.

Newspapers called Julius and Ethel Rosenberg ""atomic spies"" and the judge sentenced them to death for putting the atomic bomb in the hands of the Soviet Union. But there's ample evidence the U.S. government knew at the time that the information David Greenglass gave to the Soviets was of minor value.

Anderson Cooper: The prosecutors knew the information the Rosenbergs had access to was not the-- the crown jewels of the atomic world?

Ron Radosh: Yes. But they were pushing for a prosecution without using the hardest evidence they could-- they had. Couldn't be used.

That's because in the 1940s the U.S. government had been secretly intercepting Soviet messages, and it didn't want the Soviets to know it had broken their code. So instead, prosecutors pressured David Greenglass and his wife Ruth, to testify against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Michael and Robby argue that prosecutors framed their mother by inventing evidence that she typed up David Greenglass' notes on the atomic bomb.

[Greenglass: Where do I sit? Right there?]

[Voice [off camera]: Yes, sir.]

In 2001, half a century after he testified that his sister typed up his notes, David Greenglass told 60 Minutes correspondent Bob Simon it was a lie.

Bob Simon: So Ethel finally went to the electric chair on the basis of evidence that was false.

David Greenglass: False.

He said he did it to save himself and his wife, and he showed little remorse.

David Greenglass: We're still here. I didn't have to go away, nobody killed me and I survived.

Bob Simon: Your sister didn't.

David Greenglass: You know, I'd like to say something: I would not sacrifice my wife and my children for my sister. How do you like that? My wife is more important to me than my sister.

Greenglass said he was pressed to give this false testimony by one of the prosecutors in the case, Roy Cohn, who would go on to become Senator Joseph McCarthy's right-hand man and was later disbarred for unethical conduct.

Bob Simon: Did Cohn encourage you to testify that you saw Ethel typing up the notes?

David Greenglass: Of course, he did.

As a reward for their testimony against the Rosenbergs, David Greenglass got a reduced sentence and his wife Ruth, who had served as a Soviet courrier, never spent a day in prison. Prosecutors believed the prospect of Ethel dying in the electric chair, would force Julius Rosenberg to confess and name other Soviet spies.

Michael Meeropol: In the case of my mother, she really is collateral damage, you know, this is -- this is the government trying…putting a gun to her head and saying to Julie ""Talk or we'll kill her.""

Anderson Cooper: You don't think she was involved at all?

Michael Meeropol: We don't believe that, and in fact we believe that the evidence has virtually proved that.

After David and Ruth Greenglass died, their testimony to a grand jury before the Rosenberg's trial was unsealed. There was no mention of Ethel Rosenberg typing up David Greenglass' notes and when those Soviet messages the U.S. had been secretly decoding were publicly released, they showed the Soviets had never given Ethel Rosenberg a code name. In 1997, when Julius Rosenberg's former Soviet handler Alexander Feklisov went public with tales of Julius' spy missions for the Soviet Union, Feklisov had this to say about Ethel Rosenberg:

Alexander Feklisov: Ethel never worked for us. She didn't do anything.

Based on this information, Robert and Michael Meeropol launched a campaign to clear their mother's name. In 2015, they got 13 members of the New York City Council to issue a proclamation declaring the government wrongfully executed Ethel Rosenberg.

Robert Meeropol: It is time for the federal government to step up and do the same.

Last year, they've launched an online petition drive, callling on President Obama to exonerate their mother before he leaves office. But historian Ron Radosh says, based on the documents he's seen, that would be a mistake.

Ron Radosh: She was an accessory to spying by helping, identifying people, urging people to be recruited, suggesting that her own brother be recruited, this is aiding those who are spying. It's aiding and abetting.

Anderson Cooper: You're saying even though she wasn't as involved as her husband, she still engaged in a conspiracy--

Ron Radosh: Yes. She considered herself a friend of the Soviet Union, was doing-- helping her husband in his valuable work.

Anderson Cooper: So the trial was not fair, but that doesn't mean the Rosenbergs were innocent--

Ron Radosh: Right. Right. You could say-- if you want to say those who say the Rosenbergs were framed, they framed guilty people.

Anderson Cooper: But you are acknowledging there was an injustice when it comes to Ethel in terms of the death penalty?

Ron Radosh: Yes. Yeah. Sh-- compared to the others, she was of minimal importance. She should not have been executed. The government did it as a mechanism of leverage, hoping that would push Julius to talk. It didn't work. And I think they were shocked that it didn't work. I th-- they all thought Julius would break and cooperate.

Anderson Cooper: When Judge Kaufman sentenced them to death, he said the Rosenbergs loved their cause more than their children. Do you think that's true?

Ron Radosh: Yes. Unfortunately, I would agree with that. Yes. Otherwise, how could they have done what they did?

Anderson Cooper: You've said that your mother was a hostage who was killed when your father wouldn't talk. Isn't it true though that she could have told investigators everything she knew and lived?

Robert Meeropol: Both our parents could've saved themselves.

Michael Meeropol: No question--

Robert Meeropol: The F.B.I. agents who've written memoires in which they said, ""We didn't want them to die. We wanted them to talk.""

Anderson Cooper: After your father had been executed, could she have then--

Michael Meeropol: Absolutely.

Anderson Cooper: --last minute--

Michael Meeropol: Exac--

Anderson Cooper: --said, ""You know what? I'll tell you everything I know""?

Michael Meeropol: Absolutely. In fact, we know that the rabbi came to her cell after witnessing our father's execution and said, ""Julius is gone and, you know, you have two children. And if there's anything you can say, a name, even a false name, just anything, you know, to save yourself."" And allegedly, she said to the rabbi, ""I have no names. I'm innocent and I'm ready.""

Robert Meeropol: Ultimately, they couldn't betray each other. They couldn't and they would not betray each other. And that would've been the ultimate betrayal.

""...the fact that the government facilitated the invention of evidence in order to convict someone of a capital crime, that is something that should concern everybody.""

Anderson Cooper: Do you feel she betrayed you?

Robert Meeropol: N-- not at all.

Anderson Cooper: The judge said, ""Your parents loved their cause more than their own children,"" which is certainly a very cruel thing to say--

Robert Meeropol: And it's not true.

Anderson Cooper: You don't believe by--

Robert Meeropol: I don't--

Anderson Cooper: --by choosing to die rather than cooperate, they didn't prove the judge right?

Robert Meeropol: No, I don't think they did. If you were interviewing us in a psychiatric ward-- then you might say, ""Yeah-- they-- they damaged us by what they did.""

Anderson Cooper: To you exoneration would mean what? Is it political or is it personal?

Michael Meeropol: Both.

Robert Meeropol: Oh, it's both. Our mother was killed for something she did not do. She was taken away from us. That's as personal as it can get. But, the fact that the government facilitated the invention of evidence in order to convict someone of a capital crime, that is something that should concern everybody.

Since our story first aired, more than 50,000 people signed an online petition calling for Ethel Rosenberg to be exonerated. In December, the brothers went to the gates of the White House to plead their case, just as they had done as boys. But President Obama never responded to their request, and the brothers told us they don't plan on asking President Trump.

224,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/senators-recorded-on-hot-mic-im-worried/,cbsnews,Senators recorded on hot mic: “I’m worried”,['Blair Guild'],"Two senators were complaining that the White House is paying insufficient attention to the budget process, apparently unaware that their microphones were still on after a Senate subcommittee meeting Tuesday.

Sen. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, began discussing federal budget proposals.

""I swear, [the Office of Management and Budget] just went through and whenever there was 'grant,' they just X it out,"" Collins said. ""With no measurement, no thinking about it, no metrics, no nothing. It's just incredibly irresponsible.""

""Yes, I think — I think he's crazy,"" Reed said. ""I mean, I don't say that lightly and as a kind of a goofy guy.""

When asked later by CBS News' Rebecca Kaplan if he was referring to President Trump, Reed replied, ""I was talking about the budget legislation."" He did not elaborate. CBS News reached out to Reed's office for more clarification, which responded, ""They are talking about budget demands.""

The hot mic recording continued with Collins' reply: ""I'm worried,"" she says.

""Oof,"" Reed sighs. ""You know, this thing — if we don't get a budget deal, we're going to be paralyzed.""

""I know,"" Collins said.

""[Department of Defense] is going to be paralyzed, everybody is going to be paralyzed,"" Reed replies.

""I don't think he knows there is a [Budget Control Act] or anything,"" Collins said in reference to a law outlining the budget process.

If Democrats and Republicans cannot reach a budget agreement, as Collins mentioned, there will be across-the-board cuts to discretionary spending, because of the Budget Control Act, passed in 2011. And that agreement requires 60 votes.

""He was down at the Ford commissioning,"" Reed says, apparently talking about Mr. Trump's recent announcement regarding a Navy aircraft carrier, ""saying, 'I want them to pass my budget.' Okay, so we give him $54 billion and then we take it away across the board which would cause chaos.""

""Right,"" Collins said.

""It's just — and he hasn't — not one word about the budget. Not one word about the debt ceiling,"" Reed said.

""Good point,"" Collins replies. The debt ceiling must be raised likely by mid-October or the U.S. risks defaulting on its debt.

""You've got [Budget Director Mick] Mulvaney saying we're going to put in all sorts of stuff like a border wall. Then you've got [Treasury Secretary Steve] Mnuchin saying it's got to be clean,"" Reed continues. ""We're going to be back in September, and, you know, you're going to have crazy people in the House.""

Following this point in the conversation between the two senators, they began discussing Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas. Recently, Farenthold said in a radio interview that if Collins were not a female, he could challenge her to a ""duel,"" citing frustration with Collins' opposition to the Senate health care bill aimed at repealing Obamacare.

""Did you see the one who challenged me to a duel?"" Collins asked Reed.

""I know, trust me, do you know why he challenged you to a duel? 'Cause you could beat the s**t out of him,"" Reed joked.

""Well, he's huge and he — I don't mean to be unkind, but he's so unattractive it's unbelievable,"" Collins said of Farenthold. ""Did you see the picture of him in his pajamas next to this Playboy bunny?"" she continued, referencing a photo of Farenthold wearing a matching pajama set with rubber ducks while standing next to a scantily-clad young woman.

The recording of the conversation between the two senators conversation ended after this comment."

227,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/matthew-mcconaughey-and-bryce-dallas-howard-on-why-they-loved-their-characters-in-gold/,cbsnews,"Matthew McConaughey and Bryce Dallas Howard on why they loved their characters in ""Gold""",['Andrea Park'],"New movie “Gold” takes on the true story of the 1993 Bre-X mining scandal, when prospectors supposedly found an enormous gold deposit in Indonesia.

Stars Matthew McConaughey, who plays rags-to-riches businessman Kenny Wells, and Bryce Dallas Howard, who plays Kenny’s girlfriend Kay, talked to CBS News about what got them excited for their roles when they read the script.

McConaughey said he was attracted to Wells’ scrappiness.

In the film, Wells is a bald and paunchy down-on-his-luck businessman who has a dream about finding gold. The prospector is determined to make good on his dream and dig for gold with his partner, geologist Michael Acosta, in Indonesia and comes up against a few big-time Wall Street investors along the way.

“This guy, Kenny Wells, is chasing down this dream that he literally had -- chasing down a literal dream that he had -- believing in it it all the way to the death. He would die for this dream. And that’s how he lives. He would cheat death to achieve this dream,” said McConaughey. “What a pure spirit, too -- a guy who has no trouble turning down $300 million to buy out his company but yet can barely speak and is sweating when he’s going to receive Prospector of the Year award in front of his friends in Reno, Nevada. That’s a pure soul.”

McConaughey added that he can relate to Wells in that he never allows himself to rest on his laurels: “On a daily basis, I know I’ve got work to do. I know I’ve got places where I can improve.”

In contrast, Howard said what attracted her most to the role of Kay was her satisfaction with her life. In the film, Kay, who has stayed with Wells through all of his low points, proves to be far tougher than she appears.

“I loved that we weren’t seeing a woman who’s dissatisfied,” said Howard. “We’re seeing a woman who’s fulfilled in her life and it’s Kenny, really, who’s figuring things out.”

México se ha convertido en refugio de venezolanos. Durante los primeros cinco meses del 2017, ingresaron a 33 mil 985 habitantes de esa nación a territorio azteca. Así lo revela Unidad de Políticas Migratorias de la Secretaría de Gobernación.

Esto significa que todos los días entran a nuestra nación 226 venezolanos.

Orillados por la crisis que vive su país, miles decidieron quedarse en México, ya sea como ilegales, refugiados o residentes temporales.

José Arévalo es uno de ellos. Al llegar a la Ciudad de México halló un empleo informal como repartidor de alimentos, pero después acudió a la Comisión Mexicana de Ayuda a Refugiados (COMAR) y ya recibió oficialmente asilo político.

Cuenta a Uno TV que el documento que le fue entregado ""te da un salvoconducto de estadía legal dentro del territorio mexicano, con permiso de trabajo y CURP"".

La estrategia legal utilizada por José se disparó recientemente. Durante el primer semestre de 2017 se triplicó el número de solicitudes de refugio.

En el año 2015, la comisión recibió apenas 57 solicitudes de venezolanos. En el 2016 fueron 361, pero en lo que va de 2017, ha recibido mil 420 peticiones. Hasta ahora ha otorgado 674 permisos humanitarios.

En lo que va de este año, otros 2 mil 333 han optado por pedir tarjetas de residencia temporal ante el Instituto Nacional de Migración.

El perfil de quienes huyen de la crisis venezolana es variado. Por ejemplo, María Pura Imhof es historiadora. Llegó a México hace algunos meses y aquí trabaja en campañas publicitarias. Cuenta a UnoTV que a los mexicanos les causa curiosidad el método de gobierno de Nicolás Maduro.

Cuando le consultan respecto a temas políticos de Venezuela, su advertencia es muy clara: ""Pero lo que sí les puedo decir a los mexicanos y a las mexicanas es que lean y se informen y que no se dejen enamorar por la poesía política de un líder populista"".

Los refugiados en México, por ahora, descartan regresar a su país; en donde la crisis se agudiza día a día.

232,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/they-kept-us-as-slaves-ap-report-reveals-claims-against-church/,cbsnews,"""They kept us as slaves"": AP report reveals claims against church",['Crimesider Staff'],"SPINDALE, N.C. -- When Andre Oliveira answered the call to leave his Word of Faith Fellowship congregation in Brazil to move to the mother church in North Carolina at the age of 18, his passport and money were confiscated by church leaders -- for safekeeping, he said he was told.

Trapped in a foreign land, he said he was forced to work 15 hours a day, usually for no pay, first cleaning warehouses for the secretive evangelical church and later toiling at businesses owned by senior ministers. Any deviation from the rules risked the wrath of church leaders, he said, ranging from beatings to shaming from the pulpit.

""They trafficked us up here. They knew what they were doing. They needed labor and we were cheap labor -- hell, free labor,"" Oliveira said.

An Associated Press investigation has found that Word of Faith Fellowship used its two church branches in Latin America's largest nation to siphon a steady flow of young laborers who came on tourist and student visas to its 35-acre compound in rural Spindale.

Under U.S. law, visitors on tourist visas are prohibited from performing work for which people normally would be compensated. Those on student visas are allowed some work, under circumstances that were not met at Word of Faith Fellowship, the AP found.

On at least one occasion, former members alerted authorities. In 2014, three ex-congregants told an assistant U.S. attorney that the Brazilians were being forced to work for no pay, according to a recording obtained by the AP.

""And do they beat up the Brazilians?"" Jill Rose, now the U.S. attorney in Charlotte, asked.

""Most definitely,"" one of the former congregants responded. Ministers ""mostly bring them up here for free work,"" another said.

Though Rose could be heard promising to look into it, the former members said she never responded when they repeatedly tried to contact her in the months after the meeting.

Rose declined to comment to the AP, citing an ongoing investigation.

Oliveira, who fled the church last year, is one of 16 Brazilian former members who told the AP they were forced to work, often for no pay, and physically or verbally assaulted. The AP also reviewed scores of police reports and formal complaints lodged in Brazil about the church's harsh conditions.

""They kept us as slaves,"" Oliveira said, pausing at times to wipe away tears. ""We were expendable. We meant nothing to them. Nothing. How can you do that to people -- claim you love them and then beat them in the name of God?""

The Brazilians often spoke little English when they arrived, and many had their passports seized.

Many males worked in construction; many females worked as babysitters and in the church's K-12 school, the former members said. One ex-congregant from Brazil told AP she was only 12 the first time she was put to work.

Although immigration officials in both countries said it was impossible to calculate the volume of the human pipeline, at least several hundred young Brazilians have migrated to North Carolina over the past two decades, based on interviews with former members.

The revelations of forced labor are the latest in an ongoing AP investigation exposing years of abuse at Word of Faith Fellowship. Based on exclusive interviews with 43 former members, documents and secretly made recordings, the AP reported in February that congregants were regularly punched, smacked and choked in an effort to ""purify"" sinners by beating out devils.

The church has rarely been sanctioned since it was founded in 1979 by sect leader Jane Whaley, a former math teacher, and her husband, Sam. Another previous AP report outlined how congregants were ordered by church leaders to lie to authorities investigating reports of abuse.

The AP made repeated attempts to obtain comments for this story from church leaders in both countries, but they did not respond.

Under Jane Whaley's leadership, Word of Faith Fellowship grew from a handful of followers to about 750 congregants in North Carolina and a total of nearly 2,000 members in its churches in Brazil and Ghana and its affiliations in Sweden, Scotland and other countries.

Members visit the Spindale compound from around the world, but Brazil is the biggest source of foreign labor and Whaley and her top lieutenants visit the Brazilian outposts several times a year, the AP found.

Former member Thiago Silva said he was excited when he boarded a plane in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte to fly to a Word of Faith youth seminar in North Carolina in 2001. He was 18 and expecting to use his tourist visa to meet new people and visit the U.S.

He soon learned, he said, that there would be ""no happiness.""

""Brazilians came here for labor. I'm telling you, that's it,"" Silva said. He called the treatment ""a violation of human rights.""

Silva, now 34, recounted being among a group of Brazilians working alongside Americans -- the locals were paid, the Brazilians were not, he said.

Silva and others also said Whaley took complete control of congregants' lives on both continents, mandating such daily staples of life as where they lived and when they could eat -- and even forcing some into arranged marriages to Americans so they could stay in the country.

The lack of freedom was pervasive, they said: Silva, for example, said he could phone his parents from the U.S only if someone who spoke Portuguese monitored the call.

""There's no free will,"" he said. ""There's Jane's will.""

""I suffered so much there""

Over the course of two decades, Word of Faith Fellowship absorbed two churches in Brazil, in the southeastern cities of Sao Joaquim de Bicas and Franco da Rocha.

During her frequent visits, Whaley would tell the Brazilian members of her flock that they could improve both their lives and their relationships with God with a pilgrimage to the mother church, according to several of those interviewed. The Brazilians' brand of worship was inferior, she often would say.

In addition to being promised a higher standing in the church, some said they also were enticed with the chance to attend college, to learn English, to see a bit of the U.S.

Others said they felt they simply had no choice.

All the while, the strict rules in place in Spindale were being imposed in Brazil, leading to complaints to police reviewed by the AP and a legislative hearing in 2009. But Word of Faith never faced any official censure -- many of the allegations came down to the word of ex-members against the church -- and the human pipeline continued to flow, even as Brazilian parents said they were being completely cut off from their children in North Carolina.

Labeled a ""rebel"" because she talked back to pastors as a child, Elizabeth Oliveira, who is no relation to Andre, told the AP that she was frequently kept in isolation for days at a time in various ministers' homes in Sao Joaquim de Bicas.

Being sent to the U.S. was a way to ""correct"" her bad behavior. She said she was 12 when she made her first extended trip to Spindale and was immediately put to work. She helped out in the school during the day, then sewed clothes and babysat in the evenings, sometimes well past midnight, Oliveira said. She was never paid, she said.

Now 21 and studying medicine in Belo Horizonte, Oliveira said she broke with the church after her eighth trip to Spindale.

""I suffered so much there,"" she said. ""When I turned 18, I left and was told, once again, that I would die on my own in the world and go to hell.""

Ana Albuquerque traveled to Spindale from Brazil 11 times over the course of more than a decade, starting at age 5 with her parents. Over time, she said she witnessed so much screaming and shoving to ""expunge devils"" that she began to see the behavior as normal.

In her final three trips, she joined a group of two dozen other Brazilian teens staying up to six months under tourist visas.

""They come to you and say, 'You will get to know the United States of America. You will get to go to the malls,'"" she said. ""But when you get there, everything is controlled.""

Albuquerque, now 25, said she worked full time without pay -- as a teacher's aide at the school during the day and then babysitting congregants' children at night.

Her reckoning came during her final trip, when she was 16. Albuquerque said Whaley and another minister repeatedly spanked her with a flat piece of wood while screaming that she was ""unclean"" and possessed by the devil.

""Pray for it to come out of you!"" Albuquerque recalled being exhorted during a session lasting 40 minutes.

During her final two weeks in Spindale, Albuquerque said she endured days of forced isolation, Bible reading, threats of being placed in a psychiatric ward and refusals by Whaley to let her call her parents. She finally was allowed to return to Brazil, where she left the church.

Luiz Pires said he was 18 in 2006 when he was encouraged by ministers in the Sao Joaquim de Bicas church to travel to North Carolina for his spiritual betterment.

Upon arrival, he said he found ""horrific"" living conditions, with eight people crammed in the basement of a church leader's house, forced to work long hours at church-related businesses. Any payment went to living expenses, Pires said, despite the fact that he and others cleaned and did yard work at the member's house where they lived.

""There was never time to sit down. We were worked like slaves,"" he said.

Former congregant Jay Plummer supervised remodeling projects for a church leader's business and confirmed that his fellow American workers were paid while the Brazilians who labored alongside them were not.

""Room and board is what they worked for, and they did not have a choice,"" Plummer told the AP. ""And when they would not want to work and vocalize that, they would just get in trouble.""

Paulo Henrique Barbosa had heard the horror stories about life in Spindale. But the sect's influence was so great that he said he felt he must comply when church leaders in Franco da Rocha -- supported by his parents -- told him to travel to Spindale in 2011, when he was 17.

Pastors told him he would violate God's will if he refused.

""Everybody knew these trips were not about tourism,"" said Barbosa, now 23 and working in information technology in Sao Paolo. ""I didn't want to go, but I had no choice.""

Once in Spindale, conditions were worse than he feared, he said: For six months, he helped in the school in the mornings and worked in construction in the afternoons and evenings, sometimes until 1 a.m. He was never paid, he said.

The church controlled everything he did, Barbosa said, even prohibiting snacks between meals. Television, music and certain brand-name products all were off-limits.

Barbosa said he also slept in a church member's basement, with about 15 other young males. Speaking Portuguese was forbidden.

Anyone in the bathroom for more than the mandated five minutes was suspected of committing the ""sin"" of masturbation, and Whaley would be called to the house to decree the punishment.

If any of the males appeared to be having an ""impure dream,"" Barbosa said, everybody would be awakened, ordered to surround him and repeatedly shake him and shriek into his ears to ""expulse the devils,"" a Word of Faith practice called ""blasting.""

Barbosa said he asked to return to Brazil many times ""but they always told me no, that it was God's will for me to stay.""

Leaving on his own seemed insurmountable, Barbosa said. He had flown into Charlotte, more than an hour from Spindale, and had no car and little money. He knew no one outside the church and did not speak English. He was allowed to return to Brazil only when his six-month tourist visa was set to expire.

""From the time you are a kid, you are trained to believe that leaving the church will mean you go to hell, get cancer or get AIDS,"" he said.

Visa violations

The AP investigation documented repeated abuses of the tourist and student visas obtained for Brazilian church members.

Brazilians most often first arrived in North Carolina on six-month tourist visas for church functions, sometimes 20 or 30 at a time. Some Brazilians would leave after a few weeks; others would stay the duration.

Perhaps to circumvent the rules against employment, church leaders sometimes referred to the forced labor projects as ""volunteer work,"" according to Brazilians interviewed in both countries.

Such work included ripping out walls and installing drywall in apartments owned and rented out by a senior church minister and family members, they said.

Ross Eisenbrey of the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank focusing on labor issues, said rental properties are ""for-profit businesses for which the immigrants cannot volunteer"" under the Fair Labor Standards Act.

Some of those interviewed said they'd been lured to the U.S. in part by promises of obtaining a college education but were unable to study or attend classes because of their punishing work schedules.

""There were times I would get done at 4 in the morning and I knew I had to get up by 8 to go to work. I would sit there, staring at my books. But how can you concentrate? You're just too tired,"" Andre Oliveira said.

Former congregants said far more Brazilians came on tourist visas, with several hundred teenagers staying for extended periods.

The experience of Andre Oliveira, now 24, is illustrative.

After first traveling to Spindale in 2009, he said it took him months to obtain permission to return to Brazil. Back home, he said he and others were forced to move into a minister's house, where he worked as a cleaner for months until he was told ""it was the will of God to visit Spindale -- this time, on a student visa.""

When he arrived back in North Carolina, ministers again took his passport and put him to work in companies owned by church ministers, he said. He took a few college classes, but didn't have time to study.

""A typical day would start like this: I'd start work at 9 in the morning and it would end 15 or 16 hours later -- sometimes longer,"" he said. ""We didn't stop.""

Oliveira and others said they had little choice but to follow orders.

""We knew what would happen: We would be screamed at, blasted, hit. And what are you going to do? You have nowhere to go. You don't know the language. You have no documentation. So you work,"" Oliveira said.

""It was slave labor,"" added Rebeca Melo, 29, who grew up in the church in Brazil and visited the U.S. about 10 times for religious functions and trips with her family.

Those visits included shopping excursions, but she said things were far different when she moved to Spindale on a student visa in 2009.

""I did not want to move here. Jane said it was the will of God,"" she told the AP.

Melo said her passport was taken and she was quickly put to work. Despite her student visa, church officials were clear that school was not to be her focus, she said.

Student visas were just a ""means for us to be here legally,"" she said.

Arranged marriages

Whaley's brand of ""love"" also played a key role in enticing Brazilian males to Spindale -- and keeping them there once their visas expired, according to 10 former members of the church.

Some of those interviewed spoke of male Brazilians -- as well as church members from various other countries -- obtaining green cards for permanent residency and being able to legally work by being ""married off"" to female American congregants.

It is illegal to enter a sham marriage for the purpose of avoiding U.S. immigration laws.

The arranged marriages also addressed the fact that the Spindale congregation has more unmarried females than males, the ex-members said. Under Whaley's rules, congregants aren't allowed to date outside the church, much less marry.

""I can count at least five or six Brazilian guys that moved here to marry an American girl,"" Melo said. ""They would never, ever, ever consider letting you date somebody outside of the church.""

Silva said that Whaley often told people that she heard from God who they should marry or used her iron grip over members' lives to arrange relationships.

Silva recalled a young Brazilian couple in love who would be unable to stay in the U.S. past their visas if they married. Whaley wanted to keep the man in Spindale so she told him it was the ""will of God"" for him to marry an American, Silva said.

With his visa time running down, Andre Oliveira said church leaders found him a bride.

It wasn't long after former member Kim Rooper joined the Spindale church that she said she was asked to marry a man from Ecuador whose visa was expiring.

Rooper, an American who now lives in Tampa, Florida, said she was coached on how to make the marriage look legitimate to immigration authorities, like keeping a photo album of the couple.

""Long story short, it came time to consummate the marriage and I struggled with that,"" she said. ""I had a hard time because I didn't love him, and nor did I have an attraction to him.""

Church leaders told her it was the ""will of God"" to submit to her husband, Rooper said.

""And that's when I knew I had to escape,"" she said.

John Lewis, Comic-Con had something for almost every pop-culture appetite.

As the annual fan convention in San Diego wraps Sunday after four days of panels, presentations, screenings and autograph signings, here's a look at some of the highlights.

Black Panther

The film won't be out until February 2018, but ""Black Panther"" swiped the most attention at Marvel's presentation. Director Ryan Coogler and cast members Chadwick Boseman, Lupita Nyong'o, Andy Serkis and Danai Gurira were on hand to debut a clip from the film.

Boseman, who introduced his Black Panther character in 2016's ""Captain America: Civil War,"" said the new film finds him returning to his home of Wakanda after his father dies. Nyong'o described her character as a spy who goes undercover to report back to the fictional isolated nation about what is going on in the rest of the world.

Marvel's presentation also included early looks at the November release ""Thor: Ragnarok"" and next year's ""Avengers: Infinity War."" And studio chief Kevin Feige announced that Michelle Pfeiffer was cast in the ""Ant-Man"" sequel ""Ant-Man and the Wasp,"" also due in 2018.

Wonder Woman ... part deux

As of Sunday, the superhero pic is now the highest-grossing film of the summer with $398 million from North American theaters, and the sequel is official. Warner Bros. is not saying much about the inevitable follow-up to the smash hit, but the studio did flash a title card with the words ""Wonder Woman II"" during its Comic-Con presentation Saturday.

But that was the extent of the ""Wonder Woman II"" talk at the fan convention. There is no official word on whether or not Patty Jenkins will return to direct, who is penning the script or even when the film might hit theaters.

Not even Gal Gadot mentioned it during the Comic-Con ""Justice League"" panel.

Batman

There was a lot of Batman at Comic-Con, from Ben Affleck's confirmation that he'll continue to play the character to a star-filled tribute to the original ""Batman"" actor, Adam West.

Affleck refuted rumors that he would no longer play the character after ceding direction of ""The Batman"" to ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" director Matt Reeves. The actor also appeared alongside some of his ""Justice League"" costars, including Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman), Jason Momoa (Aquaman), Ezra Miller (The Flash) and Ray Fisher (Cyborg) as they showed footage from the film due in November.

West was celebrated by his fans and collaborators at a heartfelt tribute that featured Kevin Smith, producer James Tucker, actor Ralph Garman and ""Catwoman"" actress Lee Meriwether. Smith said he learned morality from West's portrayal of Batman in the original TV series, and Meriwether said she was so dazzled by the actor during the making of ""Batman: The Movie"" that she nearly lost track of her performance - especially during a ballroom scene where they danced together.

""All I could think of was, 'I'm dancing with Adam West,' "" she said. ""I probably blew one take and then I snapped out of it.""

Stranger Things

The popular Netflix show took over the San Diego Convention Center's largest exhibition hall to debut a new trailer for its anticipated second season. The show, set in the early 1980s, follows a group of kids trying to figure out how their friend mysteriously disappeared. Along the way, they meet an unusual girl named Eleven, who has telepathic powers.

Show creators the Duffer Bros. were joined by director Shawn Levy and star Millie Bobby Brown (Eleven) and the other young actors in the ensemble: Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin and Noah Schnapp.

""Stranger Things"" also had a presence in downtown San Diego with an installation that resembled the show's set and a virtual-reality experience that brought guests into the home of the missing boy and face to face with the monster that haunts him.

Blade Runner 2049

Harrison Ford joked that he was out to reboot all of his iconic roles. The actor was on hand to present footage from ""Blade Runner 2049,"" in which he reprises his role as Rick Deckard. Ford said he gained a deeper understanding of his character in the sequel, which hits theaters in October.

Ford appeared alongside costar Ryan Gosling at the film's panel.

""Blade Runner 2049"" also hosted a massive installation away from the San Diego Convention Center where fans could experience the Los Angeles of the future through virtual reality and replication of key sets inhabited by actors wearing actual costumes from the film.

Ready Player One

Steven Spielberg has spent more than two years adapting Ernest Cline's novel ""Ready Player One"" for the screen, and the filmmaker said he was proud to debut a new trailer inside Comic-Con's biggest exhibition hall.

Actor Tye Sheridan stars in the story about a dystopian future where humans take refuge in a virtual-reality world.

For Cline, having Spielberg make a movie based on his book is a full-circle moment. ""I learned how to be a storyteller because of this man,"" the author said.

Rep. John Lewis

Civil rights icon U.S. Rep. John Lewis led about 1,000 people on a march through the crowded San Diego Convention Center following a discussion of his trilogy of graphic novels about his participation in nonviolent protests during the civil rights movement in the 1950s and '60s.

Lewis urged the many students in attendance to recognize that they, too, can make a contribution toward a better world. He said the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., inspired him to ""get in trouble - what I call good trouble, necessary trouble.""

""Now more than ever before, we all need to get in trouble,"" he said. ""When you see something that is not right, not fair, not just, you have a moral obligation, a mission and a mandate to stand up, to speak up, to speak out and get in trouble.""

Editor's Note: An earlier version of this Associated Press report incorrectly stated the release year for ""Black Panther."" This story is now corrected to state that the movie will be released in 2018."
236,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sixth-mass-extinction-biological-annihilation/,cbsnews,"Earth faces ""biological annihilation"" in sixth mass extinction, scientists warn",['Shanika Gunaratna'],"Over the last half-billion years, scientists say there have been five mass extinction events on Earth in which a wide diversity of species on this planet suddenly died off. Now, there's growing evidence that a sixth mass extinction is unfolding, according to scientists who track species around the globe. In a new study, researchers say the current mass extinction is even ""more severe than perceived"" and amounts to ""biological annihilation"" affecting thousands of species.

In the study, published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers from Stanford University and the National Autonomous University of Mexico unveiled a granular look at population trends among 27,600 species of birds, amphibians, mammals, and reptiles — half of the world's known terrestrial vertebrates — including detailed analysis of 177 species of mammals.

The results are grim: researchers found an ""extremely high degree of population decay"" among vertebrates, even in species considered at low risk of extinction. In general, they found that the world's temperate regions are losing species at equal or even higher rates than the tropics.

""Earth is experiencing a huge episode of population declines and extirpations"" — when a species ceases to exist in a particular location — ""which will have negative cascading consequences on ecosystem functioning and services vital to sustaining civilization,"" the researchers wrote.

""We describe this as a 'biological annihilation' to highlight the current magnitude of Earth's ongoing sixth major extinction event.""

Pushed to the brink

Dividing the world's land masses into a grid of 22,000 sections measuring 10,000-square-kilometers (about 3,860 square miles) each, the researchers tracked species declines and painted a stark picture of populations being pushed to their limits.

For instance: lions have historically occupied roughly 2,000 of the 10,000-square-kilometer cells across several continents, but now occupy little more than 600 cells in sub-Saharan Africa and India. In south and southeast Asia, all the large-bodied mammals analyzed have lost more than 80 percent of their geographic ranges.

Looking through the lens of local populations extinctions (the precursor to irreversible species extinctions), the researchers conclude that ""Earth's sixth mass extinction episode has proceeded further than most assume.""

Senior conservation scientist Robin Naidoo of the World Wildlife Fund said the study ""makes a point that's sometimes missed"" by concentrating on the long, complex path that precedes species extinction, from declining populations to decreasing range. Even if it's far from extinction, a species in decline can cause ""cascading effects on vegetation and habitat"" in ecological networks that depend on balance between animals, plants and microorganisms, Naidoo told CBS News.

Conservation groups like the International Union for Conservation of Nature categorize species across the spectrum of extinction risk, from ""least concern,"" to ""near threatened,"" ""vulnerable,"" ""endangered,"" ""critically endangered,"" ""extinct in the wild,"" and eventually ""extinct.""

""This paper makes the point that it's not just about extinction — it's about declines in populations. A species doesn't have to go extinct for a variety of negative effects to be felt,"" Naidoo said.

These negative effects can directly impact humans in many ways. In fishing communities, fish so scarce they're considered ""commercially extinct"" can destroy local economies. In Africa, elephant declines due to poaching cost local economies $25 million per year in lost tourism revenue, according to a recent study from the World Wildlife Fund.

Humans are to blame

Earth's previous mass extinctions were often associated with sudden, cataclysmic natural events: abrupt changes in climate, massive volcanic eruptions, giant meteor strikes (like the one that wiped out the dinosaurs approximately 66 million years ago).

The current mass extinction stands apart because it's largely caused by humans, researchers say. From pollution to deforestation, overpopulation, poaching, warming oceans, and extreme weather events tied to global warming, human activity is the primary fuel behind this new era of irreversible species loss.

Humans are leaving the world ""a much, much poorer place,"" Elizabeth Kolbert, author of ""The Sixth Extinction"" and a staff writer for the New Yorker, told CBS News. In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book, Kolbert argues that depleting the planet's biodiversity looks likely to be humankind's most lasting legacy.

Though periodic extinctions have long played a role in life on Earth, the current scope and rate of extinctions is anything but normal. The Earth has lost 200 species of vertebrates in the past 100 years alone, the researchers behind the new study noted. If the trends of the past two million years had held up, those losses should have unfolded gradually over 10,000 years rather than a single century.

""An extinction should be something that's very unusual,"" Kolbert said. ""When you can identify lots of species that have gone extinct or are on the verge of extinction, that's actually a very unusual time in the Earth's history and a very dangerous one.""

This steady stream of species loss, about two extinctions per year, hardly makes a blip on the public's radar. In many cases, that's because the losses are obscure: recent extinctions include Mexico's Catarina pupfish or the Christmas Island pipistrelle bat, hardly household names.

Stories about these individual extinctions often fail to convey the magnitude and urgency of the larger context: that for only the sixth time in history of the planet, the Earth's biodiversity appears to be coming apart at the seams.

""I really do think — and this study underscores that — that this is the big issue of our time,"" Kolbert said. ""I mean literally right now and for the next many, many centuries, decades, perhaps millennia."""

238,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/financial-game-changers-budgeting-pregnancy-or-a-job-loss/,cbsnews,Financial game-changers: Budgeting for the unexpected,['Jillian Harding'],"Life can upend even the most carefully crafted financial plans. A surprise pregnancy or unexpected job loss, for instance, could mean putting retirement goals on hold to account for changing circumstance and priorities.

When you get thrown a curve ball, here are a few things to keep in mind to keep your retirement plan on track:

Expect the unexpected

Most financial experts recommend keeping an emergency fund that covers three to six months of expenses. Make that a full year's worth of expenses if you are self-employed or your income is prone to fluctuate.

Concerned because you don't have an emergency fund? You aren't alone: 69 percent Americans have less than $1,000 saved for a rainy day, according to a GoBankingRates survey. That's a risky place to be -- one wrong move and you could be backed into a corner with nowhere to go but a high-interest personal loan or credit card. Make a plan: There are many savings accounts with low minimum balance requirements that can help you start socking away some cash. Although the yield on many of these accounts may be low, over time that money adds up as interest is earned.

""We can all get through a major event, and we can thank the credit card industry for that,"" financial adviser Devon Klumb told CBS MoneyWatch. ""But many people do not do a good job of paying the card right away -- and if you tack 17 to 25 percent interest on a credit card [balance], people get into trouble.""

Baby on the way

Having a baby is a huge physical, emotional -- and financial -- event. The first year of a child's life, including daycare, can cost a middle-class family up to $21,000.

What can you do to minimize those costs while making the right long-term decisions for your growing family?

Do as much as you can to prepare ahead of time. Within a general timeframe of nine months, you have time to research changes to health insurance and daycare costs; also do the math on the price of daily essentials, and reach out to your support network.

There are lots of ways to cut costs. Julia Wang, digital content head at the maternity website The Bump, said people tend to overspend on items such as clothing, toys and fancy crib bedding -- much of which will be used for a very short period of time, if at all.

""Clothes have such a low return on investment -- babies grow so quickly, you'll never recoup the cost of the clothing. If you can get a hand-me-down, take advantage of it,"" she said.

Instead, purchase big-ticket items ahead of time and stock up on essentials like diapers or wipes. Start paying attention to costs of diapers and formula -- buy them now, before the baby comes, and have family and friends be on the lookout for bargains.

Another important thing to consider: maternity and paternity leave, and childcare. See if you qualify for the Family Medical Leave Act and make sure you understand your employer's maternity and paternity leave policies. Depending on your state of residence, you may have more generous leave policies, in addition to support like nursing coaches or other assistance once your child is born.

Who will care for your child on a daily basis, and what that will do to your budget? More than a third of U.S. families spend 20 percent or more of their annual income on childcare, according to a Care.com parent survey. Deciding whether outside care is right for you means carefully considering your options.

""Some people decide that mom (or dad) is done working,"" financial adviser Matthew Seppanen said. ""It's shocking how easy it is to prioritize spending when you are bringing someone into the world. Everything goes out the window.""

Especially for the first year, when a new budget is being implemented, it's okay to take a breather from retirement contributions -- as long as you factor in the changes and begin contributing again as soon as possible.

Out of a job

In the event of a sudden job loss, the most important thing to do is prioritize necessary spending. Focus on keeping the lights on, paying rent, paying your health insurance bills and getting your next job. Make sure you account for any severance your ex-employer might owe you and file for unemployment benefits if you are eligible.

It's OK if your retirement contributions are put on hold during this time period. Most experts say you should even wait to decide what to do with any existing retirement funds until you move to your next job.

""It's such a traumatic event,"" financial adviser Sanjay Jain said. ""Once you settle in your next job, then you can take care of it.""

While you may be tempted to immediately roll over any existing retirement funds into an IRA plan, many experts suggest waiting until you know where you will land. If you have a 401(k) at your former employer, your next company may use the same provider, allowing you to easily move that money over to the new plan. Immediately transferring the money to an IRA when you lose a job means you won't be able to consolidate your savings, if it's allowed at your new job.

Keeping your health insurance while unemployed is another essential. If you lose your employer-sponsored coverage, you may qualify to continue benefits with COBRA, including in cases of voluntary or involuntary job loss, a drop in work hours, and other life events. This will generally allow you to keep your current health insurance for up to a year, though you will need to pay the full premium each month. Although the monthly costs of carrying COBRA can be high, the financial risks of being uninsured are arguably higher.

""You don't want to go through a catastrophic event while you are unemployed,"" Jain said.

There is a 60-day period after you lose employer sponsored health care coverage to enroll in COBRA, which you can use to determine whether this is the best coverage option.

You could also buy an individual insurance plan under the Affordable Care Act. A job loss is a qualifying event, allowing you to purchase a policy at any time, and if your income drops you could qualify for a subsidy. (President Trump has made it his goal to repeal the law, but until then it is in effect.) If your income drops significantly, you might even be eligible for Medicaid.

Don't panic

Most important, don't panic. Examine your budget: Where can you cut back on spending? Is there a way to add income, even if it's a short-term ""side hustle""? Although your financial goals may take longer to reach, often there are ways to supplement savings and rebuild your finances.

""Overall, it is best to run several scenarios and see if it is possible to 'give a little' from several corners of your financial life – a little from the monthly budget, a slightly cheaper vacation this year, a little less in education savings, a slightly reduced contribution to retirement account, etc,"" financial adviser David Metzger told CBS MoneyWatch. ""It definitely doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing proposition. Then when the reality of the new life event has settled in, we can begin making adjustment back in the direction from which we came."""

""There is no doubt that this case is distasteful; it may be worse than that,"" wrote Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. in the majority opinion. ""But our concern is not with tawdry tales of Ferraris, Rolexes, and ball gowns. It is instead with the broader legal implications of the government's boundless interpretation of the federal bribery statute.""

CBS News

This week on 60 Minutes, correspondent Bill Whitaker reports on that ""tawdry tale,"" in which McDonnell and his wife accepted $177,000 from a local businessman in personal loans and expensive gifts. That businessman, Jonnie Williams, testified under immunity for the prosecution that he was entirely sure he and the governor had an agreement: money and gifts for political favors.

According to the 60 Minutes report, Williams wanted the governor's help getting state-sponsored studies of his tobacco-based supplement called Anatabloc, which he claimed had healing powers. To curry favor, Williams doled out cash and gifts to the Governor and his wife. There was a $6,500 Rolex watch and a $15,000 check for catering the wedding of the McDonnells' daughter. He also treated McDonnell's wife, Maureen, to a New York City shopping spree to the tune of $20,000.

Neither Jonnie Williams nor Maureen McDonnell agreed to speak with 60 Minutes. So why did Bob McDonnell?

Whitaker discusses that question in this week's 60 Minutes Overtime interview, posted in the video player above.

""I think it was because when he left the public eye, it was under a cloud of scandal,"" says Whitaker. ""And since then, his conviction was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court. I think he wants that part of the narrative to get out there.""

McDonnell's decision to talk also raises a question about his future. Was the interview part of a political comeback plan? Whitaker did ask McDonnell if he feels the pull to get back into politics, and he replied, ""I think politically probably the ship has sailed.""

Then he added: ""Never say never.""

If viewers of the 60 Minutes story wanted to hear deep remorse from McDonnell for accepting the largesse of a constituent, they came up empty. McDonnell repeatedly reminded Whitaker that he had been complying with Virginia laws -- which have since changed -- when he took the cash and gifts.

He may not have broken the law -- but did he do the right thing? ""That's the question we kept asking him,"" says Whitaker. ""It may not have been illegal, but was it right?""

""I think it's one of those things that we, the American voter, has to look at and say, are we okay with that?"" Whitaker says. ""And if we're not, what are we going to do about it?""

The chain disclosed Wednesday it received the subpoena July 19 for information tied to what health officials believe was a norovirus outbreak at its Sterling, Virginia, location.

Chipotle (CMG) noted it received a subpoena last year in connection with a criminal investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California and the Food and Drug Administration. That subpoena required documents tied to a California restaurant where a norovirus outbreak occurred in 2015. Chipotle was subpoenaed after the chain was hit with an E. coli outbreak and a separate norovirus outbreak later that year.

The company said that it doesn't know whether it would incur fines or penalties tied to the investigation.

The Loudoun County Health Department in Virginia said Monday that a second person has tested positive for norovirus, and that the strain was the same strain as in the first person who tested positive. The department says it identified more than 135 people who reported becoming ill after visiting the Chipotle in Sterling between July 13 and 16.

The health department said, however, that it has not identified the specific source of the norovirus. It says it is not aware of any customers becoming ill since the store in Sterling reopened last Wednesday, after undergoing what the restaurant chain called ""complete sanitizations.""

Denver-based Chipotle said that norovirus does not come from its food supply and that it is safe to eat at its restaurants.

Chipotle has been working to bounce back from a series of food scares that started with an E. coli outbreak in the fall of 2015 and included a norovirus case in Boston. More than 100 patrons of the restaurant, including dozens of Boston College student, fell ill with the gastrointestinal illness. The company also was forced to temporarily shut down at least 43 restaurants in Oregon and Washington because of reported E. coli cases.

Novovirus, the most common cause of foodborne illness in the U.S., causes nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, but with proper treatment most patients recover within a few days. A sick employee is believed to have been the source of the outbreak at the Boston Chipotle location.

Chipotle's financial performance was badly damaged by the food scares, as both its sales and stock price slumped."

AP

In the wake of last fall's elections, we've heard lots of talk of draining the swamp, of corruption and influence peddling, but amid all the heated discourse, you might have missed an important political story that is reverberating across the country and that we first reported in April.

""I listened to 19 guilty verdicts for my wife and me. And all I could do was sob."" Bob McDonnell

It's the case of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell, who was an up-and-coming Republican star with a squeaky clean image and a record of promoting job growth. But his political career exploded in scandal worthy of a soap opera when he was convicted of public corruption and sentenced to two years in federal prison. He fought the charges all the way to the United States Supreme Court -- wracking up a hefty legal bill of $27 million. It turned out to be worth it. The Supreme Court reversed his conviction in a controversial and far-reaching ruling – but not without a hitch. Chief Justice John Roberts described the case as ""tawdry tales.""

Tonight, looking no worse for wear, Bob McDonnell, talks about the case and the moment his world came crashing down when a Richmond jury returned a verdict against him.

Bob McDonnell: I listened to 19 guilty verdicts for my wife and me. And all I could do was sob.

Bill Whitaker: You broke down?

Bob McDonnell: Ah. That's all I could do, Bill. At that point, I was a convicted felon with a criminal record who was going to lose my law license, my right to vote, my passport, my reputation and other liberties. And my life was never going to quite be the same.

Bob McDonnell was one of the most popular Virginia governors in recent history. In 2012, he made the short list of Mitt Romney's possible running mates. But in a stunning fall from grace, in 2014, just 10 days after leaving office, McDonnell and his wife Maureen were indicted, then convicted by a jury of conspiracy and bribery. They had accepted $177,000 from a local businessman in personal loans and gifts presented as evidence in court: golf bags and clubs, luxury family vacations, the use of a Ferrari, $20,000 of designer clothes for Maureen and a Rolex watch for the governor. McDonnell appealed his guilty verdict up to the Federal Court of Appeals – and lost twice. But then his conviction was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court last fall.

Bob McDonnell: The worst at all was the-- the-- the belief that much of the public, and much of the nation looked at this, and think, ""There's another corrupt politician.""

CBS News

Bill Whitaker: And if I'm one of your citizens sitting at home in Virginia, and I see you, my governor, getting this money, these loans, these gifts, these trips, I'm-- I'm-- I'm wondering how you justify that. I mean, these things would not have come to you were you not the governor.

Bob McDonnell: That's probably right.

Bill Whitaker: How do you tell the guy, the coalminer sitting in western Virginia that that's OK?

Bob McDonnell: You know, I had to make those judgments, you know, kinda one thing at a time.

Bill Whitaker: And none of that set off alarm bells?

Bob McDonnell: It didn't, because I knew that it was -- completely legal under Virginia law.

Virginia at the time had no limits on gifts to state officials. But McDonnell's case stands out because he took so much from one person -- this man, multi-millionaire Jonnie Williams. Williams wanted the governor's help getting state-sponsored studies of his new tobacco-based supplement called Anatabloc. He claimed it had healing powers. Williams declined to talk to us, but in court he testified under immunity for the prosecution, that he was 100 percent sure he and the governor had an agreement: money and gifts for political favors.

Bob McDonnell: I considered him an entrepreneur. He had the opportunity to create jobs for Virginians.

Bill Whitaker: He plied you, and your wife, with huge sums of money, and gifts. He says that he did it, because he wanted to influence you. What did you think he wanted?

Bob McDonnell: He asked to meet with staff people. I referred him to meetings. My job was just to connect people with government and I considered it a routine part of what I did-- for job creation, and just regular constituent service.

Bill Whitaker: Is that what it takes to get the attention of you guys, somebody coughing up that kind of money?

Bob McDonnell: No.

""Here is somebody who took over $170,000 to do things that he could only do because he was the governor of the state."" Jim Cole

Bill Whitaker: But explain to me where that's-- where I'm-- I'm wrong in seeing ... as--

Bob McDonnell: That is an everyday action in America and I know it to be true from years in politics.

CBS News

But it wasn't politics as usual to Jim Cole. He was the deputy attorney general who oversaw the McDonnells' prosecution.

Jim Cole: He used his office for personal gain.

Bill Whitaker: The governor says all he did was make introductions.

Jim Cole: Here is somebody who took over $170,000 to do things that he could only do because he was the governor of the state.

The McDonnells actively promoted Anatabloc and invited Jonnie Williams to events at the governor's mansion with health care leaders and researchers who could help him.

Bob McDonnell: There was never a quid pro quo, or any conspiracy, or any agreement to help Mr. Williams. And ultimately the Supreme Court of the United States said that government advanced essentially a dangerous legal theory that had serious constitutional problems.

""At the end of the day, the United States Supreme Court said that this was the routine stuff that governors do."" Bob McDonnell

Bill Whitaker: What do you mean dangerous? Why dangerous?

Bob McDonnell: Because it criminalizes routine political conduct, things that happen in this country every day.

The justices did unanimously reverse his conviction – they faulted federal prosecutors for overreaching with a definition of corruption that was too broad and ruled that merely ""setting up a meeting"" or ""hosting an event"" for Jonnie Williams did not constitute a crime. But they condemned McDonnell's conduct on ethical grounds. In his opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the ""tawdry tales of Ferraris, Rolexes, and ball gowns"" did not ""typify normal political interaction…far from it."" In our interview, McDonnell chose to focus on the positive.

Bob McDonnell: At the end of the day, the United States Supreme Court said that this was the routine stuff that governors do. And we may not like the amount of gifts, but it was consistent with Virginia law and so, Bill, that's why at this point, I feel vindicated.

Bill Whitaker: Vindicated? That's not my reading of the Supreme Court decision. Chief Justice Roberts said himself, and this is a quote from his opinion, ""There is no doubt that this case is distasteful. It may be worse than that."" So this wasn't an exoneration. They looked at what you did, and called it tawdry.

Bob McDonnell: Well, I would disagree with that. You've-- you've picked two sentences out of a 28-page opinion. But the import of that opinion, Bill, is not the language that you've read. It's the other 99% of the opinion.

Bill Whitaker: But what I hear you saying is that, ""I will accept 99 percent of what the Supreme Court justices said, but that one percent that sort of slaps my wrist…

Bob McDonnell: No!

Bill Whitaker: …I'm not -- That, they got wrong.""

Bob McDonnell: No, I'm not saying that. I accept that.

Bill Whitaker: They found that your behavior was not something that they sanctioned.

Bob McDonnell: You know, the words are what the words are. I accept 100 percent of the opinion. And so, you know-- with my own conscience that's really between I guess me and God about how I did.

Bob McDonnell ran for office on a campaign of faith and family values. But when the scandal broke, apparently so did the McDonnells. The alleged husband and wife conspirators started coming to court separately. And Bob McDonnell moved here into the rectory of his church.

Bill Whitaker: You were in church yesterday. And you were telling me you were a moral man.

Bob McDonnell: I try to be, Bill.

Bill Whitaker: Did this meet your moral code?

Bob McDonnell: If I do it over again, I was governor, I wouldn't take any gifts. I didn't need 'em.

Bill Whitaker: So why'd you take 'em?

Bill Whitaker: But you're a public official.

Bob McDonnell: Yes.

Bill Whitaker: I think the public believes that you should reach a higher standard.

Bob McDonnell: I knew in my heart I was governing myself properly. And I knew I was making all the appropriate disclosures.

Personal Photo

Virginia law didn't require disclosure of gifts to family members. So, he didn't report this $50,000 personal loan from Williams to a company McDonnell owned with his sister -- or most of the gifts, including the $6,500 Rolex watch Jonnie Williams gave to Maureen to give to the governor.

""I didn't know what a Rolex cost to be honest. I'm a Seiko and Timex guy, and always have been."" Bob McDonnell

Bill Whitaker: Tell me about the Rolex. I've seen the picture. You're holding the Rolex up. You're smiling.

Bob McDonnell: My wife gave it to me for Christmas in 2012. With all my heart, I believed it was from her. She told me it was from her.

Bill Whitaker: You were telling us that you needed loans, business loans. Didn't -- didn't you wonder -- ""How did my wife afford a Rolex?""

Bob McDonnell: Bill, I didn't know what a Rolex cost to be honest. I'm a Seiko and Timex guy, and always have been.

But Maureen McDonnell, a former Redskins cheerleader who brought her pom poms to her husband's inauguration, had a taste for the finer things. On a shopping spree in New York with Jonnie Williams, he bought her $20,000 worth of designer clothing and accessories. Maureen McDonnell declined to speak with us. But Bob McDonnell, who went with her to New York, told us he didn't notice what she bought and didn't ask questions.

Bill Whitaker: If my wife came in with, what was it $20,000 worth of clothing, I would notice the bags, and the boxes. I would say, honey, where'd you get all of this?

Bob McDonnell: I knew she had bags. I knew she shopped. Who paid for those was just not something that we discussed. I'm just not the kind of person that probably paid enough attention on some of those things.

His inattention to his wife became key to his defense strategy. In court, with his liberty at stake, McDonnell allowed his defense team to point the finger at his wife of more than 35 years and tell the jury she was the one taking most of the gifts and, without his knowledge, helping businessman Jonnie Williams.

CBS News

If McDonnell wasn't paying attention, the governor's chef, Todd Schneider was. He told us Jonnie Williams was a regular at the mansion.

Todd Schneider: Remember, everybody talks in the kitchen.

Bill Whitaker: And what were people saying?

Todd Schneider: What we thought of everything that they did, shady. Why is this guy trying to get in here so much the clothes and the gifts and the other things. You, kind of, knew what was going on.

Bill Whitaker: What was going on?

Todd Schneider: Jonnie Williams was trying to get his medicine approved and Bob McDonnell and Maureen McDonnell were getting their bills paid.

There is bad blood between Schneider and McDonnell. After the governor fired him in an unrelated payment dispute that ended up in court, Todd Schneider turned over key evidence to the FBI -- a $15,000 check for catering McDonnell's daughter's wedding. It came from Jonnie Williams' account, Starwood Trust. That triggered the investigation of Bob McDonnell and the federal case under former Deputy Attorney General Jim Cole.

Jim Cole: These were not gifts. These were payoffs.

Bill Whitaker: People are giving money all the time. People make contributions.

Jim Cole: The key difference here is that the contributions didn't go to a campaign. The money that came in went into his pocket. That's not normal politics, that doesn't happen every day.

Hank Asbill: You wanna take the money outta politics, then take it outta politics. But this is not unique to Bob.

CBS News

McDonnell's attorney Hank Asbill admitted the evidence in the case looked bad, but he said, it's just the way American politics works.

Hank Asbill: You know, would anyone look at the gifts and loans in this case and say it's a good idea? No. I wasn't happy about having to defend it, but there was no crime.

Bill Whitaker: But shouldn't we expect our politicians to have a higher standard?

Hank Asbill: Maybe so. And there oughta be a better way of reforming politics in America as usual -- than going after my client and accusing him of committing a crime which he didn't commit.

Bill Whitaker: What do you think the effect of this Supreme Court decision will be on American politics?

Jim Cole: It gives much greater room for public officials to commit improper acts, to commit bribery in subtle ways, and it gives them that room to do it without worrying about getting prosecuted.

The Supreme Court ruling is shaking things up already. Politicians found guilty of bribery in New York, Pennsylvania, Utah and Louisiana are now using the McDonnell case to fight their convictions.

251,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/canadian-polygamous-leader-found-guilty-of-having-25-wives/,cbsnews,Canadian polygamous leader found guilty of having 25 wives,['Crimesider Staff'],"CRANBROOK, British Columbia — Two former leaders of an isolated polygamous community in Canada were convicted Monday of practicing polygamy after a decades-long legal fight, setting up another potential court battle over the constitutionality of Canada's polygamy laws.

Winston Blackmore, 60, and James Oler, 53, were found guilty by British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Sheri Ann Donegan, who said the evidence was clear that Blackmore was married to 25 women at the same time and that Oler was married to five women in the tiny community of Bountiful.

Blackmore, 60, never denied having the wives as part of his religious beliefs that call for ""celestial"" marriages. His lawyer Blair Suffredine has already said Blackmore would challenge the constitutionality of Canada's polygamy laws if his client was found guilty.

""I'm guilty of living my religion and that's all I'm saying today because I've never denied that,"" Blackmore told reporters after the verdict. ""Twenty-seven years and tens of millions of dollars later, all we've proved is something we've never denied. I've never denied my faith. This is what we expected.""

Blackmore and Oler were prosecuted as part of an investigation first launched in the early 1990s by the provincial government.

Under Canadian law, the maximum penalty they will each face is five year in prison. The two will be sentenced at future hearings.

Blackmore and Oler are members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, a breakaway Mormon sect that believes in plural marriage. The group's main base is in a small community on the Utah-Arizona border in the United States.

Oler was chosen to lead the Canadian community just north of the U.S. state of Idaho following Blackmore's excommunication from the sect in 2002 by Warren Jeffs, considered the prophet and leader of the group.

Authorities have said Jeffs still leads the sect from a Texas prison, where he is serving a life sentence for sexually assaulting underage girls he considered brides.

The mainstream Mormon church renounced polygamy in the late 19th century and disputes any connection to the fundamentalist group's form of Mormonism.

At the 12-day trial earlier this year, witnesses included mainstream Mormon experts, law enforcement officials who worked on the investigation and Jane Blackmore, a former wife of Winston Blackmore who left the Canadian community in 2003.

Justice Sheri Ann Donegan praised Jane Blackmore as a highly credible and reliable witness.

""She was a careful witness,"" Donegan said. ""There was nothing contrived or rehearsed in her answers. She was impartial.""

Much of the evidence in the trial came from marriage and personal records seized by law enforcement at a church compound in Texas in 2008. Donegan disagreed with assertions by Blackmore and his lawyer that the records should be given little or no weight, saying she found them reliable.

Donegan said Winston Blackmore's adherence to the practices and beliefs of the religious group were never in dispute, nothing that he did not deny his marriages to police in 2009. Blackmore even made two corrections to a detailed list of his alleged wives, she said.

""He spoke openly about his practice of polygamy,"" Donegan said. ""Mr. Blackmore confirmed that all of his marriages were celestial marriages in accordance with FLDS rules and practices.""

The investigation and attempted prosecution of Blackmore and Oler dragged on for years due to uncertainty about Canada's polygamy laws.

After a constitutional reference question was sent to the British Columbia Supreme Court, the court ruled in 2011 that laws banning polygamy were valid and did not violate religious freedoms guaranteed in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms."

John McCain is expected to return to the Senate Tuesday as lawmakers face a key vote on health care, just days after being diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer.

""Senator McCain looks forward to returning to the United States Senate tomorrow to continue working on important legislation, including health care reform, the National Defense Authorization Act, and new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea,"" his office said in a statement Monday evening.

McCain took to Twitter to also make the announcement saying he looks forward to returning to Senate:

Look forward to returning to Senate tomorrow to continue work on health care reform, defense bill & #RussiaSanctions https://t.co/VQBtovnwF1 — John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) July 25, 2017

The Arizona Republican's attendance in the upper chamber Tuesday could be key in determining whether Senate Republicans are able to open the debate and amendment process on health care reform.

Senators will first vote Tuesday to proceed to the American Health Care Act (AHCA), the health care legislation that narrowly passed the House in early May. To advance to the next step, that will require 51 votes. If that's successful, Senate Republican leaders then expect amendments to be offered to that bill, a Republican aide told CBS News. With McCain's scheduled return, Republicans can only afford two defections on some of the major proposals, assuming Democrats stick together in opposition.

McCain, for his part, has advocated going back to the committee level and negotiating health care reform on a bipartisan basis.

253,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/money-can-buy-happiness-study-says-but-theres-a-catch/,cbsnews,"Money can buy happiness, study says, but there's a catch",['Ashley Welch'],"A new study is challenging the long-held notion that money can't buy happiness.

It turns out, it can — if you use that spare cash to buy yourself some free time, such as hiring someone do common household chores like cooking or cleaning or paying your neighbor's kid to mow the lawn, researchers found.

The study, led by researchers at the University of British Columbia (UBC) and Harvard Business School, is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The researchers surveyed more than 6,000 adults in the U.S., Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands about how much they spent each month to buy themselves free time. The participants also rated their life satisfaction and reported their feelings of stress related to the amount of time they have.

An analysis of the data showed that people who spent money in ways that gave them more free time reported greater life satisfaction.

Importantly, the effect was seen in people across a range of different income levels.

""That was surprising to us,"" UBC psychology professor and the study's senior author Elizabeth Dunn told CBS News. ""It would make sense if this strategy was only something effective once you had a high level of disposable income. But our research shows that that's actually not the case. The strategy is effective for people even at lower ends of the income spectrum.""

That being said, she acknowledges that the study only looked at working adults and wouldn't necessarily apply to those in poorer circumstances.

Dunn first gained interest in this field of study based on her personal experience.

""I originally started studying this topic of whether money could be happiness when I started making money and was puzzled by what to do with it,"" she said. ""I went from being a graduate student living near the poverty line to getting my first faculty job. I had disposable income all of a sudden and wondered what to do with it.""

She became curious if there were anything in scientific literature looking at the optimal way to use money to increase happiness, but she found little in the existing body of research.

Dunn and her team also conducted a field experiment to test whether buying time actually leads to greater happiness. The researchers randomly assigned 60 adults to spend $40 on a time-saving purchase one weekend and $40 on a material purchase another weekend.

The results showed that participants reported greater satisfaction when they spent the money buying time rather than material goods.

""They were less likely to feel time stress and say things like 'there's not enough time in the day.' This is important because we often hear about the role of financial affluence in well-being, but it turns out that time affluence is also pretty important in understanding well-being,"" Dunn said. ""The idea is that if we can promote time affluence by buying time then that should increase happiness.""

Interestingly, despite the benefits of buying time, the researchers found it's not as common a practice as they'd expect.

In a survey of 850 millionaires, nearly half reported not spending any money on outsourcing chores they dislike.

A similar survey of 98 working adults found only 2 percent said they would use an extra $40 on something that would save them time.

Dunn said the research should help people feel less guilty when it comes to spending money to save time.

""If there's a task that you dread doing that is one of the most miserable parts of your week, ask yourself if paying somebody else to do it is something you can afford,"" she said. ""If the answer is yes, even if it seems a bit indulgent, it's probably a good use of money."""

Health care is one of the issues CBS News contributor Frank Luntz discussed with a bipartisan group of Congress members that included three senators and nine representatives. Six were Democrats and six were Republicans.

""The Republicans demonized Obamacare. And the Democrats are demonizing the Republican legislation. Is that the way we should be discussing what may be the most important issue you will deal with this year?"" Luntz asked.

""Some of us probably have philosophical differences. I believe that if you live in America, you've got a right to affordable quality health care. And I think probably everybody agrees on that value. And the difference is how do you get us there,"" Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., said.

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, said Republicans haven't made an effort to work with Democrats on the bill.

""I can speak recently there was no outreach to Democrats in the House to work together. So it wasn't a matter of saying, 'Here is what we're doing. And you're either on you're on board or not.' … There was not a significant, meaningful effort made from the beginning, saying, 'Hey, let's put our heads together and try to work this out,'"" Gabbard said.

""The challenge that we hear on these issues, these jugular issues, is a Republican alternative or a Democrat solution. The American people aren't concerned about labels. They want to know about their health care,"" Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., said. ""People want to know, 'What are my copays? How will I take my child to the doctor? What does it look like if I can't afford it?' If we're not answering those basic questions and if we cannot find a point to rally around, it's our fault.""

Luntz also brought up the multiple investigations into Russia meddling in the U.S. election.

""I think we all have bipartisan support and respect for Bob Mueller,"" Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said of the former FBI director and special counsel leading the FBI investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia.

Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, agreed.

""I worked for Mueller and the Justice Department. He has the utmost integrity. It's in his hands. He will do a thorough investigation. I have every confidence in that investigation,"" McCaul said, adding, ""But I will tell you that I think most of us in this room agree that there should be a consequence to Crimea being annexed, Ukraine being invaded, the Russians interfering in our democracy… And we will have, Frank, a Russian sanctions bill, a sanctions bill against Russia on the floor of the House, I hope, in the very, very near future.""

There was bipartisan agreement with what McCaul said.

""The only person who disagrees with the chairman is the president. … And while he disagrees with it, he's running down NATO, he's running down the European Union and Putin couldn't ask for a better friend than that,"" Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., said.

According to Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., the Russia probe has ""become too much of an issue as to what our real job is.""

""If we're not looking at some level to make this economy dynamic and robust again and getting people back to work, if we're more concentrating on the Russians interfering with our elections as opposed to Russians interfering with our economy right now, and thus turning away from our real job of getting people back to work, seeing wages rise again, seeing families be able to be together,"" Kelly said.

Kelly disagreed, pointing to the need to multitask.

""But congressman, but look, we come here week after week after week, with respect, week after week after week, and do nothing. We don't pass any legislation,"" Bennet said. ""We don't walk and chew gum at the same time. The American people expect us to do that. The Russians attacked our elections. We need to respond to the Russians. And we need to do the work you're talking about on the economy. We need to do both.""

Lastly, Luntz asked the group whether there will be tax reform, and whether it will be bipartisan.

""Right now, I don't see it happening,"" Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., said. ""A lot of big issues out there we need to address. We need to respond to business – to some of the business taxes, corporate taxes.""

""You've set a litmus test already. And it hasn't even begun to be. But isn't that the problem?"" Luntz asked.

""Well, you're talking about values, okay? So in principles – philosophical principles that we have. So I think a lot of us would agree tax code needs to be simplified,"" Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, said. There was bipartisan agreement on simplifying the tax code.

Asked whether Congress can function, Gabbard said ""absolutely.""

""I think the point is about having respect. And here, in this body in Congress, yes, it stems from having relationships. It stems from having an authentic respect for our colleagues, whether we agree on disagree on one issue or almost all issues,"" Gabbard said, adding, ""Because that's what people want from Washington."""

There were seven candidates vying for the position and interviews just wrapped up, CBS DFW reports. City manager T.C. Broadnax had said he was happy to get input from residents during a public meeting with the candidates, but ultimately the decision was his.

Hall has a bachelor's degree in criminal justice from Grambling State University and master's degrees in security administration and intelligence analysis from the University of Detroit Mercy. She is also a graduate of the FBI National Academy.

She was one of two women under consideration to be the next Dallas police chief, along with Seattle Deputy Chief Carmen Best. Under Hall's leadership in Michigan, the city of Detroit experienced a 40-year low in homicides and double-digit reductions in violent crime for three consecutive years.

Hall is expected to begin her job as the new Dallas police chief on September 5.

259,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/raw-chicken-should-you-wash-it/,cbsnews,Does washing raw chicken make it safer to eat?,['Bianca Seidman'],"Though it may seem like good hygiene to wash chicken before cooking it, researchers at Drexel University say people have that all wrong. They've developed a campaign to try to change the misperception, called ""Don't Wash Your Chicken.""

""People are attached to the idea of washing raw poultry,"" Jennifer Quinlan, Associate Professor in the Nutrition Science Department at Drexel University, said in program materials. ""Some think they're cleaning off germs. Some just want to get slime off, or feel like it's dirty.""

Much of the chicken purchased at the supermarket, regardless of which parts or whether or not it has skin, comes with campylobacter or salmonella bacteria. Neither cold or warm water, nor fruit acids will kill those bacteria, which can sometimes cause severe cases of food-borne illness.

The way to make chicken safe to eat is to cook it thoroughly. The internal temperature of the chicken should reach 165 °F as measured with a food thermometer, according to FDA guidelines. Whether it's grilled, baked, fried or slow-cooked, it's the exposure to high heat that kills all the bacteria.

The ""Don't Wash Your Chicken"" program website says: ""If germs were visible to the naked eye, you would see that washing poultry just splashes bacteria all over you, your kitchen towels, your countertops, and any other food you have nearby, such as raw foods or salads. This can make people sick, especially young children, pregnant women, older adults and the immunocompromised.""

To illustrate the risk, a mock infrared animation of ""Germ-vision"" shows how these tiny particles of bacteria can spray far and wide when chicken is washed -- a process called aerosolization.

Quinlan said she discovered how prevalent chicken washing is through the course of her research on the quality and safety of food in minority populations, as part of a USDA-funded program. Through surveys and focus groups in the Philadelphia area, the research team found that washing chicken before cooking was common to several groups. Expanded research showed that the practice is almost universal.

The goal of the campaign is to educate people about the dangers of spreading bacteria and cross-contaminating other foods by washing chicken.

For those who want to take an extra cleaning step to remove sliminess before cooking, the FDA recommends wiping chicken with a disposable paper towel. Then be careful to wash any utensils, plates, cutting boards or kitchen counters that came in contact with raw chicken to avoid spreading the bacteria while you finish cooking."
260,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-did-the-health-care-debate-unfold-this-year/,cbsnews,How has the health care debate unfolded this year?,['Jack Turman'],"The Senate voted 51-50 on Tuesday afternoon on a motion to proceed to a health care bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, with Vice President Pence casting the tie-breaking vote.

For seven years, repealing the health care law has been one of the central organizing principles of the GOP -- but they've found it difficult to deliver on it now that they're actually in power. With the vote on Tuesday narrowly passing, the Senate will begin debate on a bill to replace the ACA that passed the House in March, amending and tweaking it as the process goes on.

How did we get to this moment?

Here's a timeline of health care reform efforts during the President Trump's time in office and during the 115th Congress:

January 20

Mr. Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office aimed at tackling Obamacare's individual mandate. The individual mandate requires Americans to buy health insurance or pay a penalty.

February 5

Mr. Trump gave his administration an extended timeline to repeal and replace Obamacare. When asked if repeal legislation would pass in 2017, Mr. Trump said in an interview with Fox News, ""Yes, in the process and maybe it'll take till sometime into next year but we're certainly going to be in the process.""

February 20

House Republicans praised their outline to repeal and replace Obamacare, as GOP leaders distributed talking points to their colleagues which said their plan ""ensures more choices, lower costs and greater control over your health care.""

February 26

House Republicans circulated a draft of their health care bill, which Democratic lawmakers were quick to criticize.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said the plan was ""a recipe for disaster,"" while House Minority Nancy Pelosi, D-California, noted that the Republican draft would result in millions of Americans losing coverage.

Some of the key provisions in the House Republican bill included the end of Medicaid's expansion, the elimination of taxes on the wealthy and the creation of tax credits up to $4,000.

March 17

House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California, announced a vote on a Republican sponsored bill to repeal and replace Obamacare will be held the following week.

March 23

House Republicans postponed a vote on the American Health Care Act as they didn't have enough support for the bill to pass.

The postponed vote also came in the wake of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) releasing a score on the bill. Their findings estimated that 14 more people would be uninsured by 2018 and 24 more million people uninsured by 2026 under the new plan compared to the current law.

Coupled with the CBO score was the release of a Quinnipiac University poll that highlighted the unfavorable ratings of the House Republican bill. The poll showed that only 17 percent of American voters approve of the AHCA.

During the evening, White House OMB Director Mick Mulvaney indicated to House GOP members that Mr. Trump was finished negotiating on the bill. The President requested a vote on May 24th so that the administration could move onto other items on Mr. Trump's agenda.

March 24

House Speaker Paul Ryan officially cancelled the vote on the ACHA as it didn't have enough support from House GOP members. During his press conference, Ryan said House Republicans ""came up short"" and noted that Obamacare will remain in the ""foreseeable future.""

After Speaker Ryan pulled the bill from the floor, Mr. Trump said Republicans came ""very, very close"" to passing the bill. He added that it is time to ""let Obamacare explode.""

Mr. Trump also pressured the House Freedom Caucus to vote for the legislation. ""The irony is that the Freedom Caucus, which is very pro-life and against Planned Parenthood, allows P.P. to continue if they stop this plan!"" Mr. Trump tweeted.Mr. Trump also pressured the House Freedom Caucus to vote for the legislation.

April 4

The White House proposed a new health care plan to repeal and replace Obamacare as Vice President Pence, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney met with House GOP members.

After meeting with the House Republican conference, Speaker Ryan told reporters there is no legislative text yet and they are in the ""concept stages"" of the bill.

April 26

After not supporting the first version of the American Health Care Act in March, the House Freedom Caucus supported a new version of the bill that included an amendment from Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-New Jersey, that would allow states to apply for waivers from some parts of Obamacare, including the law's definition of essential health benefits and its rules regarding pre-existing conditions. States who wish to obtain a waiver under the proposal would be required to set up a high-risk pool to cover sicker people who might otherwise be unable to purchase insurance, but there were questions about whether the high-risk pools would provide sufficient coverage.

The House Freedom Caucus had been criticized by President Trump for not supporting the original version of the bill. The caucus, a group of roughly three dozen House conservatives, argued that the AHCA wasn't a full repeal of Obamacare. Mr. Trump expressed his frustration with the caucus when he tweeted, ""The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don't get on the team, & fast. We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018!""

The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don't get on the team, & fast. We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 30, 2017

April 30

In an interview with CBS News ""Face the Nation,"" Mr. Trump insisted that pre-existing conditions were covered in the new version of the AHCA. He added that the bill evolved from the original version that failed a month earlier.

""This bill is much different than it was a little while ago, okay?"" he said in the ""Face the Nation"" interview.

May 4

The House passed the updated version of the AHCA with a final vote count of 217-213. The bill passed with 20 Republicans voting against the bill and without any support from Democrats.

The bill includes revamped tax credits, while eliminating Obamacare's individual mandate that requires people to purchase health insurance. The bill would also freeze Medicaid expansion under Obamacare and allow states to receive Medicaid funding as a block grant.

The challenge then moved to the Senate and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham tweeted that Senators should proceed with caution.

May 31

The Kaiser Family Foundation released a poll on the favorability ratings of the ACHA. According to the poll, 55 percent Americans viewed the AHCA as ""unfavorable,"" while 31 percent of Americans favored the bill.

June 22

Senate Republicans released their ""discussion draft"" of their health care bill, which would repeal and replace Obamacare, after weeks of secrecy. The 142 page bill, known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), was supposedly crafted by 13 Senate Republican men in a closed door process. But even some members of that group complained they had no idea what was in the bill, and that it was being written by Majority Leader McConnell's staff.

The Senate is using the budget reconciliation process to get the bill through, which means that Republicans need a simple majority--50 votes plus a tie breaking vote from the Vice President, instead of 60 votes to get the bill through the legislative process. The Senate currently has 52 Republicans and 48 Democrats.

The bill would cut Medicaid expansions under Obamacare and eliminate the Obamacare individual mandate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced the Senate would vote on the measure before the July 4 recess.

June 26

The CBO released their score on the Senate health care bill, which indicated that 22 million more Americans would be uninsured over ten years under the new plan.

This score was similar to the CBO's score of the AHCA, which estimated that 23 more million Americans would be uninsured under that plan.

The dismal forecast was enough for Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah to announce their opposition. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas had already voiced their opposition.

June 27

A day after the CBO score was released on their health care bill, McConnell informed Senate Republicans that a vote on their bill would be postponed until after July 4 recess. McConnell said Republicans lack the votes to pass the legislation as it currently stood.

""We're still working toward getting at least 50 people in a comfortable place,"" McConnell said.

June 30

As Senate Republicans were scrambling to garner votes to pass their bill, Mr. Trump added to the health care debate by tweeting, ""If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date!""

If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 30, 2017

July 4

Some Republican senators who headed home for the July 4 recess were confronted by constituents opposed to the repeal effort. After on event in Kansas, conservative Sen. Jerry Moran said, ""I think at this point, it's time to figure out how … to get rid of the bad things and improve on the things that need to be improved,"" according to Politico.

In Iowa, GOP Sen. Joni Ernst declined to take a stand in support of the Republican bill during her own town hall meeting. ""I am not going to say whether I would or would not support that bill, because I am offering up my own ideas, my own suggestions, and I'd like to see them included in the bill,"" the Iowa senator said, according to the Des Moines Register. ""We'll continue with those discussions.""

July 13

The Senate released a new draft of the BCRA, which included an amendment proposed by Republican Senator Ted Cruz, in their latest effort to repeal and replace Obamacare.

Sen. Cruz's amendment would allow insurers to sell cheaper bare-bones plans if they offer a plan that complies with Obamacare standards. The modified version also would keep three Obamacare taxes on the wealthy and have an increase of $45 billion dollars to combat the opioid crisis.

The bill needed 51 votes, including a tie breaking vote from Vice President Pence, on a motion to proceed, which would bring the bill to floor.

Sen. Collins and Sen. Paul announced they would vote against the motion to proceed on this version of the bill, which meant that Senate Republicans could not afford to lose another vote, assuming that no Democrats would vote for the bill to advance.

July 17

Republican Senators Mike Lee and Jerry Moran announced their opposition to the BCRA, joining Sen. Collins and Sen. Paul.

The four senators expressed they were a 'no' vote on the motion to proceed, which meant McConnell would be unable to even begin work on the amendment process.

McConnell released a statement expressing his disappointment with the Senate being unable to pass a repeal and replace bill. McConnell's statement also indicated that the Senate will vote on the House bill passed in May. The first amendment on the House bill would be to replace the House bill with a bill from 2015, which would repeal Obamacare and give lawmakers two years to devise a replacement. The 2015 bill passed the Senate two years ago.

July 18

Sen. Collins, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia announced their opposition to repealing Obamacare without a replacement. Their announcement to vote 'no' on the motion to proceed complicates McConnell's proposal to hold a vote on repeal only legislation.

At a White House event with military officers, Mr. Trump said to ""let Obamacare fail.""

When discussing the collapse of Obamacare, Mr. Trump added, ""I can tell you that the Republicans are not going to own it. We'll let Obamacare fail and then the Democrats are going to come to us and they're going to say how do we fix it?""

July 19

Mr. Trump hosted a White House lunch with Senate GOP members to make another pitch to repeal and replace Obamacare.

""For seven years, you had an easy route,"" Mr. Trump said to Senate GOP members. ""I don't think we should leave town unless we have a plan.""

Mr. Trump's push for a repeal and replacement plan during the lunch comes a day after he said to ""let Obamacare fail.""

Later in the day, the CBO released its score on the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act of 2017, which is the repeal only bill McConnell said the Senate will vote on after the second version of the BCRA failed to gain enough support. The score displayed that 32 million more people would be uninsured under this plan by 2026 compared to current law.

July 20

The CBO released its score of the second version of the BCRA that included the amendment proposed by Sen. Cruz. The score forecasted that 22 million more Americans would be uninsured by 2026 under the new plan compared to Obamacare.

July 21

The Senate parliamentarian determined that certain provisions in the BCRA violate the ""Byrd Rule,"" which means that these provisions would require a 60-vote point of order, rather than the simple majority granted through the budget reconciliation process.

The Senate Budget Committee released the provisions that violate the ""Byrd Rule"" that would need a 60-vote point of order. Some of the provisions include defunding Planned Parenthood and funding for cost-sharing subsidies.

July 24

Mr. Trump delivered remarks a day before a vote is expected on the motion to proceed to a Senate health care bill.

He urged Senate Republicans to ""keep their promise"" to repeal and replace Obamacare after seven years of campaigning on this issue and unifying behind this promise.

""We, as a party, must fulfill that promise to repeal and replace, what they've been saying for the past 7 years,"" Mr. Trump said.

In the morning, Mr. Trump said Senate Republicans have another opportunity to repeal and replace Obamacare when he tweeted, ""Republicans have a last chance to do the right thing on Repeal & Replace after years of talking & campaigning on it.""

Republicans have a last chance to do the right thing on Repeal & Replace after years of talking & campaigning on it. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2017

July 25

The Senate voted 51-50 with Vice President casting the tie-breaking vote on the motion to proceed to the AHCA, which is the bill the House passed in May.

Sen. Collins and Sen. Murkowski were the only Senate Republicans who voted 'no' on the motion to proceed. All Senate Democrats opposed the procedural vote. Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada, Sen. Capito and Sen. Paul voted 'yes' on the motion to proceed.

After being diagnosed with glioblastoma, a form of brain cancer, last week, Sen. John McCain of Arizona returned to the Senate to vote 'yes' on the motion to proceed. He was welcomed by applause and a standing ovation from Senate members from both parties."
262,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/christian-siriano-perfect-fit/,cbsnews,Christian Siriano’s perfect fit,[],"Designer Christian Siriano has put some pretty big names on the best-dressed list. But it’s his fashions for women of all shapes, shades and sizes that give him a unique style. Serena Altschul has more:

When it comes to fashion, one name that’s trending is Christian Siriano. And with awards season in full swing, the 31-year-old is starting to feel the pressure.

“It is a big moment,” he said of the Oscars red carpet. “Because so many people watch and so many people judge. There’s a lot of red carpet commentary, some unwanted!”

Judging from this year’s Golden Globe Awards, where three stars (Angela Bassett, Rachel Bloom and Issa Rae) wore his designs, and the Emmys, where he dressed nine, his clothes are wearing well.

“So that’s a record then?” Altschul asked.

“I don’t even know if it was a record, but it was quite a lot!” he laughed.

CBS News

Siriano’s client list is impressive. It includes a galaxy of stars, some of whom may shine at tonight’s Academy Awards. But when asked to share who might be wearing Siriano tonight, he demurred. “I can’t, because I don’t know!”

But he does know fashion. Siriano recently revealed his fall line during New York Fashion Week. The theme was “The Desert,” and backstage he was surprisingly cool.

“I try to be a little Zen. I really can’t stress myself out so much. But that five minutes before, when we’re really, like, getting dressed and ready, that’s when it’s scary.”

Fashion is a high-stakes business, but Siriano is willing to take risks. Take a close look at the runway models: they are all shapes, shades and sizes, and it’s all by design.

Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images

“I don’t care what size they are, I don’t care where they’re from. I just want them to feel good in what we’re creating for them,” he said.

That attitude is what brought Siriano to fashion in the first place. Born in Annapolis, Md., he was 13 when he started designing clothes, inspired by his size 16 mother and size 2 sister.

“I had every color, ethnicity, every size, every person around me. So it just wasn’t different. I think that that’s what I’m trying to get people used to, that it should just be the norm. It doesn’t have to be, like, a topic.”

Siriano’s creativity was encouraged by his parents, and in 2004 he moved to London where he interned with celebrated designers Vivienne Westwood and Alexander McQueen.

But when Siriano returned home, he struggled to find work, until he auditioned for the fashion competition show, “Project Runway.”

His highly-theatrical approach to clothing earned him a lot of attention. He became the show’s youngest winner, an experience he looks back on with mixed emotions. “That’s like an actress who can’t stand to be known for a film that she did her whole career, you know? That can be frustrating. But I definitely think now I probably wouldn’t do it.”

“But you wouldn’t be where you are,” Altschul said.

“I definitely would be in a different place than I am now.”

Kevin Winter/Getty Images

Siriano has had his hits and (some think) misses, like this dress worn by actress Christina Hendricks at the 2010 Golden Globes (left).

“We got a lot of hate on that dress. Tons of hate. People hated it! [Someone] said, ‘Don’t put a big girl in a big dress.’”

But it meant the world to him last summer when Michelle Obama appeared at the Democratic National Convention clad in a classic blue dress he designed. “I’m okay with saying that that definitely changed my career.”

Emboldened by success, Siriano willingly broke the high-fashion mold by dressing “Saturday Night Live” actress Leslie Jones, for her 2016 “Ghostbusters” premiere, after her tweet revealed that other designers declined.

And he capped the year off with his marriage to singer-songwriter Brad Walsh.

On the red carpet, the runway, or anywhere, Christian Siriano has made his mark as a designer for every body, like it or not.

Altschul asked, “So when people say, ‘Oh, how could you do that?,’ of course you’re going to take it personally?”

“Yeah. You take it really personally. But then you do it again!” he laughed. “My always thing is, if I waited around for certain people to come around and support [me], I’d still be waiting.”

268,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-transgender-ban-service-members-costs/,cbsnews,Trump says transgender soldiers cost too much -- is that true?,['Aimee Picchi'],"In laying out his reasons for moving on Wednesday to ban transgender people from serving in the U.S. military, President Donald Trump cited the ""tremendous medical costs"" associated with the policy.

His claim raises several immediate questions, such as exactly how much the Department of Defense spends on providing health care for transgender service members, as well as whether there are enough transgender people in the armed forces to move the needle on the department's annual $6 billion in health care spending on active-duty forces.

....victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017

The answer? President Trump's assertion that permitting transgender people in the armed services entails major health care costs appears to be overblown, based on estimates from the think tank RAND, which was asked by the Department of Defense to study the issue last year. Health care costs for treating active members who want to transition to another gender would increase by between $2.4 million to $8.4 million annually, RAND found. That translates to 0.04 percent to 0.13 percent of the agency's annual spending on health care.

""Our study found that the number of U.S. transgender service members who are likely to seek transition-related care is so small that a change in policy will likely have a marginal impact on health care costs and the readiness of the force,"" the Rand researchers wrote.

Likewise, a 2015 study in the New England Journal of Medicine concluded that the health care costs related to transition for transgender service members ""is too low to warrant consideration in the current policy debate."" Its author estimated the costs at $5.6 million annually, or ""little more than a rounding error.""

Mr. Trump's announcement reverses an Obama-era military policy that began last year under which transgender service members may openly serve in the military. Since that policy was implemented, transgender troops have been able to receive medical care and start changing their gender identification in the Pentagon's personnel system.

When former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced the transgender service policies in 2016, he cited RAND's estimate that about 2,500 people, out of 1.3 million active-duty service members, are transgender.

""The medical treatment that service members who are currently transgender requires fairly straightforward, well-understood,"" Carter said at the time in a press briefing to discuss the policy. RAND was ""able to make those estimates. And that was, as they said, minimal.""

Some military personnel are already in the process of changing gender, or have been formally approved to change gender. The numbers are small, however, with the Associated Press noting it currently stands at about 250 service members.

NEW: Former Defense Secretary Ash Carter responds to President Trump's Transgender Ban pic.twitter.com/p8jY1FfXDZ — CBS Evening News (@CBSEveningNews) July 26, 2017

Carter spoke out on Wednesday against President Trump's transgender ban in a statement to CBS Evening News. "" To choose service members on other grounds than military qualifications is social policy and has no place in the military,"" he said. ""There are already transgender individuals who are serving capably and honorably.""

Some conservatives said they supported President Trump's ban. Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Missouri said Wednesday in a statement that ""sex-change surgeries"" would ""cost more than a billion dollars over the next ten years."" She didn't cite a source for her estimate.

Even if the military spent at the top end of the estimated range for health care on transgender service members -- $8.4 million per year -- it would reportedly represent a fraction of what it spends on Viagra. The Department of Defense spent $41.6 million in 2014 on the erectile-dysfunction drug, or about five times what transgender service members would cost, according to an estimate from the Military Times."
270,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/chicago-police-illegal-guns-seized-2017/,cbsnews,"Chicago police: More than 5,000 illegal guns seized this year",[],"CHICAGO -- Chicago police officers have seized nearly 5,200 guns off the streets so far this year -- about 100 more than this time last year, CBS Chicago reports.

Officials with the Chicago Police Department said the city's investment in crime-fighting technology is helping officers.

Tevion Walker is one of the repeat gun offenders driving violence in Chicago, police said. The 21-year-old was arrested Friday and charged with possession of an illegal handgun.

It's Walker's third weapons offense while on parole for another weapons offense from 2015, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said.

Johnson said that Walker and other repeat gun offenders are emboldened by the lack of accountability in Illinois, and he hopes tougher gun laws will change that.

""My goal isn't to incarcerate more people. My goal is to send that message that if you pick up a gun, you'll pay the price for it,"" Johnson said.

Technology like ShotSpotter -- a series of microphones set up designed to detect the sound of gunshots and pinpoint their location -- is helping in some of Chicago's most violent neighborhoods, Johnson said.

""It gives us a head start into, perhaps, capturing those offenders, or at least for recovering the ballistics evidence,"" he said.

The department said shootings are down from 1,868 last year to 1,624 this year. Meanwhile, gun arrests are up, with 2,401 this year compared to 1,820 in 2016.

Murder arrests are also up, with 152 this year compared to 138 in 2016.

Johnson said the real key to solving many of these crimes is help from the community.

""The people in the neighborhoods hear and know who these individuals are, so when the neighborhoods get sick and tired of it, get fed up, and start giving us the information that we need, then we'll start seeing a reduction in gun violence,"" he said.

Johnson said he would also like to see tougher laws that hold people who buy guns accountable when the gun is not reported lost or stolen. He said it would cut down on people buying guns out of state and giving them to criminals in Chicago.

On Tuesday, the department posted an image of 11 weapons on its Facebook page. It said the weapons were recovered after information came in about stolen weapons being transported from Knoxville to Chicago.

Police said they arrested one suspect who now faces felony gun charges."
271,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sunscreen-study-shows-people-apply-it-wrong/,cbsnews,What sunscreen users are doing wrong,['Mary Brophy Marcus'],"Most people don't use sunscreen correctly, a new study shows.

Experts know using sunscreen properly can reduce the risk for skin cancer. And millions of us know we're supposed to do it. But to find out what happens when people actually apply sunscreen in real life, researchers from the University of Minnesota Medical School in Minneapolis set up free sunscreen dispensers at the Minnesota State Fair in 2016. Then they watched as 2,187 people used the dispensers over the next 93 hours.

They discovered that only one-third of people applied the sunscreen to every part of their exposed skin as recommended — and less than half (42 percent) spread sunscreen on their faces.

""Thirty-three percent is actually higher than I thought it would have been, but it was sunny and the free dispenser probably motivated people to do a little better,"" Dr. Darrell Rigel, clinical professor of dermatology at NYU and past president of the American Academy of Dermatology, told CBS News.

When it came to body parts, 51 percent applied sunscreen to their arms, but only 6 percent rubbed it on exposed areas of their chests. The lower extremities were practically ignored with only 3.6 percent of users spreading sunscreen on their legs.

On cloudy days, fewer people used sunscreen at all — even though the researchers note that ""up to 80 percent of the sun's harmful UV rays"" can still reach your skin in cloudy weather.

Their study is published in Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.

To fight skin cancer, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) recommends using one ounce of sunscreen – about the amount that can fit in a shot glass.

""It takes one ounce, theoretically, to cover your whole body,"" said Rigel, who was not involved in the study.

People tend to skimp on sunscreen, applying only 25 to 50 percent of what's really needed, said Rigel. He recommends using a higher SPF product to help compensate for that.

Look for a sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of 30 or higher that says ""broad spectrum"" on the label — meaning that it protects against both UVA and UVB rays.

Wearing sun protective clothing with long sleeves and a hat can also reduce the risk of developing skin cancer.

""With a hat, for every one inch of brim you wear on a regular basis, you lower your skin cancer risk by about 10 percent. A 4-inch brim will lower your skin cancer risk by 40 percent,"" Rigel said.

Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States, according to the AAD. One in five Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime.

Rigel wasn't surprised that women used the sunscreen dispensers more than men in the study, even though the researchers noted that more men attended the fair than women. Women made up 51 percent of fairgoers but 57 percent of sunscreen users.

""Women are better about every health behavior,"" he said, adding that dermatologists know that men delay seeking care when it comes to a spot on the skin that's growing.

Dermatologists say everyone should be using sunscreen, even on overcast days, except for babies under six months of age, whose skin is more porous and sensitive to the chemicals in sunscreens. Rigel recommends parents keep infants out of the sun or well protected in the shade and sun-protective clothing.

Suncreen lasts about two hours then starts to degrade, so you have to keep reapplying for full protection.

""Put it on before you go to work and then when you go out for lunch, reapply it. Most importantly, make sure it's at least SPF 30,"" said Rigel.

All in all, he added, ""I was encouraged that many people used sunscreen, but the study also showed two-thirds of people wouldn't put on free sunscreen, so we have a way to go with public education."""
273,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/coast-guard-lacks-funds-to-chase-drugs-maintain-fleet-commandant-says/,cbsnews,"Coast Guard lacks funds to chase drugs, maintain fleet, commandant says",[],"CHESAPEAKE BAY, Md. -- Congress got an SOS Tuesday from Adm. Paul Zukunft, the commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard.

He said the Coast Guard is busier than ever chasing drug runners, but that it can't do the job without more money.

CBS News was aboard the Coast Guard Cutter Bertholf in 2015 after it seized tons of drugs from fast boats and makeshift submarines. Correspondent Carter Evans got a look at $800 million worth of cocaine that the Coast Guard picked up.

CBS News

Zukunft says that now, the drugs keep coming, and last year, the Coast Guard couldn't even chase hundreds of shipments it knew about.

""There were over 500 events that literally eluded us,"" Zukunft said. ""We knew they were out there. This really came down to we didn't have enough planes, we didn't have enough ships.""

He says much of his fleet is decades past retirement age. And the Coast Guard needs $1.5 billion just to catch up on maintenance.

Chief Warrant Officer Bill Hantzmon is captain of the 55-year-old Sledge.

""This ship is 11 years older than you!"" Evans said.

""It is,"" Hantzmon replied.

CBS News

He and his crew spend their days maintaining buoys and navigational aids, but sometimes, they're forced to jury-rig parts for their own ship because they aren't made anymore.

""They can put you out of commission?"" Evans asked.

""Absolutely. It can keep us from where we are about to do our mission and we have to stay at the pier,"" Hantzmon said.

CBS News

When the Sledge was in port for repair this winter, its age really showed. Repairs were only supposed to take about six weeks, but the ship ended up being dry-docked for six months. Parts of the hull were rusted and had to be cut away and replaced.

Fifty-five is old for a ship, but the Sludge is not the oldest.

""Our oldest is 72 years old,"" Zukunft said.

He says the last thing he'll cut back on are rescues and security patrols. So for now, old ships are being rebuilt as the political fight over dollars and cents plays out."
274,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-kors-still-on-the-cutting-edge/,cbsnews,Michael Kors: Still on the cutting edge,[],"Michael Kors made a name for himself designing clothes for celebrities. But he’s made his fortune with clothes that are “ready to wear” by anyone. He shares his secrets with Rita Braver:

Backstage, the models are frantically prepping to walk the runway. But out in the house where the show will start in just minutes, one man is surprisingly serene:

“Over 35 years of putting on fashion shows, and I don’t get nervous,” said Michael Kors. “But I guess I’m kind of like the expectant dad, you know? This thing has been a long time coming and you want to see that gorgeous baby.”

And indeed, even hardened fashion critics agreed, it was gorgeous! Rufus Wainright sang his heart out, A-Listers like Emily Blunt and Sienna Miller studded the first row, and models of the moment (like Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid) strutted their stuff.

Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images

Fifty-seven-year-old Michael Kors took a victory lap, and why not? It’s been quite a journey.

He showed his first season when he was 21 years old, “and by the time the clothes arrived in the stores, I was 22,” he told Braver. “I knew nothing, I have to tell you. I don’t know what UPS was. I mean, I didn’t know how you actually delivered the clothes to the stores!”

Born on suburban Long Island, he started out as Karl Anderson. But his Mom let him change both his first and last names when she remarried.

And that wasn’t all: at age 5, she brought him to a fitting for her wedding gown.

“And I just sat in the corner making a face,” he recalled. “And my mom said, ‘What’s wrong?’ And I said, ‘I don’t know, it’s just way too busy -- it had a lot of bows.’ And I said, ‘You know what? I think it would look better without the bows.’”

Within a few years of graduating high school, he was working at a Manhattan shop where the owners gave him a chance to design his own creations.

CBS News

The response to the pieces the boutique started having made based on his designs was “Amazing,” he said. “I mean, it was crazy. We’d put it in the window and you know (snaps his fingers) you immediately knew a woman would come in and say, ‘Oh, can I try it on?’ And you’d say, ‘Wait, I’m on to something here; let’s do more of that.’”

His fledgling line caught the eye of one of fashion’s most powerful prognosticators: Anna Wintour, then at New York Magazine:

“I took the collection and I kind of packed it into these big, messy garment bags, and I jumped on the subway, and I went off to see Anna. And I remember it was her fall issue of New York Magazine, and I was her fashion thing to look forward to.”

Today, as Editor-in-chief of Vogue, Wintour still cares enough for Kors to step out on the red carpet with him at a fundraiser he’s hosting for his favorite charity, God’s Love We Deliver, which provides meals to the sick. And yes, she’s wearing Michael Kors.

Braver asked, “What is about his work that you like? What gets you into a Michael Kors?”

“I think Michael has always understood the modern American woman, that he is trying to make her look the best that she can,” Wintour replied. “He’s less concerned about clothes wearing a woman. He wants the woman to wear the clothes.”

And it doesn’t hurt that some of those women are celebrities: Michelle Obama (in her first official portrait), Viola Davis (at this year’s Golden Globes), and Kate Hudson (on many occasions).

“When a woman puts something on, and her whole body changes and her energy changes and her confidence changes, he feels like he’s succeeded,” Hudson said. “And he really, really lives and breathes it.”

There are a lot of boldface names in the world of Michael Kors, such as the outfit Blake Lively wore while pregnant: “She wore it during the day and threw, like, a grey hoodie over it.”

At his flagship store on Madison Avenue, Kors proudly shows off his couture line: sumptuous fabrics, with prices to match.

“The handwork, all of this, is all done by hand,” Kors said.

“This dress must cost thousands of dollars,” said Braver.

“It does. It does. But you’ll have it forever.” And the stretchy fabric will keep fitting.

But the bulk of his sales -- and most of the almost 800 other Michael Kors stores -- are devoted to his lower-priced lines. He also designs clothes for men. But, Kors says, his clients all have similar aspirations: “They want to look fashionable and current. They want to feel powerful but sexy. They want to feel youthful but not ridiculous.”

CBS News

It seems hard to imagine, but at one time, Kors almost lost it all. In the early 1990s, the chief backer for his lower-priced line suddenly ran out of money.

“I remember thinking, ‘Well, if this doesn’t work, like, will I still be me? Will I still be Michael Kors? What will I do?’”

“It must have been so scary for you.”

“Scary. And what I learned from it is, you really have to stick to your guts. You know, you’ve got to stay focused.”

He rebuilt the brand, and then in 2004 he got a call that would change his life: “Certainly, reality television and fashion had not merged,” Kors said of “Project Runway.” “And I knew ‘Survivor.’ And I said, ‘Are designers gonna be, you know, eating bugs and killing each other? What are they gonna be doing?’ I thought it was insane!”

The show, which judged the work of aspiring designers, took off, in part, because of now-legendary quips by Kors like, “It’s tablecloth-y to me.”

But after 10 years, Kors left the show to spend more time on his business, and his marriage with Lance LaPere, his one-time intern who is now creative director of the company.

Braver asked LaPere, “Do you ever tell him, ‘I don’t think so, that’s not a good idea’?”

“Oh, yeah. All the time,” he replied. “It’s always a back and forth.”

And these days, with a net worth estimated at $1 billion, life is very bright for Michael Kors:

“I am still so curious about what is next, and what’s new,” he said. “I think when you lose that curiosity, you know, quite frankly, then you need to do something else. But I feel more juice today than I did when I was 21.”

276,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-an-artificial-intelligence-researcher-fears-about-ai/,cbsnews,What an artificial intelligence researcher fears about AI,['Arend Hintze'],"Arend Hintze is assistant professor of Integrative Biology & Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University.

As an artificial intelligence researcher, I often come across the idea that many people are afraid of what AI might bring. It's perhaps unsurprising, given both history and the entertainment industry, that we might be afraid of a cybernetic takeover that forces us to live locked away, ""Matrix""-like, as some sort of human battery.

And yet it is hard for me to look up from the evolutionary computer models I use to develop AI, to think about how the innocent virtual creatures on my screen might become the monsters of the future. Might I become ""the destroyer of worlds,"" as Oppenheimer lamented after spearheading the construction of the first nuclear bomb?

I would take the fame, I suppose, but perhaps the critics are right. Maybe I shouldn't avoid asking: As an AI expert, what do I fear about artificial intelligence?

Fear of the unforeseen

The HAL 9000 computer, dreamed up by science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke and brought to life by movie director Stanley Kubrick in ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" is a good example of a system that fails because of unintended consequences. In many complex systems – the RMS Titanic, NASA's space shuttle, the Chernobyl nuclear power plant – engineers layer many different components together. The designers may have known well how each element worked individually, but didn't know enough about how they all worked together.

That resulted in systems that could never be completely understood, and could fail in unpredictable ways. In each disaster – sinking a ship, blowing up two shuttles and spreading radioactive contamination across Europe and Asia – a set of relatively small failures combined together to create a catastrophe.

I can see how we could fall into the same trap in AI research. We look at the latest research from cognitive science, translate that into an algorithm and add it to an existing system. We try to engineer AI without understanding intelligence or cognition first.

Systems like IBM's Watson and Google's Alpha equip artificial neural networks with enormous computing power, and accomplish impressive feats. But if these machines make mistakes, they lose on ""Jeopardy!"" or don't defeat a Go master. These are not world-changing consequences; indeed, the worst that might happen to a regular person as a result is losing some money betting on their success.

But as AI designs get even more complex and computer processors even faster, their skills will improve. That will lead us to give them more responsibility, even as the risk of unintended consequences rises. We know that ""to err is human,"" so it is likely impossible for us to create a truly safe system.

Fear of misuse

I'm not very concerned about unintended consequences in the types of AI I am developing, using an approach called neuroevolution. I create virtual environments and evolve digital creatures and their brains to solve increasingly complex tasks. The creatures' performance is evaluated; those that perform the best are selected to reproduce, making the next generation. Over many generations these machine-creatures evolve cognitive abilities.

Right now we are taking baby steps to evolve machines that can do simple navigation tasks, make simple decisions, or remember a couple of bits. But soon we will evolve machines that can execute more complex tasks and have much better general intelligence. Ultimately we hope to create human-level intelligence.

Along the way, we will find and eliminate errors and problems through the process of evolution. With each generation, the machines get better at handling the errors that occurred in previous generations. That increases the chances that we'll find unintended consequences in simulation, which can be eliminated before they ever enter the real world.

Another possibility that's farther down the line is using evolution to influence the ethics of artificial intelligence systems. It's likely that human ethics and morals, such as trustworthiness and altruism, are a result of our evolution – and factor in its continuation. We could set up our virtual environments to give evolutionary advantages to machines that demonstrate kindness, honesty and empathy. This might be a way to ensure that we develop more obedient servants or trustworthy companions and fewer ruthless killer robots.

While neuroevolution might reduce the likelihood of unintended consequences, it doesn't prevent misuse. But that is a moral question, not a scientific one. As a scientist, I must follow my obligation to the truth, reporting what I find in my experiments, whether I like the results or not. My focus is not on determining whether I like or approve of something; it matters only that I can unveil it.

Fear of wrong social priorities

Being a scientist doesn't absolve me of my humanity, though. I must, at some level, reconnect with my hopes and fears. As a moral and political being, I have to consider the potential implications of my work and its potential effects on society.

As researchers, and as a society, we have not yet come up with a clear idea of what we want AI to do or become. In part, of course, this is because we don't yet know what it's capable of. But we do need to decide what the desired outcome of advanced AI is.

One big area people are paying attention to is employment. Robots are already doing physical work like welding car parts together. One day soon they may also do cognitive tasks we once thought were uniquely human. Self-driving cars could replace taxi drivers; self-flying planes could replace pilots.

Instead of getting medical aid in an emergency room staffed by potentially overtired doctors, patients could get an examination and diagnosis from an expert system with instant access to all medical knowledge ever collected – and get surgery performed by a tireless robot with a perfectly steady ""hand."" Legal advice could come from an all-knowing legal database; investment advice could come from a market-prediction system.

Perhaps one day, all human jobs will be done by machines. Even my own job could be done faster, by a large number of machines tirelessly researching how to make even smarter machines.

In our current society, automation pushes people out of jobs, making the people who own the machines richer and everyone else poorer. That is not a scientific issue; it is a political and socioeconomic problem that we as a society must solve. My research will not change that, though my political self – together with the rest of humanity – may be able to create circumstances in which AI becomes broadly beneficial instead of increasing the discrepancy between the one percent and the rest of us.

Fear of the nightmare scenario

There is one last fear, embodied by HAL 9000, the Terminator and any number of other fictional superintelligences: If AI keeps improving until it surpasses human intelligence, will a superintelligence system (or more than one of them) find it no longer needs humans? How will we justify our existence in the face of a superintelligence that can do things humans could never do? Can we avoid being wiped off the face of the Earth by machines we helped create?

The key question in this scenario is: Why should a superintelligence keep us around?

I would argue that I am a good person who might have even helped to bring about the superintelligence itself. I would appeal to the compassion and empathy that the superintelligence has to keep me, a compassionate and empathetic person, alive. I would also argue that diversity has a value all in itself, and that the universe is so ridiculously large that humankind's existence in it probably doesn't matter at all.

But I do not speak for all humankind, and I find it hard to make a compelling argument for all of us. When I take a sharp look at us all together, there is a lot wrong: We hate each other. We wage war on each other. We do not distribute food, knowledge or medical aid equally. We pollute the planet. There are many good things in the world, but all the bad weakens our argument for being allowed to exist.

Fortunately, we need not justify our existence quite yet. We have some time – somewhere between 50 and 250 years, depending on how fast AI develops. As a species we can come together and come up with a good answer for why a superintelligence shouldn't just wipe us out. But that will be hard: Saying we embrace diversity and actually doing it are two different things – as are saying we want to save the planet and successfully doing so.

We all, individually and as a society, need to prepare for that nightmare scenario, using the time we have left to demonstrate why our creations should let us continue to exist. Or we can decide to believe that it will never happen, and stop worrying altogether. But regardless of the physical threats superintelligences may present, they also pose a political and economic danger. If we don't find a way to distribute our wealth better, we will have fueled capitalism with artificial intelligence laborers serving only very few who possess all the means of production.

Andrew Zaragoza, a 16-year-old high school student, allegedly beat his 56-year-old mother, Donna Zaragoza, to death with a hammer.

Police were called to the Jeanett Way residence around 6:30 a.m. on July 20.

Public defender Tim Bahr told Judge David Carey that Zaragoza was a victim of mental, emotional and physical abuse throughout his life, the Baltimore Sun reports.

Last week, the Harford County Sheriff's Office said the residence has a history of drug abuse, mental illness and domestic disturbance, and that there was an overdose death at the home in 2016.

Bahr also told the judge that the teen's father and and uncle both died of drug overdoses last year.

Zaragoza has been charged with first and second-degree murder, first and second-degree assault, and use of dangerous weapon with intent to injure.

Zaragoza is currently being held at the Harford County Detention Center without bail."
280,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/dave-chappelle-netflix-comedy-fame-leaving-chappelles-show/,cbsnews,"Dave Chappelle on fame, leaving ""Chappelle's Show"" and Netflix special",[],"For more than 30 years, Dave Chappelle has been making people laugh. He studied theater at a performing arts high school in Washington and started sneaking into comedy clubs when he was 14. His career exploded after two hilarious seasons of “Chappelle’s Show” on Comedy Central, and then famously walked away at the height of his success.

“I was talkin’ to a guy… he basically said to me that comedy is a reconciliation of paradox,” Chappelle told “CBS This Morning” co-host Gayle King. “And I think that that was a irreconcilable moment for me. That I was in this very successful place, but the emotional content of it didn’t feel anything like what I imagined success should feel like. It just didn’t feel right.”

Chappelle’s now back, this time with a three-part stand-up comedy special on Netflix, premiering Tuesday.

But Chappelle revealed he does miss his former show. “But ‘Chappelle’s Show’s’ like breakin’ up with a girl and you still like her. But in your mind you’re like, ‘That b**** is crazy. I’m not goin’ back,’” Chappelle said, chuckling.

Chappelle not only left the show, walking away from a $50 million deal, but he also left the country, going to South Africa to escape.

“Did the fame scare you?” King asked.

“Fame, yeah, but not so much that I get on a plane to Africa. Fame is not that kind of scary. But it is – fame is a horrifying concept when it’s aimed at you, you know?” Chappelle said. “At the end of the day, it’s so – you don’t have that much control over it. You just try to conduct yourself as best you can.”

For two seasons his best was Comedy Central’s “Chappelle’s Show.” It was critically acclaimed and wildly popular.

“Even when you walked away in 2005, you were still working. It’s just that we didn’t know all the things that you were doing. You really stayed low,” King said.

“I found an altitude I was comfortable with. I found a way that – to do what I liked to do and avoid some of the parts of it that I was uncomfortable with,” Chappelle said.

“What were you uncomfortable with?” King asked.

“Well, I mean, if you look at me, right, physically – now, I’m, like, 40 pounds heavier than I was when I did ‘Chappelle’s Show.’ And people are like, ‘How did you gain all that weight?’ By resting and eatin’ and payin’ attention to myself. I have actual relationships with my kids,” Chappelle said. “I’ve been all over the country, touring all my life. But I never saw anything. Now I’ve seen everything. I could talk to people or I could – I had time to stop if someone said they liked me. It wasn’t like I brushed past ‘em like, ‘I don’t want to hear it.’ I had time to stop like, ‘You do?’ You know what I mean? It’s like – it was just, like, the way that I engaged the world was different.”

He’s starting to get to a point, he said, where he’d like for his life to “mean something” – like when he went to Allen University in Columbia, South Carolina and wanted to talk to the students. His great-grandfather, Bishop William David Chappelle, was once president of the university.

“It’s okay to be afraid because you can’t be brave or courageous without fear. The idea of being courageous is that even though you are scared, you just do the right thing anyway. So in 2004, I walked away from $50 million and in November, I made a deal for $60 million,” he told the students in a speech at Chappelle Auditorium.

He also went to the church, Chappelle Memorial AME Church, also named after his great-grandfather, a piece of his family’s history he wanted to explore.

Chappelle’s own history is rooted in stand-up comedy. He started performing when he was only 14.

“Do you remember when you got your first laugh?” King asked.

“Yeah, first night I was on stage. I can remember who introduced me. I can remember what my introduction was. I can remember the whole thing,” Chappelle said. “This guy named J.T. Newton, he said, ‘You know, folks, everybody starts somewhere. And tonight this young man is doin’ stand-up comedy for the first time.’ He goes, ‘And who knows? We may be witnessing the birth of a star. Please welcome Dave Chapel [sic].’ That was it.”

“But I did pretty good. They were like screamin’. And he’s like, ‘That’s all for you, kid. That’s all for you.’ But they would treat it like I was in the Make a Wish Foundation or somethin’. And they just wanted to give me a little boost. But it was encouraging, man. And it felt so good, you know? You’ll go through a million bad nights to get those good ones,” Chappelle said.

His good nights now involve “Juke Joints” -- part concert, part party. All Dave.

“You never go to a party where everyone shows up at the same time. But the ‘Juke Joint’ is a kind of party where everyone shows up at the same time,” Chappelle said. “And we start and we finish the night together. And it’s just, like – it’s a very eclectic crowd.”

“What do you want us to feel in there?” King asked.

“It’s like, you know, love and camaraderie and kinship, you know? It’s just a reminder. Like, and my town is so small, you throw an event like that in town, it’s the big dance,” Chappelle said.

CBS News

That small town is about 20 miles outside of Dayton, Ohio, and far away from the pressure of big city life. Sometimes, Chappelle will walk on the streets at night.

“Especially when I first get back from the road if it’s nice out. Scary, too,” Chappelle said.

“Why?” King asked.

“Raccoons. You can hear ‘em, like, rustling in the woods,” Chappelle said.

“You scared of raccoons?” King asked.

“Yeah. Very much so,” he said. “That’s an irrational fear that I just have.”

The town is progressive and artsy, a place Chappelle said he’s treated like a neighbor – not a big star.

“Are you calmer here?” King asked.

“Generally speaking, yeah,” Chappelle said. “I have time to think about things. And I think for a comedian, if you don’t have time to think, you’re just not as effective. That if you-- you know, it gets a little corporate.”

It’s that corporate feel he left behind when he departed Comedy Central, where Key and Peele became the comedians to watch.

“I think there was a speculation that Dave doesn’t like Key & Peele or Dave thinks, ‘Okay,’” King said.

“No. I’m a fan of this show,” Chappelle said.

But when he was doing “Chappelle’s Show,” he said there were “certain conventions of the show that the network resisted.”

“I fought the network very hard so that those conventions could come to fruition,” Chappelle said. “So, like the first episode I do, that black white supremacist sketch. And it’s like, ‘Well, that’s 10 minutes long. It should be five minutes long.’ Why should it be five minutes long? Like, these types of conventions. I fought very hard. … So when I watch ‘Key & Peele’ and I see they’re doing a format that I created, and at the end of the show, it says, ‘Created by Key & Peele,’ that hurts my feelings.”

Right now he’s focused on his new creation: three highly anticipated, multi-million-dollar Netflix specials.

“You tell jokes from everything, from race to politics … do you worry about crossing the line or is there a line that you won’t cross?” King asked.

“Comedy is weird. The line, the line moves. It changes,” Chappelle said, adding, “but I think a lot of, especially in comedy, a lot of it has to do with intent.”

“And your intent is?”

“To make people laugh, to reconcile paradox. I’m, like, just openly – sometimes openly venting. I think that when you get to a certain altitude, there’s more scrutiny over the things you say, ‘cause the platform is so powerful,” Chappelle said."

French designer Sophie Theallet, who has dressed First Lady Michelle Obama, tweeted an open letter explaining why she’ll stay away from Melania Trump once she moves into the White House.

“As an independent fashion brand, we consider our voice an expression of our artistic and philosophical ideas. The Sophie Theallet brand stands against all discrimination and prejudice,” the letter says.

Open letter | Sophie Theallet | November 17th, 2016 pic.twitter.com/g1hIAyBmdF — sophie theallet (@sophietheallet) November 17, 2016

Theallet, an immigrant, admits she is “well aware it is not wise to get involved in politics,” but that the bottom line of her business is “not just about money” and she must stand by her values. Those values, she writes, do not align with “the rhetoric of racism, sexism, and xenophobia unleashed by [Donald Trump’s] presidential campaign.”

“I will not participate in dressing or associating in any way with the next first lady,” Theallet says. “I encourage my fellow designers to do the same.”

Designing for the first lady is a high honor in the fashion world, making Theallet’s appeal to her colleagues even more daring. But she is not the first designer to take a stand against the Trumps.

Kaelen Haworth, known for her creations for Blake Lively and Elizabeth Banks, announced after the election that proceeds from items sold on her website would be donated to organizations opposed by Trump. The list includes Planned Parenthood, Black Lives Matter, and Everytown for Gun Safety.

But not everyone is jumping off of the Trump Train, and those who have might buy another ticket soon, says fashion legend Carolina Herrera.

“I think that in two or three months they’ll reach out, because it’s fashion. You’ll see everyone dressing Melania. She’s representing the United States,” Herrera told Business of Fashion."

White House can't say,['Kathryn Watson'],"Incoming White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said President Trump's administration will work to implement his new ban on transgender people in the military lawfully, but she did not supply details on if, how or when transgender service members will have to leave their posts.

Sanders told reporters in a White House press briefing Wednesday that the White House and Department of Defense will work out the details, after the president surprised the political and even military world with the major policy shift he announced in tweets. But the ban leaves many questions unanswered, such as, what happens to current troops, and will they have to self-report their status and leave military? Sanders also offered no timeline for implementing the policy.

It's unclear how much the White House has consulted, or if it has consulted, with lawyers or the broader military community. The Pentagon is referring all questions back to the White House. Sanders repeatedly insisted the president made the ""difficult"" decision after speaking with his national security team and in the interest of ""military readiness.""

""The decision is based on a military decision,"" Sanders said. ""It's not meant to be anything more than that.""

The administration is already facing legal threats. OutServe-SLDN, which offers legal services for LGBT military members, has threatened to take the president to court if he pursues the policy. Other groups like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) are also pushing back against the announcement.

Former Defense secretary Ash Carter ended the ban on transgender people serving openly in the military last year, but permitted a one-year review process for the Pentagon to figure out how to accept new recruits.

Mr. Trump's policy announcement comes shortly after the House rejected an attempt to ban DOD spending on gender reassignment surgery, 209-214, with two Republicans joining Democrats to kill it.

The ban on transgenders in the military seems to contradict Mr. Trump's previous tweets supporting the LGBT community in the 2016 campaign, when he said he would ""fight for you while Hillary (Clinton) brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs."""

Behold, if you dare, the Israeli Deathstalker Scorpion. Its sting is excruciating, its venom can kill.

Getty Images

Sounds terrifying! But Dr. Jim Olson says, ""It's actually beautiful.""

Beautiful, because the Deathstalker's venom may revolutionize how cancer surgery is done.

Dr. Olson is a brain cancer physician and researcher at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, Washington.

""We were inspired by a 16-year-old girl who had a brain tumor,"" he said. ""After 12 hours of surgery, the surgeons left behind a big piece. And we decided that day to find a way to make the cancer light up so that surgeons could see it while they're operating.""

The key is the scorpion venom, synthetically reproduced, minus the poison. When injected into a patient's bloodstream, it sticks to cancer cells but NOT to normal cells. Combine that sticky molecule with florescent dye and you've got what Olson calls ""tumor paint.""

So what problem does tumor paint solve? ""Sometimes, it's really hard for a surgeon to tell what is cancer and what is normal,"" Dr. Olson said. ""And in the brain, you can't take out a big chunk of normal just to make sure you got the cancer. And tumor paint distinguishes clearly the difference between brain cancer and normal brain in all of our experiments that we've done so far.""

Check out this image of a cancerous tumor … inject tumor paint, and there's no mistaking it. The tumor lights up.

""So this is definitive? I can see why you're excited about this,"" said Spencer.

""I am thrilled about this.""

""You're sort of turning nature upside down, right?""

""That's exactly what we're doing!"" he laughed.

Sounds a lot like science fiction, but Dr. Olson says it could be an FDA-approved reality as soon as 2019.

""I think this will potentially be the biggest improvement in cancer surgery, maybe, in 50 years,"" he said.

""God bless the Israeli Deathstalker scorpion!""

""Exactly, exactly. Well, and God bless our patients. Because, you know, they're the ones that motivate us to do this.""

Now, the actress is also bringing her wit and humor to commercials for Enterprise. She talked to CBS News about why her daughters don’t watch “Frozen,” her holiday plans and how she feels about the president-elect.

Tell me what was fun about making these commercials for Enterprise.

It was very collaborative. They were interested in how I interpreted the script. I got to add my own dialogue -- goofy things I would actually say or would find myself doing should I have the ability to run around like a child at any of the Enterprise locations and play with the vehicles.

Do you like driving?

I do. My husband actually races professionally often so it’s his turf but yes, I do.

What are your holiday plans?

We are staying home. We did a fair amount of traveling this year and we’re just hunkering down, watching Christmas movies and celebrating Christmas here with our family at our house in L.A.

Is “Frozen” a staple in your house?

No. They don’t actually watch “Frozen,” believe it or not! I put it on for them and it was a little too scary. They like the characters but they don’t really watch the movie. We do a lot of PBS Kids. Their attention span is not two hours as of yet, so we do the 11-minute TV show programs when they watch TV.

Do they understand that that’s you as Anna, though?

They do because we talk about it with them -- what we do for a living -- and they know there’s a real person behind the voices of the cartoons they watch and my daughter was watching a cartoon and said, “They’re not real, but there is a person behind them doing a voice.” And I was like, “Yeah, oh my gosh, you get this.”

She sounds really smart.

She knows Idina is Elsa. She knows Josh is Olaf. She’s able to associate humans with characters, which I think is rare for a three-year-old.

What can you tell us about “Frozen 2”?

I wish I knew. We haven’t seen anything yet. I thought we’d be recording by now but they’re still working on the script. But we did an Olaf special that comes out next Christmas and the music has been written for it.

There’s been a lot of talk about how “Frozen” really diverges from traditional princess stories and embraces strong women. How does it feel to be part of a project like that?

I feel proud. I don’t love stories that have just a bad guy and you never explore what made them bad or sad and “Frozen” did a great job with that. We talk with the kids about why the bad guy is sad and what made him sad and grumpy. I was really proud “Frozen” didn’t really have a villain, or at least not in Elsa. She was a very complex, misunderstood character. I was really proud of representing that story.

You represent lots of viewpoints on social media or in your art. You’ve talked about mental health, the Syrian refugee crisis, equal pay -- what’s been the best part of having the platform you have?

Just knowing I can be a voice for people who feel voiceless. There are important issues that many of us don’t see on a day-to-day basis in the comfort of our lives and I am definitely included in that. I don’t run into refugees here in L.A. but I stay abreast of what’s happening because people are important to me.

You were pretty vocal against Donald Trump during election season. Now that he’s our president-elect, how do you feel about moving forward?

I think it’s important to unify our country again. I think the most important thing is to listen, to hear other people and hear where they’re coming from. I think understanding people is the only thing that works.

Speaking of equal pay, was there a time in your career when you felt particularly discriminated against for being a woman?

286,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-details-emerge-on-linkin-park-frontman-chester-benningtons-suicide/,cbsnews,New details emerge on Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington's suicide,[],"LOS ANGELES -- New details have emerged on Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington's suicide.

Police in Palos Verdes Estates released audio Monday to The Associated Press of a hired driver's 911 call in the singer's death.

The driver told authorities he had pulled up for a pickup at Bennington's house and was alerted by a housekeeper that she had found Bennington's body hanging in a bedroom. Her loud sobs can be heard in the background of the call.

The driver told police he had not seen the body himself.

On Friday, the Los Angeles County coroner ruled his death a suicide by hanging. Watch Commander Lt. Rudy Molano said an autopsy was conducted on July 21.

Coroner office spokesman Ed Winter's confirmed last week that no drugs were evident in Bennington's room.

Bennington's suicide echoed that of his good friend, Chris Cornell, who hanged himself in May. He had a strong bond with Cornell and died on what would have been the Soundgarden singer's 53rd birthday on Thursday.

Members of Linkin said say their hearts were broken following the death of their lead singer. The rock band said ""shock waves of grief and denial are still sweeping through our family as we come to grips with what has happened"" and added that Bennington ""touched so many lives, maybe even more than you realized.""

Linkin Park had planned to launch a tour this week, but canceled it following Bennington's death. Their hits include ""In the End"" and ""Numb."""
288,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/louise-penny-how-writing-became-her-solace/,cbsnews,Louise Penny: How writing became her solace,[],"The loyalty of her millions of readers speaks volumes about the appeal of Louise Penny's mystery novels. Martha Teichner traveled to Penny's hometown to see for herself:

There should be a name for fans of Louise Penny's murder mysteries: The L Pack, or the Penny Posse maybe.

Minotaur

To say they come from far and wide in large numbers to attend her book events is no exaggeration. They've come all the way to the Canadian town of Knowlton, in the eastern townships of Quebec, where Penny lives, and her books are set.

""Some of you have come a great distance with me,"" Penny said to them, ""so I'm thrilled to meet each and every one of you.""

It's as if her readers want to immerse themselves in the setting of her books, which are as much about the backstories of her murders -- why people kill -- as whodunit. Penny has published 12. They now routinely debut at number 1 on the New York Times bestseller list, or close to it.

Her next, ""Glass Houses,"" comes out next month.

""My books are about many, many things, probably least of all murder,"" Penny said. ""They're about life. They're about choices, and taking responsibility for what you do. But really, I think at their heart, they're about love and friendship.""

And food. (Her characters all eat exceptionally well.)

The made-up village of Three Pines (which Penny, tongue-in-cheek, informs readers can't be found on any map, although her publisher has conveniently had one drawn) is meant to be a safe place -- a refuge or sanctuary for people who are lost.

CBS News

The name has historical significance. Legend has it, during the American Revolution, the trees were a signpost for loyalists to the British crown fleeing north to Canada, to safety. ""So what people would do is, they would plant a cluster of three pine trees on their home, when they were at the border, as a signal to these people that they were safe,"" Penny said. ""And that's how I got the name for the village.""

Her detective is Chief Inspector Armand Gamache. ""If I got lucky enough that the books were published and became a series, I didn't want to grow weary of my main character. So, I decided I would create a man I would marry,"" Penny said.

But before Penny herself managed to find Three Pines and all its inhabitants, she, too, was lost: ""I was drinking more and more and more. The phone never rang. The doorbell never sounded.""

She had it made, or so it seemed. From the age of 21, she was a reporter and then an anchor for CBC radio, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. But she was also a secret drunk. At 35, she walked into an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, and changed her life.

""I left that meeting never having to drink again,"" she told Teichner. ""It was unbelievable. The urge to drink, the need to drink disappeared.""

Not long afterward, she met and married Dr. Michael Whitehead, a noted pediatric hematologist more than 20 years her senior, who told her that he would support her if she quit her job to write. For five years she tried to write the Great Historical Novel.

But then: ""I looked at the bedside table, and very well represented there were crime novels. It was one of those moments where I just thought, Oh, maybe that's what I should write.""

That first book was called ""Still Life."" ""Quebec is a character, a very real character in the books,"" she said. ""There is a very keen sense of place.""

With each new book, Penny's following has grown, her fans seeking a piece of her fictional and real worlds -- the line between them often blurry.

CBS News

Readers are convinced Kelly Shanahan's bakery is the bakery in the books. ""People come in absolutely expecting that Louise Penny is here somewhere,"" Shanahan said.

And on this particular day, a Louise Penny sighting does indeed occur.

The local bookstore, Brome Lake Books, has become a stand-in for Myrna's New and Used Bookstore in the novels. ""We usually have at least three groups a day coming through, not counting the bus tours and things like that,"" said owner Danny McAuley. ""They're really looking for a connection to Louise. The books have touched them. They've touched them personally; they've been healed by the books.""

louisepenny.com

And Penny has been extraordinarily open about her own life. Each month for her website, she writes what reads like an intimate letter to a close friend. It was there, in 2014, that she disclosed her beloved husband, Michael, had been diagnosed with dementia, and then last fall that he had died.

""So many others have been down this road before Michael and me -- there's comfort in that,"" Penny said.

When fans show up for book signings, it's not just about the books.

One fan, Marie Josee Pilon, told Teichner, ""I love her books, but I love the individual. She's become part of a family.""

Louise Penny has never laid eyes on most of these people before, but they are not strangers. After all, she showed them the way to Three Pines, the sanctuary where she has now gone to find herself once more, in her sadness.

""The writing became a harbor, it became a solace,"" Penny said. ""It became a world I could control. Oddly enough, all the decisions I had made 12 years ago, about a place that I would like to live in and people I would choose as friends, turned out to be my saving grace.""

""It would prompt a firestorm,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).

Members of both parties are warning the president not to mess with Mueller.

""Firing Bob Mueller without cause is an attack on the rule of law,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).

CBS News

""It sort of looks paranoid to me,"" said Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee. ""If he fired Bob Mueller, I think you'd see a tremendous backlash response from both Democrats but also House Republicans.""

Respect for Mueller runs deep on Capitol Hill, especially among Republicans.

He was President George W. Bush's pick for FBI director, and served throughout the Bush presidency.

House Speaker Paul Ryan has had the same message for Mr. Trump since Mueller was tapped as special counsel in May: ""I think the best advice would be to let Robert Mueller do his job.""

Republicans were also stunned by the president's slam on their former Senate colleague Jeff Sessions, who is now attorney general.

""Jeff Sessions takes the job, gets into the job, recuses himself. I then have -- which, frankly I think is very unfair to the president,"" Mr. Trump told The New York Times.

Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley says Sessions was right to recuse himself.

""The attorney general can't be a wingman for a president. He's got to be very independent,"" Grassley said.

As for those attempts to dig up dirt on Mueller or his staff, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio says good luck.

""I don't think it's going to influence Bob Mueller's work one way or another,"" Rubio said. ""I'm pretty confident just knowing him and knowing the way he conducts himself he doesn't wake up in the morning and read those things and have them impact his ability to do his job. He's going to do his job.""

Some Republican aides on Friday praised the choice for new White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, emphasizing his poise and charisma. Others complained that Scaramucci has no experience with communications planning and strategy -- something they think this White House badly needs."
290,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/debt-ceiling-will-be-hit-in-october-cbo-estimates/,cbsnews,"Debt ceiling will be hit in October, CBO estimates",['Rebecca Shabad'],"The federal government will exhaust its so-called extraordinary measures and hit the debt ceiling in ""early-to-mid October,"" the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected in a report released Thursday.

Without an increase in the debt limit, CBO said the Treasury can use extraordinary measures ""to continue borrowing and have sufficient cash to make its usual payments"" until that October deadline. The government has been relying on the extraordinary measures since mid-March when the suspension of the debt ceiling expired.

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin called on Congress in May to raise the debt limit before lawmakers leave for the summer in August and specified that it should be a ""clean"" increase -- a demand that the conservative Freedom Caucus has rejected.

Congress was able to wait until October in 2015, the last debt ceiling deadline, to raise it. It was part of a bipartisan budget agreement that also lifted spending levels for two years that applied to defense and non-defense domestic programs.

Budget experts expect the GOP-controlled Congress to produce a similar agreement this fall since Republicans need Democratic votes in the Senate to pass spending bills whose limits will stem from a budget agreement."
292,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-mark-zuckerberg-clash-artificial-intelligence-robert-safian-fast-company/,cbsnews,Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg clash over risks of artificial intelligence,[],"Two tech billionaires are clashing over the future of artificial intelligence.

Tesla co-founder Elon Musk warned this month that AI is a ""fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization.""

""I keep sounding the alarm bell but, you know, until people see robots going down the street killing people they don't know how to react, 'cause it seems so ethereal,"" Musk said at the National Governors Association.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg criticized those comments, without referring to Musk by name, during a Facebook Live broadcast from his backyard.

""I think that people who are naysayers and kind of try to drum up these doomsday scenarios are – I don't understand it. It's really negative and in some ways I actually think it's pretty irresponsible,"" Zuckerberg said.

Musk fired back Tuesday in a tweet: ""I've talked to Mark about this. His understanding of the subject is limited.""

The editor of Fast Company magazine, Robert Safian, told ""CBS This Morning"" Wednesday, ""I think they're both right and they're both wrong.""

Safian pointed out that there are a lot of words used when referring to artificial intelligence, or the ability of computers to ""learn"" from a growing body of data to improve their accuracy over time. ""Artificial intelligence, machine learning, cognitive computing. We use different words to describe the same thing, sometimes we use the same word to describe different things. All this gets confusing in this way.""

Safian acknowledged that technological advances can make people ""anxious.""

He called Musk's concerns a ""doomsday-oriented scenario"" but also said that what the SpaceX CEO is really talking about is a need for ""more oversight and some sort of regulatory apparatus to make sure technology and AI develops in a certain way.""

The tech moguls' differing ""philosophical point of view"" also contributes to their disagreement on this issue, Safian said.

""Now, Mark Zuckerberg believes that – one of the things he loves about technology and software is you can constantly improve it. So if there's a problem we'll fix it. That's sort of Mark's approach to things,"" Safian said.

Despite their disagreement, both Musk's and Zuckerberg's businesses rely on the advancement of artificial intelligence.

""Remember Elon Musk is the guy who wants to, you know, have us live on other planets, right? And that may happen but it's a long time until that happens. What do we put in place between here and there to make sure this technology is used in an effective way. And that's really what Elon is trying to encourage us to think about,"" Safian said. ""These things always happen. In the long lens of history technology has always improved the human condition."""
294,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/pork-falls-from-sky-lands-on-home-travis-adair-florida-mystery/,cbsnews,15-pound bag of frozen pork lands on family's Florida home,[],"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- Meat falling from the sky is weird, even by Florida standards.

But that's what happened at 4 a.m. Saturday when a 15-pound bag of frozen pork landed on the Deerfield Beach home of Travis Adair and his family.

Adair said Thursday that the package hit his roof with a ""big bang."" He thought it was thunder, but his wife Jennie later went outside and found two bundles next to the house. His son Austin found three on the roof.

""It had to fall from the sky,"" Adair said. ""It was too heavy to throw on the roof."" The home is near three airports, so Adair thinks it fell from a plane.

The Federal Aviation Administration had no immediate comment Thursday.

Labeling on the package shows it originally belonged to Jim Williams, who lives 170 miles away in Myakka City, a rural town of 6,300 residents. Williams, who owns a company that prepares fields for planting, said Thursday he bought some pigs from some children at a county fair in January. He kept much of the meat and gave some away but he has no idea how any of it ended up on the Adairs' roof. He is not a pilot and doesn't own a plane.

""I would have thought 15 pounds of frozen meat falling from an airplane would have put a hole in the roof,"" Williams said.

His friend, Jimmy Fussell, who owns the butcher shop that processed the pigs for Williams, said the mystery, which was featured on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!,"" certainly ""beats hearing about all the politics going on."" And it has given everyone in Myakka City a laugh.

As for the meat, the Adairs threw it away -- though Williams has offered to throw the family a barbecue."
295,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/south-carolina-domestic-violence-law-unfair-to-gay-couples-court-rules/,cbsnews,"South Carolina domestic violence law unfair to gay couples, court rules",[],"COLUMBIA, S.C. -- People in same-sex relationships in South Carolina should get the same legal protections against domestic violence as heterosexual couples, the state's highest court ruled Wednesday, deeming a portion of the state's domestic violence law unconstitutional.

The court was asked to weigh in after a woman tried to get a protective order against her former fiancée, also a woman, and was denied.

Current law defines ""household members"" as a spouse, former spouse, people with a child in common, or men and women who are or have lived together. It does not include unmarried same-sex couples.

Acting Justice Costa Pleicones, who wrote the majority opinion, said during oral arguments in March 2016 that he felt the law was ""pretty clearly unconstitutional in its discriminatory impact upon same-sex couples.""

In his opinion, Pleicones pointed out lawmakers have over the years addressed the definition of ""household members"" as covered under domestic violence protections in 1994, amending the language from ""persons"" living together to ""male and female."" In 2015, during a massive overhaul of South Carolina's criminal domestic violence law, legislators made changes including increasing penalties for offenders but left the gender-based definition intact.

The U.S. Constitution's Equal Protection Clause, the court wrote, states, ""No state shall ... deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,"" such as a benefit offered to one class of person but not others.

""In this case, we cannot find a reasonable basis for providing protection to one set of domestic violence victims -- unmarried, cohabiting or formerly cohabiting, opposite-sex couples -- while denying it to others,"" the court wrote.

Other states have addressed this issue since the U.S. Supreme Court's 2015 decision legalizing gay marriage nationwide. The Ohio Supreme Court in 2016 adopted the use of gender-neutral references in family court cases. California and Massachusetts proactively changed language in their laws.

Beth Littrell, an attorney with Lambda Legal, said while it would be great for state legislatures across the country to update language to protect same-sex couples in domestic violence situations, courts like South Carolina's should be commended for ensuring laws were applied equally.

""The Supreme Court of South Carolina absolutely came down on the right side of the law and of history,"" she said. ""Same-sex couples should be treated and recognized by the law as entitled to equal dignity. That's what the U.S. Supreme Court said, and now that what the South Carolina Supreme Court has said.""

Attorney General Alan Wilson, whose office argued the case on behalf of the state, said he would ask the court to reconsider its ruling. In a statement, Wilson said he supports an approach to ""reconcile our state's domestic violence laws with U.S. Supreme Court precedent"" but that his office has defended the constitutionality of the current law, which only allows the state to protect spouses, former spouses and people with children in common.

Bakari Sellers, a former legislator and an attorney for the woman who brought the case, told the Associated Press that the case was an opportunity to push South Carolina forward.

""We all know that South Carolina is usually a few decades behind the rest of the union, but that it takes good people of all walks of life to set aside prejudice and preconceived notions,"" Sellers said. ""Today, love won."""
296,http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/oregon-scientists-human-gene-embryo-editing-us-48882536,go,"In US first, scientists edit genes of human embryos",['Abc News'],"For the first time in the United States, scientists have edited the genes of human embryos, a controversial step toward someday helping babies avoid inherited diseases.

The experiment was just an exercise in science — the embryos were not allowed to develop for more than a few days and were never intended to be implanted into a womb, according to MIT Technology Review, which first reported the news.

Officials at Oregon Health & Science University confirmed Thursday that the work took place there and said results would be published in a journal soon. It is thought to be the first such work in the U.S.; previous experiments like this have been reported from China. How many embryos were created and edited in the experiments has not been revealed.

The Oregon scientists reportedly used a technique called CRISPR, which allows specific sections of DNA to be altered or replaced. It's like using a molecular scissors to cut and paste DNA, and is much more precise than some types of gene therapy that cannot ensure that desired changes will take place exactly where and as intended. With gene editing, these so-called ""germline"" changes are permanent and would be passed down to any offspring.

The approach holds great potential to avoid many genetic diseases, but has raised fears of ""designer babies"" if done for less lofty reasons, such as producing desirable traits.

Last year, Britain said some of its scientists could edit embryo genes to better understand human development.

And earlier this year in the U.S., the National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Medicine said in a report that altering the genes of embryos might be OK if done under strict criteria and aimed at preventing serious disease.

""This is the kind of research that the report discussed,"" University of Wisconsin-Madison bioethicist R. Alta Charo said of the news of Oregon's work. She co-led the National Academies panel but was not commenting on its behalf Thursday.

""This was purely laboratory-based work that is incredibly valuable for helping us understand how one might make these germline changes in a way that is precise and safe. But it's only a first step,"" she said.

""We still have regulatory barriers in the United States to ever trying this to achieve a pregnancy. The public has plenty of time"" to weigh in on whether that should occur, she said. ""Any such experiment aimed at a pregnancy would need FDA approval, and the agency is currently not allowed to even consider such a request"" because of limits set by Congress.

One prominent genetics expert, Dr. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Translational Science Institute in La Jolla, California, said gene editing of embryos is ""an unstoppable, inevitable science, and this is more proof it can be done.""

Experiments are in the works now in the U.S. using gene-edited cells to try to treat people with various diseases, but ""in order to really have a cure, you want to get this at the embryo stage,"" he said. ""If it isn't done in this country, it will be done elsewhere.""

There are other ways that some parents who know they carry a problem gene can avoid passing it to their children, he added. They can create embryos through in vitro fertilization, screen them in the lab and implant only ones free of the defect.

Dr. Robert C. Green, a medical geneticist at Harvard Medical School, said the prospect of editing embryos to avoid disease ""is inevitable and exciting,"" and that ""with proper controls in place, it's going to lead to huge advances in human health.""

The need for it is clear, he added: ""Our research has suggested that there are far more disease-associated mutations in the general public than was previously suspected.""

Hank Greely, director of Stanford University's Center for Law and the Biosciences, called CRISPR ""the most exciting thing I've seen in biology in the 25 years I've been watching it,"" with tremendous possibilities to aid human health.

""Everybody should calm down"" because this is just one of many steps advancing the science, and there are regulatory safeguards already in place. ""We've got time to do it carefully,"" he said.

Michael Watson, executive director of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, said the college thinks that any work aimed at pregnancy is premature, but the lab work is a necessary first step.

""That's the only way we're going to learn"" if it's safe or feasible, he said.

Lulu Castle, 2, is not one of those kids.

Her mom, Natalia Castle of Virginia Beach, Virginia, posted a hilarious -- and honest -- photo of Lulu when she found out she was going to have a baby brother.

She captioned it, ""She didn't take the news so well. But we cannot wait!"" Lulu is pictured on the floor crying in front of a sign announcing the baby boy's arrival in January 2018.

Castle told ABC News, ""Let's just say Lulu enjoys getting all the attention."" The little girl had attempted to scribble out the announcement with a piece of chalk just prior to the photo being taken, her mom said.

301,http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/qatar-hires-firm-founded-trump-aide-amid-crisis-48879363,go,Isolated Qatar hires firm founded by Trump aides amid crisis,['Abc News'],"Qatar has hired a Washington influence firm founded by former top campaign aides to President Donald Trump and another specialized in digging up dirt on U.S. politicians, signaling it wants to challenge Saudi Arabia's massive lobbying efforts in America's capital amid a diplomatic dispute among Arab nations.

Hiring a firm once associated with former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who left it in May over a dispute with his partners, shows Qatar wants access to a White House with close ties to Saudi Arabia. The firm retains Barry Bennett, a Trump campaign adviser, as well as others with ties to the president.

But matching Saudi Arabia, which scored a diplomatic coup by hosting Trump's first overseas trip, could be a tough battle for Qatar, even if it does boast the world's highest per-capita income due to its natural gas deposits.

""The Qataris are belatedly working up to the scale of the challenge they face,"" said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a research fellow at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University who lives in Seattle. ""This whole crisis, now that it's kind of settled down into a prolonged confrontation or standoff, it's become almost a struggle to win the hearts and minds in D.C.""

The Gulf rift already has seen slogan-plastered taxicabs in London, television attack ads in the United States and competing messages flooding the internet and state-linked media on both sides since the crisis began on June 5.

Qatar, in the midst of building stadiums for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, isn't afraid to spend its money. Since the crisis began, Qatar paid $2.5 million to the law firm of former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft to audit its efforts at stopping terrorism funding — one of the allegations levied by the Saudi-led quartet of nations.

According to documents newly filed to the U.S. Justice Department, Qatar has hired Avenue Strategies Global for $150,000 a month to ""provide research, government relations and strategic consulting services."" The contract also says that activity ""may include communications with members of Congress and Congressional staff, executive branch officials, the media and other individuals.""

Lewandowski founded Avenue Strategies just after the November election that put Trump in the White House. Lewandowski resigned from the firm only months later, saying he was troubled by a firm-related project he hadn't sanctioned. Others tied to Avenue Strategies had started a firm of their own, pitching Eastern European clients with promises of access to Trump and high-ranking White House officials.

The firm, which includes a former chief of staff to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.

Qatar also signed a three-month, $1.1 million renewable contract with the opposition research firm Information Management Services, according to a Justice Department filing .

The firm, run by Jeff Klueter, a former researcher for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, did not respond to requests for comment. It advertises itself as doing so-called ""oppo,"" which includes digging into political opponents' past and comments for incriminating or simply embarrassing material.

Qatar did not respond to a request for comment about the lobbying contracts. But it may serve as recognition that while Qatar has had success in speaking with the State Department and the Pentagon, it needs to make inroads to the Trump White House, Ulrichsen said.

Despite hosting a major U.S. military base, Qatar has been a target of Trump over its alleged funding of extremists, something Doha denies. Saudi Arabia enjoys close relations to Trump, as well as his son-in-law Jared Kushner.

In Washington, Saudi Arabia spends millions of dollars on lobbying, including a most-recent push to oppose a law allowing Sept. 11 victims' families to sue the ultraconservative Muslim nation in U.S. courts . Its lobbying firms have been putting out memos on Qatar.

Meanwhile, an organization called the Saudi American Public Relation Affairs Committee launched an online campaign called the Qatar Insider highlighting material critical of Doha. The committee also paid $138,000 to air a 30-second anti-Qatar attack ad on a local Washington television station during ""Meet the Press"" and the British Open, according to filings to the Federal Communications Commission.

""Our aim is to show the American people that Qatar has been employing a foreign policy that harms its neighbors and contributes to regional instability,"" said Reem Daffa, the executive director of the committee, known by the acronym SAPRAC.

But while Daffa said SAPRAC does no lobbying, it has registered as a lobbying firm with Congress and tweeted a Qatar attack ad at Trump . It also has not filed paperwork with the Justice Department despite the committee being listed as entirely owned by a Saudi national .

The Foreign Agents Registration Act, first put in place over concerns about Nazi propagandists operating in the U.S. ahead of World War II, requires those working on behalf of other countries or their citizens to file regular reports to the Justice Department.

There are no similar rules in Britain, though the crisis recently could be seen on the streets of London. Pro-Qatar ads appeared on the city's famous black taxis, bearing the message: ""Lift the Blockade Against the People of Qatar."" Al-Jazeera Arabic even did a story about them.

But whether any of it will sway policy makers remains unclear.

""The prevailing view is that there are no perfect allies,"" recently wrote Steven A. Cook, a senior fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations. ""So whatever money the Gulf countries are spending in Washington, they should know it is not very well spent.""

Cena, who was recently diagnosed with terminal bone cancer, was a bomb-sniffer for the Marines until his retirement in 2014. The celebration for Cena was organized by his owner, Lance Cpl. Jeff Young, who was paired with the dog in 2009 and 2010 while on a combat tour in Afghanistan and who adopted him in 2014. Cena then became DeYoung's service dog to help him with his post-traumatic stress disorder.

""My whole adult life I've had Cena,"" DeYoung said. ""When I was 19 overseas learning how to be responsible, I had Cena. And now I'm 27 and I'm having to say goodbye to one of the biggest pieces of my life.""

DeYoung said he has carried Cena across rivers and thrown his body over him while under heavy fire from the Taliban. He said Cena kept DeYoung's body warm during cold desert nights, and comforted him when he lost seven friends in three weeks.

As part of the celebration, DeYoung took his dog on one last ride in a topless Jeep that was decorated and named ""Cancer Response Team.""

""It started off with my basically wanting to go to a dealership and wanting to borrow a Jeep for a day and really small to a community tribute or a community parade for him and he's truly deserved it all,"" DeYoung said. ""The support, all the love people are giving him, he can see it and he can feel it.""

The ceremony was attended by the U.S. Marine Corps League, Michigan State Police, Muskegon County Sheriff's Office, Muskegon City Police, Muskegon Fire Department and officers from several other departments, including a canine officer named Rex. Attendees gave one final three-volley salute with ""Taps"" playing in the background for Cena, who was wearing a decorated blue Marine vest.

""Lord, it is with heavy hearts that we are sending another Marine to you today,"" said chaplain Wesley Spyke as he addressed the crowd in prayer.

A GoFundMe page was set up for donations to help build a headstone for Cena.

""Any dog that served overseas deserves exactly what I've done for Cena, if not more,"" DeYoung said.

The series ""chronicles the events leading to the Third American Civil War,"" according to a news release from HBO. ""The series takes place in an alternate timeline, where the Southern states have successfully seceded from the Union, giving rise to a nation in which slavery remains legal and has evolved into a modern institution.""

HBO president Casey Bloys said Wednesday at the Television Critics Association’s press tour in Beverly Hills, California, that the show's rollout was ""misguided.""

Still, thanks to the shows' creators and writers, he said he’s convinced the show will be of quality.

""It’s not whips and plantations,” he told reporters. “It’s what they’d imagine a modern-day institution of slavery might look like.”

The network did expect some public resistance, he said, but trusted the show's talented writers: David Benioff, D.B. Weiss, Nichelle Tramble Spellman and Malcolm Spellman.

""They’re going to be the difference,"" he said of the writers. ""My hope is that people will judge the actual material as opposed to what it could be, should be, or might be, and they -- and we -- will rise or fall based on the quality of that material.""

The network takes full blame for how the show was announced, Bloys said.

""File this under hindsight is 20/20,"" Bloys continued. ""If I could do it over again, HBO’s mistake -- not the producers’ -- was the idea that we would be able to announce an idea that is so sensitive that requires such care and thought on the part of the producers in a press release was misguided on our part.""

""If I had to do it over again,” he added. “I would’ve rolled it out with the producers on the record so people understood where they were coming from.”

The 2017 National Jamboree, which this year hosted over 40,000 Boy Scouts, volunteers and visitors, according to the Boy Scouts, was a 10-day celebration for participants across the country to meet each other, go through character-building exercises and have outdoor adventures, wrote Surbaugh.

But those “real moments of Scouting” were “overshadowed by the remarks offered by the President of the United States,” he wrote.

“We sincerely regret that politics were inserted into the Scouting program,” he added.

It is a longstanding tradition -- dating back to 1937 -- for the Boy Scouts to invite the sitting president to speak at the jamboree. To date, eight presidents have spoken at the event in person, which typically happens every four years.

When Trump first took the stage on Monday, he claimed he didn’t want to talk politics at all.

""Who the hell wants to speak about politics when I'm in front of the Boy Scouts? Right?"" Trump asked the crowd in West Virginia.

Soon, however, the speech veered into political territory. The speech was the day before the Senate would vote to move forward on the motion to proceed on health care and Trump, who brought former Boy Scouts in his administration on stage with him, gave a warning to Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price, who was standing behind him.

""Dr. Price still lives, the Scout, helping to keep millions of Americans strong and healthy as our secretary of health and human services,"" Trump said. ""By the way, you're going to get the votes?""

“He better get 'em. He better get 'em. Oh, he better. Otherwise, I'll say, 'Tom, you're fired,'” Trump said.

The president also spoke, as he often does, about the night he won the presidency.

“Do you remember that famous night on television, Nov. 8, where they said these dishonest people, where they said there is no path to victory for Donald Trump?” Trump said. “They forgot about the forgotten people. By the way, they're not forgetting about the forgotten people anymore. They're going crazy trying to figure it out but I told them far too late.”

The crowd often cheered and chanted for the president, but viewers at home had more mixed responses, with many taking to the Boy Scouts' official Facebook page to denounce the political nature of the speech.

Surbaugh addressed these concerns in his apology, extending “sincere apologies” to those “offended by the political rhetoric that was inserted into the jamboree,” he wrote.

“It is in no way an endorsement of any person, party or policies. For years, people have called upon us to take a position on political issues, and we have steadfastly remained nonpartisan and refused to comment on political matters,” Surbaugh added.

Asked to respond to the criticism Thursday, incoming White House press secretary Sarah Sanders repeatedly touted the energy of the crowds responding to the president and said nothing about the substance of the president’s remarks.

""I haven't seen the statement from the Boy Scouts. So I can't comment any further than what I saw firsthand, and that was a lot of individuals, roughly 40 to 45,000 as reported, cheering the president on,"" she said."

Bernie Sanders said Monday that while his campaign wants to win in Iowa, the outcome of the caucus will not make or break his campaign.

“Of course we want to win here but if we end up getting two delegates less than Hillary Clinton - why is that the end?” he told reporters from the steps of his campaign bus after making a quick stop to talk to volunteers at his Iowa campaign head quarters in Des Moines. Sanders is neck and neck in the polls with Hillary Clinton in this first caucus state. He said regardless of the result in this first contest, he's in it for the long haul.

“This is a national campaign. We are in to win at the convention,” he continued. “We are taking this all the way.”

According to the Senator, his campaign has hosted over 100 town meetings in Iowa. He told fans Monday morning that as of yesterday over 70,000 people in the state have come to see him speak in person.



As for tonight? Sanders said it is all about voter turnout. “You got a tied ball game. We will win tonight if voter turnout is high. We will struggle tonight if voter turnout is low.”"

But creator Larry David said it's the perfect time for the show to return.

David, 70, took the stage with his co-stars Jeff Garlin, Susie Essman, J.B. Smoove, and executive producer Jeff Schaffer as part of the Television Critics Association summer press tour on Wednesday.

When a reporter asked David why he chose to have the show return this year, he replied: ""Why not?""

""I'm not a misser, so to speak,"" he continued. ""I don't really miss things [or] people that much, but I was missing it, and I was missing these idiots, so I thought yeah, what the hell?""

Season nine of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" is set to premiere on October 1.

The actor also admitted he has a very selfish reason for the show's highly anticipated return.

""And I got tired of people asking me, 'Is the show coming back?' I couldn't face that question anymore,"" David said. ""I wasn't ready to say no, never, and I kept saying, 'Oh, you know, maybe, who knows?' So I thought yeah, I wouldn't have to be asked that anymore.""

“ ” I got tired of people asking me 'Is the show coming back?

Schaffer also shed light on what viewers can expect from season nine of ""Curb,"" which will continue to follow David's neurotic onscreen character of the same name, along with his manager, Jeff, portrayed by Garlin, and their friends.

Schaffer, the show's executive producer, said ""it'll be self-evident"" what David has been up to since the show's been off the air, adding that the series will go to a ""very fun, crazy, strange place.""

It's no secret that David used drama from his own life as inspiration for some of the most awkward moments in season nine.

""The amount of uncomfortable situations he's been in ... it's like we're sitting in the Fort Knox of awkward,"" Schaffer said.

""I was lied to and told that they wanted to do it, which of course they didn't,"" Spencer told the BBC's Radio 4 program about his nephews, William and Harry.

Spencer, 53, placed the blame on the palace courtiers and called it the ""most horrifying half an hour of my life.""

William, 35, and Harry, 32, were just 15 and 12, respectively, when their mother died in a Paris car crash in August 1997.

William, now a father of two young children, and Harry walked behind their mother's coffin as the procession made its way through the streets of London on Sept. 6, 1997. They were accompanied in the procession by their father, Prince Charles, and their grandfather, Prince Philip, in addition to Spencer.

At one point during the procession, Spencer could be seen patting Harry on the back, appearing to give him emotional support.

Harry recently opened up for the first time publicly about what it was like to walk behind his mother's coffin.

""My mother had just died and I had to walk a long way behind her coffin surrounded by thousands of people watching me while millions more did on television,"" Harry told Newsweek magazine in an interview published last month. ""I don't think any child should be asked to do that under any circumstances. I don't think it would happen today.""

Spencer, one of Diana's three siblings, said he is still haunted by her funeral and suffers nightmares from the ""harrowing"" ordeal.

""It was the worst part of the day by a considerable margin, walking behind my sister's body with two boys who were obviously massively grieving their mother,"" Spencer told the BBC. ""It was a sort of bizarre circumstance where we were told you just have to look straight ahead.""

Spencer gathered with Harry and William and other family members last month on Diana's birthday at Spencer and Diana's family home, Althorp House in Northamptonshire, England, to rededicate Diana's grave.

Today, he revealed there have been four attempted break-ins at the estate, where Spencer lives. Diana's grave, which is not open to the public, is located on an island on Oval Lake on the grounds of Althorp House.

William and Harry have organized several events this year to commemorate their mother's life, including commissioning a special display of blooms in Kensington Palace's sunken garden and a statue to be erected on the grounds of the palace.

Kensington Palace has also announced a number of events to mark the 20th anniversary of Diana's death, including a fashion exhibit that opened in February.

William and Harry also spoke out about their mother, who was 36 when she died, in an intimate documentary that aired this week on England's ITV and HBO.

""All I can hear is her laugh in my head and that sort of crazy laugh of where there was just pure happiness shown on her face,"" Harry said in the documentary, ""Diana, Our Mother: Life and Legacy."" ""One of her mottos to me was you know, 'You can be as naughty as you want, just don't get caught.'"""

Trump tweeted this morning that transgender people would not be allowed to serve in the U.S. military ""in any capacity"" -- a decision he said he made after speaking with military generals and experts.

The two women, both of whom are transgender, spoke out in solidarity with the trans community and criticized the president for not showing support for trans servicemen and women.

""There are 15,000 patriotic transgender Americans in the US military fighting for all of us,"" tweeted Jenner, who voted for Trump. ""What happened to your promise to fight for them?""

In June 2016, former Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced that transgender individuals would be able to openly serve in the armed forces. At the time, he made reference to a Rand study estimate indicating that between 1,320 and 6,630 of 1.3 million active duty service members might be transgender.

Last April Jenner told ABC News' Diane Sawyer that she was frustrated by the president's decision in February to rescind Obama-era guidance that directed schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms that match their gender identity. Later that month, Jenner visited the White House.

""He wanted me to come play golf with him,” Jenner told Sawyer before her White House appearance. ""At that time, I thought it was a pretty good idea, but since Title IX, it's not a good idea and so I won't be playing golf with him ... Would I meet with him privately on this issue? Absolutely.""

Meanwhile, Cox claimed in a statement obtained by ABC News that the new policy sends the message to trans Americans everywhere that ""our lives, our safety and our service are less valuable and unwanted in this country.""

PacificCoastNews

""I have heard from [current and former transgender military members] humiliating stories of being misgendered and experiencing various kinds of mistreatment when they are willing to put their lives on the line in ways many of us would never do including our current president,"" the ""Orange Is the New Black"" star said. ""Let's all come together and send the message to trans Americans that despite what this president and administration proclaims that trans lives, safety and service are valuable, that they matter.”

The actress later thanked members of the trans community currently serving in the military.

""I am sorry your 'commander in chief' doesn't value it,"" she added.

Other celebrities have also expressed their opinions about the ban.

Here is a list of possible Priebus replacements being talked about:

White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway: Conway has had some tough days in the White House over the past six months, but by all accounts her stock is rising. Close personally to the president and first lady, Conway was the first woman to serve as campaign manager on a winning presidential campaign. She would be the first woman to serve as chief of staff.

Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg: Currently the chief of staff and executive secretary for the National Security Council, Kellogg already spends a lot of time around the president. He was also an important adviser to the president during the campaign and one of the first senior military officers to endorse Trump. He has earned the trust of a president who likes to be in the company of generals.

Director of the Office of Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney: Mulvaney didn’t have much of a relationship with the president before the inauguration, but he came highly recommended by Vice President Mike Pence to be OMB director. The president has come to rely on him when it comes to dealing Congress and, of course, on budget issues.

Retired Gen. John Kelly: To many in the president’s inner circle, Homeland Security Secretary Kelly is considered the MVP of the Trump Cabinet. Kelly might well be the president’s first choice for chief of staff, but there is a big downside: He also likes him in his current role.

Newt Gingrich: Gingrich has spent a lot of time with the president in recent weeks and has become a close confidant of the Trump family. He is a loyalist from the early campaign days but is not afraid to tell the president when he thinks he is making a mistake. Most recently, Gingrich told Trump he should not fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

Other possibilities being bandied about include Tom Barrack, Corey Lewandowski, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Gary Cohn.

As the president considers changes in the West Wing staff, he is relying more and more on the advice of his most loyal advisers from the campaign. Campaign veterans like Lewandowski and David Bossie have been spending more time around the West Wing. Conway has been playing a more central role, while Gingrich has been spending more time with the president.

On the other hand, the staff that came in from the Republican National Committee -- including Sean Spicer (on his way out), Katie Walsh (already gone) and Priebus (status unclear) -- have been pushed out of the inner circle."

On his last day of work, William covered a night shift.

The Duke of Cambridge, 35, began piloting his first operational missions in July 2015 and has been based at Cambridge Airport as part of a team of specialist doctors, critical care paramedics and pilots providing emergency medical services in the most dire of situations.

William wrote a letter ahead of his last shift in which he expressed his ""profound respect"" for his colleagues.

""We are sent to only one per cent of ambulance call outs, where having a trauma team and getting the hospital to the patient quickly, can mean the difference between life and death,"" William wrote in the letter published by the Eastern Daily Press, a local newspaper. ""I have watched our medical team perform surgery on a patient within minutes of jumping off the helicopter – their level of skill is astounding.""

He continued, ""I have watched as incredibly skilled doctors and paramedics have saved people’s lives. These experiences have instilled in me a profound respect for the men and women who serve in our emergency services, which I hope to continue to champion even as I leave the profession.""

The Duke of Cambridge will complete his last shift as an air ambulance helicopter pilot with the @EastAngliAirAmb this evening. pic.twitter.com/x8mbgNJlZU — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) July 27, 2017

William also opened up in the letter about the mental health aspects of his job with East Anglia.

""I have also been very fortunate to work with an organization which recognizes the stress its staff deals with and puts their welfare as such a high priority,"" he wrote. ""You need to be physically and mentally fit to do this job properly and so we are encouraged to talk through the things we have seen, to share the trauma within the team.""

William, Princess Kate and Prince Harry formed the Heads Together campaign last year to bring attention to the issue of mental health. William and Harry, 32, have also opened up publicly over the past year about coping with grief after the loss of their mother, Princess Diana, in 1997.

William said one of his first rescue efforts left him determined to bring attention to mental health awareness.

""As a team, we travel to some very daunting incidents and we have been though some incredibly tough times together, witnessing some appalling tragedies"" he wrote. ""One of the first call outs I made was to a young man who had taken his own life; it was an incredibly tough day and had a profound effect on all of us, not least in my determination now to draw attention to this issue.""

William and Kate will now focus on royal duties full-time. William's grandfather, Prince Philip, 96, announced his retirement earlier this year, and his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, 91, no longer does long-haul travel.

The end of William's tenure with East Anglia also coincides with plans for Prince George, 4, to attend school in London this fall. George, who had been attending the Westacre Montessori School near the couple's country home, Anmer Hall, will attend Thomas's Battersea School, not far from the family's base at Kensington Palace.

William and Kate valued the normalcy that William's job as an air ambulance pilot and a RAF search and rescue pilot in Wales gave them. It allowed the couple to provide George and his sister, Princess Charlotte, 2, with a life away from the spotlight, splitting their time between London and Norfolk.

Just last weekend, William, Kate, George and Charlotte returned from a royal tour in Germany and Poland.

It was George's third royal tour. His first took place as a toddler in 2014 to Australia and New Zealand, and the couple brought both their children for the first time as a family to Canada last fall.

The children are slowly being introduced to their future life as young royals. On the family's trip to Poland and Germany, Charlotte showed off an adorable curtsy on the red carpet, and both children politely shook the hands of dignitaries."

ABC's ARLETTE SAENZ : In a stunning blow to Democrats, ABC News can project Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. , will win the Arkansas Senate race Tuesday night, based on preliminary exit poll results. Cotton is projected to unseat two-term Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor, the first Senate Democrat to lose their seat this election cycle. This is the second seat Republicans have picked-up Tuesday night.





Pryor’s loss is a major upset to Democrats who were hoping to hold onto the seat and keep Republicans from taking control of the Senate. Pryor comes from a popular political family in the state. His father, David Pryor, represented Arkansas in the U. S. Senate and served as the state’s governor. The family maintains close ties with the Clintons, a connection that prompted former President Bill Clinton to campaign on Pryor’s behalf on multiple occasions.





But Cotton, a one term congressman and former Army Ranger who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, was able to break through Pryor’s deep political connections in the state. Throughout the campaign, Cotton, 37, repeatedly tied Pryor to President Obama, whose favorability has reached an all-time low, and stressed issues related to national security, including how the administration’s is dealing with ISIS, on the campaign trail.

As young North Koreans took to plazas and public spaces across the capital on Thursday to join in mass dancing and other celebrations, The Associated Press asked several university students what they thought of the possibility that another war could break out in their lifetime.

But more animals remain trapped.

Animal welfare charity Four Paws International said it launched the high-risk operation last Friday and coordinated with security experts to evacuate three lions, two tigers, two Asian black bears and two hyenas from the amusement park Aalim al-Sahar, or ""Magic World,"" with permission from the owner, who had fled to the United States five years ago.

Ahu Savan An/Four Paws

After the Syrian civil war began in 2011 and fighting intensified in Aleppo, the zoo's caretakers were forced to abandon its inhabitants, who are locked in their barren cages and unable to escape the conflict around them. The zoo itself has been severely damaged from shelling, and several animals have either died in the crossfire or starved to death, according to Four Paws veterinarian Amir Khalil who led the dangerous mission.

""The ongoing war has taken its toll on the animals. The lack of water, food, and veterinary care has left the animals physically and psychologically traumatized. Several animals were killed by severe bombings. There was no way for them to escape from this deadly trap,” Khalil said.

Ahu Savan An/Four Paws

Aleppo is now under government control. But just last year, Aleppo was the battlefield of a months-long siege as government forces and opposition groups fought for control over the eastern half of the divided city.

Today, portions of the city devastated by the conflict are still far from recovery.

“The ever-deteriorating situation of the animals worried us. With our mission, we want to spread the message that humanity cannot be divided and that these suffering animals deserve to be heard and seen,"" Khalil added. ""Also, wild animals, such as bears and big cats, trapped in desolate enclosures can quickly pose a threat to humans.”

Ahu Savan An/Four Paws

Khalil, along with a team of local veterinarians and security advisers, entered the derelict zoo amid the ongoing conflict and loaded the nine animals into cages on transport trucks. The animals were emaciated, dehydrated, exhausted and traumatized, with some suffering from minor wounds, according to Four Paws.

Khalil and his team then hastened the trucks across the Syria-Turkey border where they met other team members. The animals received basic medical care, water and food during their journey, which has been supported by Turkish animal welfare activists.

Ahu Savan An/Four Paws

After a 24-hour road trip through Turkey, the animals arrived safely at an animal protection center in Karacabey, some 70 miles west of the city of Bursa, according to Four Paws.

""The journey across Turkey was a tiring affair for all of us. Due to the extreme heat, we had to stop every three to four hours to check on the conditions of the animals and provide them with water,” Khalil said. “We are thrilled that we were able to bring the animals safely to their first destination.”

While at their temporary home in Karacabey, the animals will receive medical treatment and comprehensive examinations this week, including blood tests, ultrasounds and eye checkups. Once their conditions improve, each animal will be relocated to a permanent, species-appropriate home in a sanctuary, according to Four Paws.

""For the first time, these animals are receiving thorough medical examinations by experts working with sophisticated equipment,” said Frank Göritz, one of the local veterinarians supporting the Four Paws team.

Ali Atmaca/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images

This is not the first time Khalil, a 52-year-old Egyptian native, has helped animals in conflict or disaster zones. He is specifically trained to do so. He saved animals at Libya’s Tripoli Zoo after the 2011 uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi and rescued animals from Iraq’s Baghdad Zoo after the 2003 U.S. invasion.

In August 2016 he and his rescue team evacuated all 15 remaining animals at the Khan Younis Zoo, dubbed the worst zoo in the world, in the besieged Gaza Strip. After receiving veterinary attention, the animals were transported to sanctuaries in Jordan, South Africa and elsewhere.

In February, Khalil led a rapid response team from Vienna-based Four Paws to rescue the last two surviving animals from the Montazah al-Morour Zoo in Mosul, the site of a brutal struggle since ISIS took over the Iraqi city in 2014.

On July 10, Iraqi authorities declared ""total victory"" over the terrorist group in Mosul.

For the other surviving zoo animals still trapped in Aleppo, Khalil said he is determined to return with his team soon to evacuate them, too.

“We are currently working hard with our partners to get the remaining animals out of the zoo,"" he said. ""We are not giving up on the remaining animals."""

""Thank God. That's all I've gotta say,"" Morgan told a TV critics' meeting Thursday, where he was promoting his new TBS comedy ""The Last O.G.""

In 2014, the former ""30 Rock"" and ""Saturday Night Live"" star suffered severe head trauma when a truck slammed into the back of the limo van he was riding in. Comedian James McNair, his friend and collaborator, was killed.

Morgan said his brush with death had a profound effect on him. That includes the kind of sitcom he's doing. In ""The Last O.G.,"" Morgan plays an ex-con, Tray, who finds the life and the Brooklyn, New York, neighborhood he left behind is gone.

Morgan has surrounded himself with a strong cast, including ""Girls Trip"" breakout star Tiffany Haddish and Cedric the Entertainer. Why didn't he just go with a ""Tracy Morgan Show"" that gave him all the laughs?

""Maybe I'm just a better man since the accident. Maybe I'm just a better man,"" he said. ""It ain't about me. It's bigger than me.""

He indicated the physical effects of the crash may not be entirely in the past, saying people around him on set makes sure he takes regular breaks during the workday.

""The Last O.G."" co-stars Haddish as Tray's ex-girlfriend, Shay, the mother of twins he didn't know he had. In the 15 years he was imprisoned, Shay moved on, marrying a successful man (Ryan Gaul) who is helping raise the children.

Gaul's character is white, and Morgan said the sitcom is deliberately inclusive.

He grew up in an orphanage in Sonoma, California, and received his military training in the French Foreign Legion.

Today, he's fighting with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed group that includes Kurds, Arabs, ethnic Christian groups, Arab Muslim groups, Christian-religious forces and volunteers from around the world in an effort to topple ISIS in Raqqa, Syria, the de facto capital of the terror group's self-declared caliphate.

Christian keeps bullets marked with the names of places where infamous terror attacks perpetrated by ISIS occurred: ""Manchester,"" ""San Bernardino,"" ""Orlando,"" and ""Paris.""

The names of these cities are printed along the sides of the cartridges he keeps in his bag.

ABC News

He arrived in the Middle East in 2008, when he says he was first deployed, and developed friendships with many of the Yazidi and Kurdish people he met there.

After ISIS's rise in 2014, Christian learned that many of his friends were killed by the group, but he insists that his motive for returning to the region isn't simply a matter of enacting revenge.

""This isn’t really a mission of vengeance,"" he told ABC News about his reason for being in Syria, ""but this is more like ... justice, you know?""

The Syrian Democratic Forces have been trained and equipped by the US-led coalition but do not have heavy weapons, tanks or armoured vehicles, things that were key for Iraqi forces to be able to defeat ISIS in Mosul.

Roughly 500 U.S. ground troops also fill out the region, although their presence is frequently shielded from the media's view; temporary forces in the region bring the total up to as many as 1,500.

That makes Christian's presence as an armed U.S. fighter in the region closer to the exception than the rule.

For Western volunteers like Christian who have dedicated themselves to fighting ISIS abroad, their work can sometimes earn them a minor degree of fame, like Brace Belden, a former punk rocker who was profiled in New York magazine after joining Kurdish fighters in Northern Syria and gaining a large following on social media.

The downside of the work, however, is its inherent danger.

David Taylor, a 25-year-old former Marine from Ocala, Florida, who traveled to Syria earlier this year to join a Kurdish militia unit was recently killed there, his father told The Associated Press this week.

Christian, for his part, is well aware of the inherent danger of his volunteer mission.

He says that bombs dropped by remote controlled drones are the biggest threat he currently faces from ISIS, and takes care to position himself in places where they can't get to him easily.

He describes these makeshift weapons as ""an average $200 Amazon drone"" that makes a high-pitched sound. The drones have an explosive attached to them that he says is ""[big] enough to ruin your day.""

Christian told ABC News that he sees hope in the unity of SDF soldiers, and admires the degree to which people of different faiths come together under a common cause through the group.

ABC News

He said that education in the region, coupled with that sense of unity he feels while fighting for the SDF is the key to defeating ISIS long after the physical turf of their so-called caliphate is eventually reclaimed.

""I think the future in not just the Middle East but any conflict zone ... you have to educate the local people,"" he said. ""I can kill 100 terrorists with these bullets, but with one book you can eradicate a whole city’s worth of terrorism.""

337,http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/report-iran-successfully-launches-satellite-carrying-rocket-48881650,go,Iran claims launch of satellite-carrying rocket into space,['Abc News'],"Iran successfully launched its most advanced satellite-carrying rocket into space, the country's state media reported Thursday, in what is likely the most significant step yet for the launch vehicle.

A confirmed launch of the ""Simorgh"" rocket would mark another step forward for the Islamic Republic's young space program, but is likely to raise alarm among its adversaries, who fear the same technology could be used to produce long-range missiles.

The U.S. State Department called the launch ""provocative.""

Iranian state television said the rocket, whose name means ""phoenix"" in Persian, is capable of carrying a satellite weighing 250 kilograms (550 pounds). The report did not elaborate on the rocket's payload. Other state-linked agencies including the semi-official Fars news agency also described the launch as successful.

Media reports did not say when the launch took place at the Imam Khomeini National Space Station in Semnan, some 220 kilometers (138 miles) east of Tehran.

Iran frequently announces technological breakthroughs that are difficult to independently verify. It has carried out multiple tests of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles as well as other domestically produced weapons over the years.

The Simorgh is a two-stage rocket first revealed in 2010. It is larger than an earlier model known as the Safir, or ""ambassador,"" that Iran has used to launch satellites on previous occasions.

The launch comes as the United States has criticized Iran's ballistic missile tests, which American officials argue violate the spirit of the 2015 nuclear deal that Iran struck with world powers. Under the agreement, which does not expressly prohibit missile tests, Iran agreed to limit its uranium enrichment program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. The U.S. said Thursday that such a rocket is inherently designed to be able to carry a nuclear warhead.

Iran has pursued a satellite launch program for years. The U.S. and its allies worry that the same technology could be used to develop long-range missiles.

The country has sent several short-lived satellites into orbit over the past decade, and in 2013 launched a monkey into space. But it recently abandoned plans to potentially send humans into orbit, saying in late May that the cost of doing so was prohibitive.

The U.S. National Air and Space Intelligence Center said in a report released last month that the Simorgh could act as a test bed for developing the technologies needed to produce an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM.

""Tehran's desire to have a strategic counter to the United States could drive it to field an ICBM. Progress in Iran's space program could shorten a pathway to an ICBM because space launch vehicles (SLV) use inherently similar technologies,"" the report said.

Iran's satellite-launch program falls under the responsibility of the defense ministry, which has denied that the space program is a cover for weapons development.

The head of Iran's space agency in October expressed for the first time interest in cooperating with NASA. Iran has offered to share its scientific findings and satellite data with other countries.

Iran's most recent known successful satellite rocket launch was in February 2015, when it put an imaging satellite known as ""Fajr"" into orbit. That launch happened while Iran was negotiating the nuclear deal.

It is believed to have carried out at least a partial test of the Simorgh rocket last year, though the exact details of that attempt were never made public.

Iran's decision to announce the rocket launch now likely serves as a test of America's reaction, said Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior Iran analyst with the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a conservative think tank long critical of the nuclear deal.

Taleblu said the launch announced Thursday had implications not only on Iran's ability to launch satellites, but also in possibly building intercontinental ballistic missiles.

If Iran begins working on heat shields and other technology allowing for a rocket's payload to re-enter Earth's atmosphere, that would be a major warning sign, he said.

""This will take time, but the Iranian ballistic missile, nuclear, and space program shows that slow and steady always wins the race,"" Taleblu said.

Asked about the Iran missile tests, China's U.N. Ambassador Liu Jieyi, the current president of the U.N. Security Council, said that it was not ""within the scope"" of the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers.

""I think what's important is that the agreement continues to be implemented and all the sides make constructive efforts to resolve whatever issues that still exist, and to completely and comprehensively implement the agreement,"" Liu told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York.

""He was in great spirits,"" Pouncey said. ""He was excited. ... Obviously I don't condone any of the things that he was accused of, but just to have a friend I was so close with, that I felt like was my brother and I know that he felt the same way, it's tough.

""It's tough for anyone to have a loss in their family, but that one right there hit me and my brother really hard.""

The Pounceys attended a private funeral for Hernandez. Pouncey said Hernandez's fiancee and daughter spent time with him in South Florida during the offseason.

""They're doing really well,"" Pouncey said.

341,http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/experts-warn-parents-snapchat-hook-teens-streaks/story?id=48778296,go,Experts warn parents how Snapchat can hook in teens with streaks,['Abc News'],"Teens are on their phones more than six-and-a-half hours a day, according to the nonprofit Common Sense Media. More than half of teens text and nearly all use social media apps, and this daily behavior may not be entirely their fault.

Many games and social media apps are designed to get people “hooked” and keep coming back, Dr. Jodi Gold, the author of “Screen Smart Parenting,” explained to ABC News.

Take Snapchat, the super popular app among teens for sharing photos and video, which has mechanisms in place to incentivize teens to become daily users with a phenomenon called the Snapstreak.

Snapchat friends exchange a photo daily for three consecutive days to start a ""streak."" If one day is missed, the streak will expire. The app tracks the streak, upping the number next to the friend's name as the Snapstreak continues.

Experts like Dr. Jodi Gold say streaks can create a concerning hierarchy of friendship that can leave some teens afraid to disappoint others if they drop a streak -- or petrified about any change in status.

""This has become extremely important -- especially to teenagers,"" Gold explained.

It's become so important that 18-year-old friends Sherlana and Ray have a 405-day Snapstreak. That means they’ve been sending each other a photo of something every day for more than a year.

The two are so invested in their streaks that if they can’t get onto the app, they turn to their mothers to send snaps for them.

“When she sees that [hourglass] come on and she can't get onto the WiFi, you know, then she starts to panic,” Sherlana’s mom, Cindy Alphonse, told ABC News.

Snapchat told ABC News that Snapstreaks are ""designed to be light-hearted and fun.""

It's not just apps that suck teens in. Smartphone games like the popular strategy game Clash Royale, which has rocketed to the top of the charts, can be habit-forming.

Gold’s 11-year-old son, Carter Gold, says the game was so addicting for him that he had to delete the app from his phone in order to fully remove himself.

""They always try and pull you in more and then they kind of never let you leave until you finally quit it,"" Carter said.

Supercell, the maker of Clash Royale, told ABC News: ""We want people to enjoy our games when they play them but we make it easy to leave if they don't.""

Gold says the concern is not necessarily how many hours kids log on the apps, but how important they are to the teen’s self-worth.

“The more you cannot leave one day without being on social media, the more your identity gets wrapped up in it [and] the more likely it's going to have negative effects,” she said."
342,https://www.disneybaby.com/blog/cool-baby-names-outside-the-top-1000-baby-names/,go,Cool Baby Names,['Michelle Horton'],"If you check the annual Top Baby Name list as a general What Not To Name My Baby reference — as many modern parents do — then this is the list for you.

You’re looking for a baby name that’s cool and usable, but you’d prefer if your child wasn’t one of many Jessicas/Michaels/Sophias in school — destined to be identified with a last initial. You moan and groan when your favorite formerly unique names (Henry, Penelope, Oliver) creep up into the “popular” zone, and you take your naming seriously.

And so I give you some of the coolest baby names that haven’t hit the Top 1,000…yet:



GIRLS First up, the ladies…

Amalia Meaning: Work A less-popular alternative to Amelia.

Mabel Meaning: Lovable First of all, how about that meaning? Mabel is one of those old-fashioned granny names coming back into fashion — but not fast enough to make it into the Top 1,000. Use it before it starts climbing.

Wren Meaning: A bird A sweet songbird of a name.

Etta Meaning: Estate ruler In a world where Emmas and Ellas abound, Etta is a similar yet jazzier cousin.

Aurelia Meaning: The golden one A more glittering, star-struck cousin to the Disney-inspired Aurora.

Emmeline Meaning: Work There’s something about “Em-“ names that are especially attractive (Emma/Emily/Emilia/Amelia), and Emmeline has the classic femininity without the modern trendiness.

Margot Meaning: Pearl Beyond the attractive meaning, Margot feels both classic and exotic, with a trendy o-ending.

Faye Meaning: Fairy This is an especially cool middle name option, similar to Mae and Rae. It’s also a vintage choice deserving a comeback.

Louisa Meaning: Renowned warrior Another vintage name that’s starting to register on our radar.

Gwen Meaning: White circle It’s not so much “in” anymore, but it’s not so far out that it’s unfashionable. I think Gwen has a classic appeal.

Magnolia Meaning: Flower name Similar to Lily, Daisy, and Iris, Magnolia is an ultra-feminine flower name with a unique spin.

Cordelia Meaning: Heart; Daughter of the sea A sophisticated yet stylish name that’s hanging out just below the Top 1,000 list.

Rosie Meaning: A diminutive of Rose A perkier version of Rose.

Poppy Meaning: Flower name The spunkiest of feminine flower names, which is popular overseas (Poppy is in the UK’s Top 20).

Maisie Meaning: Pearl It sounds like friendly Daisy, but with the attractive nickname option of Mae. And it’s all wrapped up with a vintage vibe.

Delia Meaning: “Born on the island of Delos” A popular nickname for Cordelia (another Outside-the-Top-1,000 pick), Delia has a poetic feel.

Remi Meaning: Oarsman Despite the slightly off-putting meaning, Remi has a modern quirkiness that’s very much in style right now.

Clementine Meaning: Mild, merciful This is a buzzed-about name in the online naming community, but still completely off the nation’s radar. Read: Your friends will think it’s cool, but your parents will give the stink eye.

Florence Meaning: Flourishing, prosperous Florence has all the qualities of a chart-climbing name — vintage, exotic, feminine, and it’s even a place name. Will Florence and the Machine give it a boost up? Maybe, but it currently ranks way down in “unique” territory. So have at it.

Sally Meaning: Princess Well, it means princess; we can start with that. And it’s also a super happy and friendly name — with a trendy mid-century flair.

Elodie Meaning: Marsh flower This one feels like it should be popular, but it’s totally not. So that’s probably exactly what you want in a name.

Maren Meaning: Sea Maren is a unique variation of Mary — so you could easily use it as a more modern namesake.

Astrid Meaning: Divinely beautiful Well she’ll always love the meaning of her name — that’s for certain. The name “Astrid” is pretty popular over in Sweden and Denmark, and it’s heard more frequently in the name-enthusiast community, but your little girl probably won’t have multiple Astrids in her class.

Ellison Meaning: Son of Ellis She might have to go through her life saying “N-no ELLison, not Allison,” but it’s a unique “Elle”/”Ellie” name.

Flora Meaning: Flower Flower names are extremely popular right now, but there are a few attractive options that haven’t fully caught on yet, like Poppy and Iris. Add “Flora” to that list. (Also: the Disney connection, obviously)

BOYS And now the boys…

Grey Meaning: Color name The more formal version of Grayson/Greyson is quickly scooting up the ranks, Grey is an attractive color name that’s hanging just below the Top 1,000 list. It could be an especially awesome middle name choice.

Garrison Meaning: Son of Garret A more modern twist to the outdated Gary, and Garrison also has the trendy feel of a place name and/or surname name.

Taj Meaning: Crown Taj made two brief appearances in the Top 1,000 (1976 and 1998), and it has a cool vibe that consistently leaves it lingering in “unique but usable” territory.

Magnus Meaning: Greatest Magnus exudes power (and maybe a little ego), so it might require a strong personality. But with the right personality — man, it could soar.

Miller Meaning: Grinder of grain It’s still pretty unique, but it has the trendy “surname name” and “occupational name” qualities.

Ford Meaning: Dweller at the ford He might have to live with an association to cars, but it’s becoming a rising surname name.

Thatcher Meaning: Roof thatcher Another occupational-meets-surname name that’s trendy yet unique. It’s also a modern twist on Tyler and Taylor.

Bishop Meaning: Occupation name Perhaps following in Deacon’s path?

Enoch Meaning: Dedicated We all know the extreme popularity of Biblical names (like Noah, Caleb, etc.). And Enoch is a strong Old Testament name deserving of a revival.

Duke Meaning: English rank of nobility Again, it takes the right personality — but it might be right for you.

Judson Meaning: Son of Jordan A hybrid of popular Hudson-Jackson, Judson could provide the right kind of alternative. It also kind of sounds like 80s-favorite “Justin”.

Otis Meaning: Wealthy It’s short and punchy, with a vintage flair and trendy hard “O” sound. This is certainly a cool choice.

Baylor Meaning: “Horse trainer” A modern upgrade to Taylor.

Cortez Meaning: Courteous English and Irish surnames are sprinkled throughout the Top 1,000, but this unique Spanish surname could have the unique flair you’re looking for.

Cormac Meaning: Tree trunk Cormac has never made it onto the US Top 1,000 list, but it’s a traditionally Irish name steeped in Celtic culture.

Keller Meaning: Cellar master A German surname that has the trendy “two-syllable name ending in ‘-er” thing going for it — i.e. Cooper, Asher, Ryder, etc.

Louie Meaning: Renowned warrior A friendlier version of Louis — and it makes the French pronunciation easier to recognize (rather than having to say “It’s Lou-ee, not Lou-iss” ).

Clifford Meaning: “Lives near the ford by the cliff” You’ll have to take the Big Red Dog association into consideration — you know, for kids — but Clifford is starting to come back into fashion.

Boden Meaning: “Hill shaped like a bow” It has the same two-syllable feel as trendy Mason and Owen, but it has a cooler “Bo” nickname.

Clarence Meaning: Bright Clarence just might have enough old-man charm to climb back into the spotlight, a la Henry.

Rocky Meaning: Rest Is the name “Rocky” above the Sylvester Stallone association yet? It has the punchy strength that suggests it’s on its way back.

Ralph Meaning: wolf-counsel Ralph is a name with literary and historical significance — plus a dash of old-man appeal.

Langston Meaning: Tall man’s town Probably most notable for the Langston Hughes association, this could be an unexpectedly cool name choice.

Ulysses Meaning: Wrathful Ulysses is a heavy name to carry, but the right little boy could carry it high.

Both Charlie's parents and his physicians at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London agreed in court today that the 11-month-old baby should spend his last days in a hospice, rather than die at home or in the hospital. But they disagreed over the details on how Charlie, whose rare illness has damaged his brain and rendered him unable to breathe on his own, would spend the last hours of his life in the hospice.

Charlie’s parents had hoped to assemble a medical team who could move him from Great Ormond Street Hospital, where he is being treated, to a hospice and supervise the intensive care the child requires so they could spend several days with their son before taking him off life support. But the doctor who had contacted the family offering to help lacked the proper qualifications. The unnamed doctor was a general practitioner with no intensive care experience and no medical team.

If Charlie's family cannot provide a qualified doctor and team, and reach an agreement with the hospital by Thursday at 12 p.m. local time (7 a.m. ET), the judge presiding over the case has ordered that Charlie to be transported to a hospice by the hospital medical team and have his ventilator removed soon after to let him die naturally. The judge ruled that the exact timeline of these events and the location of the hospice remain private by court order.

Charlie's mother, Connie Yates, delivered an emotional statement in court Monday, announcing the reasons behind her and dad Chris Gard's decision to stop pushing to take their son to the United States for potential experimental treatments to prolong his life. Gard read a similar message outside court.

An assessment in the United Kingdom from an American doctor who specializes in mitochondrial depletion syndrome, the rare disease from which Charlie suffers, said the baby's condition was past the time when such treatments would have helped.

On Tuesday, Charlie's family asked the court for permission to let him die at home."
345,http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/music-reviews-lana-del-rey-inch-nails-foster/story?id=48882139,go,"Music reviews: Lana Del Rey, Nine Inch Nails","['Abc News', 'More Allan']","This week, modern chanteuse Lana Del Rey releases her new album, Nine Inch Nails release a vibrant EP, Foster the People return with a surprisingly fresh record, ska-infused pop-punks Goldfinger return after a nine-year break, the Black Crowes’ Chris Robinson drops his latest album and country band Parmalee release a new, eclectic set.

Lana Del Rey’s “Lust for Life”

***1/2

The first thing that will probably be apparent about Lana Del Rey’s “Lust for Life” is the uncharacteristically bright smile that the singer is showing on the cover. That definitely indicates a shift. While this record still has the same sedated nods to Nancy Sinatra-style balladry, this is a happier-than-usual set, anchored by the lead single, “Love.” That opener sounds kind of like a bizarre cross between a ’50s love ballad, Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’” and Springsteen’s “Hungry Heart.”

Next comes the title track, which pairs the singer with the Weeknd. This is a perfect coupling, since both performers like to sing about getting freaky in various woozy states. This sounds like a modern answer to the girl groups of the ’60s. It does play to some of Del Rey’s most grating aspects, but it works.

As the album progresses, it gets even more focused from the trippy beats of “In My Feelings” and the spacey, “Coachella – Woodstock in My Mind.”

“God Bless America – and All the Beautiful Women in it” has a cool, vaguely Spanish quality in its guitarwork, while Del Rey gets reunited with her “National Anthem” video co-star, A$AP Rocky on “Summer Bummer” and “Groupie Love.”

Toward the end of the record, she has two of the most surprising collaborations: Stevie Nicks on “Beautiful People Beautiful Problems” and Sean Ono Lennon on “Tomorrow Never Came.”

The dream-like “Heroin” has a dangerous romanticism underneath its core, but if you listen to the words, it also (perhaps too subtly) warns of the hazards of the drug.

Throughout the collection, Lana Del Rey is writing a warm mood piece about the darker underbelly hiding beneath the most celebrated parts of California. This is a record about people living secret lives just below all the glamour.

“Lust for Life” provides for an interesting, dense listen. Will it win her new fans? It is hard to tell. She keeps the low-key energy but with her use of melody and lyrics, she shows a bit more optimism than she has on her previous work. Nevertheless, she still continues to be quite a cinematic balladeer.

Focus tracks:

“Coachella – Woodstock in My Mind” This fresh, bright bit of pop-driven trip-hop paints a very vivid picture with its many lyrical details. This is easily one of Del Rey’s best songs to date.

“Love” This is definitely the defining track of the record. Even though she keeps her signature calm, it’s as if this was written because she was sick of people complaining about her dour demeanor. This is her conscious attempt at a populist ballad and it serves her well.

“Beautiful People Beautiful Problems” (Featuring Stevie Nicks) These two singers sound excellent singing together on this ballad. The two harmonize with each other quite effectively.

Nine Inch Nails’ “Add Violence”

****1/2

Trent Reznor’s second EP in seven months, “Add Violence,” continues the thread begun by December’s “Not the Actual Events.” Again, his scoring partner, Atticus Ross, is now a full-fledged member and across these five tracks, Reznor explores a shockingly diverse number of styles.

The opener, “Less Than,” rocks while also recalling the industrial dance-pop that fueled the band’s classic debut, “Pretty Hate Machine."" Time has been very kind to Reznor and over the years he has become a more studied craftsman. In just under 25 minutes, he lays down some impressive groundwork, especially on the nearly 12-minute workout, “The Background World,” which impressively builds itself up before devolving and slowly disintegrating into nothingness. Reznor has constructed a strong through-line across his career.

“This Isn’t the Place,” for instance, sounds like a clearer answer to something that might have been on “The Downward Spiral,” while “The Lovers” feels like free-jazz score exercise in some places, anchored by a dissonant jungle rumble. Using electronics and heavy guitars together, Reznor can still create a sense of menace, but “Add Violence” often finds most of its chaos at its quietest and most unhinged points.

You might find yourself wishing Reznor and Ross would construct a full-length album instead of going the EP route, but “Add Violence” and “Not the Actual Events” stand as sizable enough statements to stand on their own. Reznor just gets more ominous and driven over time. He’s still very much in top form.

Focus tracks:

“Less Than” There’s almost an audible tape hiss on this track, as if Reznor is using vintage equipment to create this track. This song is exactly the kind of track classic NIN fans would want. Reznor can still seethe with the best of his peers.

“The Background World” Sure this takes up roughly half the EP’s length, but it should also probably get a single edit. As it devolves into static, it is almost as if you can wave it goodbye. By the end, it sounds like a record needle scraping an empty turntable. Reznor has always been a fan of such dissonance.

Foster the People’s “Sacred Hearts Club”

****

After hitting a sophomore slump with its last album, “Supermodel,” three years ago, Foster the People returns with a disarmingly confident electro-pop album, “Sacred Hearts Club.” You get the feeling that Mark Foster and company are going after the same sound Fitz & the Tantrums targeted on their last couple releases, only Foster has infinitely more success. This is a catchy, bouncy record, but it isn’t afraid to show some dark edges.

Part of me wants to hear Mike Doughty of Soul Coughing cover “Pay the Man,” while “Loyal Like Sid & Nancy” is a bizarre, truly bewilderingly exciting trip. This is an undeniably compelling club record and it more than lives up to the hype that the band earned from its single “Pumped Up Kicks.” It just takes so many freaky turns that you can’t turn away.

Particularly during the second verse of “Sit Next to Me,” Foster momentarily has a vocal resemblance to Prince, and it takes a really rare amount of talent to make a song like “I Love My Friends,” sound funky and fun instead of cheesy.

The momentary freak-out of “Orange Dream” is just as alluring as it is strange while “Lotus Eater,” the album’s one mighty dose of alt-rock, finds the band wanting to show off an unhinged side. Sure, “Doing It for the Money” sounds as if it was crafted with the radio in mind, but “Sacred Hearts Club” is a daring, risky record with a lot of cool wrinkles. It is a surprisingly fresh party record that will confuse some and astound others. Either way, it is a clear winner and the band’s strongest effort to date. This is definitely an album I didn’t see coming.

Focus tracks:

“SHC” This is a summer dance hit waiting to happen. It has a slickness, but it is both joyous and freshly executed.

“Lotus Eater” This song is an argument for the group’s next album to be much more rock based. It sounds like a volatile breath of fresh air.

“Loyal Like Sid & Nancy” This is wonderfully claustrophobic in sections but it also begs to be blasted over some loud speakers. In comparison to the group’s previous work, this seems like a huge sonic step forward. It could alienate some of the group’s fans, but it is a powerful experiment. Not only is the reference in the title a surprise, but the song also name checks cult indie songsmith Daniel Johnston in its lyrics.

Amazon

Goldfinger’s “The Knife""

***1/2

“The Knife” marks the return of celebrated ska-flavored punks Goldfinger. The band’s last album was 2008’s “Hello Destiny.” Really, it is the return of John Feldmann, the group’s leader who has reformed the band with members of MxPx and Story of the Year. Travis Barker of Blink 182 plays drums on all but one of the tracks, which is fitting because in the years since the last Godfinger release, Feldmann has become an in-demand producer, notably sitting behind the boards on Blink 182’s “California” and 311’s amazing “Mosaic.” Here, Mark Hoppus sings with Feldmann here on “See You Around” and Nick Hexum guests on “Liftoff.”

This might not be a Goldfinger album in the purest sense, but it captures a catchy pop-punk energy that still sounds refreshing, even when Feldmann sings about no longer being in touch on “Am I Deaf” or about dentistry on “Orthodontist Girl.”

“Beacon” has a nice rise that quickly becomes thunderous, and “Who’s Laughing Now” sounds like a call to arms as it quotes “Ring Around the Rosie.”

“Say It Out Loud,” has a Motown stomp of a beat, even if it begins with the lines, “Hate is a strong word / But I don’t want to live my life in fear.” Any way you look at this record, it seems like Feldmann came prepared. “Put the Knife” sounds like a vintage ’90s pop-punk gold. “Get What I Need” is some nostalgic ska-infused rock.

“The Knife” is a record that looks fondly back on the past. He hasn’t lost his cheery demeanor, but perhaps his recent 50th birthday is causing Feldmann to really reassess his life. This isn’t a perfect record, but it does capture its desired sweet spot and should more than please Goldfinger’s fan base. It’s quite an enjoyable record.

Now if only we could get Swedish electro-pop duo the Knife to re-form and call an album “Goldfinger.”

Focus tracks:

“Am I Deaf” This is by far the best song on the record as Feldmann laments, “Sometimes I feel so old. / Yeah / Am I deaf, or am I just a little left / Of what they listen to today?” It’s one of the best songs about realizing that you have fallen out of touch. It deserves to be a hit, thanks to an amazing melody.

“Don’t Let Me Go” (Featuring Taka [One OK Rock]) Not only does this song sound like a sharp radio single; it also recalls the kinds of sounds Feldmann helped 311 explore on “Mosaic."" The horn section also adds a fitting bit of bite.

“See You Around” (Featuring Mark Hoppus) Hoppus and Feldmann sound like brothers singing next to each other and this song should be a must-hear for people who also enjoy Blink 182’s recent work.

Amazon

Chris Robinson Brotherhood’s “Barefoot in the Head”

***1/2

In spite of its heinous title, Chris Robinson Brotherhood’s new album, “Barefoot in the Head,” is much more substantial and focused than last year’s woozy and lost “Anyway You Love, We Know How You Feel,” finding the former Black Crowes singer realigning himself with the groove.

This album goes from upbeat jam-band numbers like “Behold the Seer” to softer and more varied material like “She Shares My Blanket.” Robinson does his best Dylan impression on “Hark, the Herald Hermit Speaks,” which also boasts some excellent organ and piano work. On “Dog Eat Sun,” there is a serene, almost meditative quality to song’s opening riff and overall mood.

“Blue Star Woman” on the other hand is what would happen if Tin Pan Alley met wah-wah blues. “High Is Not the Top” has some catchy banjo and perhaps melodica action, while “Glow” makes some nice use of some slight Indian influences.

This album is at its best when Robinson is allowed to show his funkier side, bringing to mind the Black Crowes’ cover of “Hard to Handle,” but throughout the set, no matter the tempo, he still shows a much stronger attention to song-craft. The awkward haze of “Anyway You Love, We Know How You Feel,” has lifted, making for a much more satisfying record.

On “Good to Know,” he even gets a little playful, bouncing his vocals off of a cheeky, echoing keyboard line. There’s a looseness to this record and an easy-going quality throughout, but it makes sure not to be overtaken in mood this time around. Craft is much more evident.

“Barefoot in the Head” is a very satisfying record that shows that Robinson is once again finding his way, creating something new while paying attention to Southern rock and jam-band traditions.

Focus tracks:

“Hark, the Herald Hermit Speaks” You kind of have to wonder if the Dylan impression here was just done as an of-the-moment experiment or if it was concretely planned. Either way, against the odds, it really works, giving the track a classic sensibility. The band is also in top form here.

“Behold the Seer” This is a really groovy exercise, anchored by some wah-wah keyboard work. But it also plays to Robinson’s most soulful side.

“Glow” On the softer second half, this ballad is a definite highlight. It’s also mixed well, giving each instrument room to breathe. When the flute comes in, it is a nice touch.

Parmalee’s “27861”

***

Country band Parmalee’s sixth effort, “27861,” is a sonically varied collection that works with as many pop conventions as it does country. While “American Nights” is the kind of song that seems to be on every mainstream country record these days, with lyrics that could have been penned in a boardroom in order to pinpoint demographics, much of the rest of the record takes some unexpected turns.

The opener and main single, “Sunday Morning,” has a wide appeal and a big chorus about the redemptive quality of love. Elsewhere, “Heartbreaker” has a palpable brand of funkiness that with the exception of the bit of twang in lead singer Matt Thomas’ voice, isn’t very country sounding at all. It’s a groovy pop song with some possible crossover appeal.

“Like a Photograph” has similar pop appeal with its how-could-you-like-him-instead-of-me? brand of storytelling.

When the relaxed ode to Sunday morning “Mimosas” comes around, you can’t help but laugh. The song touts the cocktail as a hangover cure, and it is delivered in such an effortless, breezy way that it will probably win over even the most skeptical of listeners.

“Hotdamalama” mixes hard-rock and hip-hop swagger into the formula, somewhat awkwardly, but even when this band kind of stumbles or reverts to stereotypical tropes, there’s still a likable core underneath that keeps everything grounded. “A Guy Meets a Girl” is about two unsuspecting bar patrons finding love, while listening to a bar-band cover the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ “Californication.”

“Savannah” is an ace ballad, and “Drink It Off” has surprising power. This is more of a pop record than a country offering and yet you can imagine “Barrel of a Shot Glass” being a country radio hit. Sure, there are a lot of songs about drinking, but a lot of these songs are decently written and well executed.

“Roots” hits the hammer a little too hard on the head especially with the line about not including the ""g"" in “huntin’ or fishin’,” but its point is clear, and the song ends up soaring quite nicely.

“27861” is a good record that shows a dynamic act. When it takes the easy way, it still does so with care, indicating that this is a band capable of handling more substantial material.

Focus tracks:

“Sunday Morning” Love as religion is a common theme, but this soaring anthem earns its place as Matt Thomas sings, “When I’m lost on a Saturday night / Baby, you save me / Just like Sunday morning.”

“Drink It Off” This is a song about drinking to forget your problems. It’s nothing new, but it is an impeccably-constructed pop song with a strong melody that might make you want to press the repeat button.

“Mimosas” Yes, this song is hilariously unexpected and wonderfully chilled.

346,http://abcnews.go.com/US/man-killed-wife-aboard-cruise-ship-stop-laughing/story?id=48883288,go,Man says he killed wife aboard cruise ship because 'she would not stop laughing at me': Affidavit,"['Abc News', 'Morgan Winsor', 'Julia Jacobo', 'More Alex', 'More Morgan', 'More Julia']","A man was charged today with killing his wife aboard a Princess Cruises ship in Alaska, according to federal court documents.

Kenneth Manzanares has been detained and faces murder charges in the death of his 39-year-old wife, who is identified by the initials K.M., according to a criminal complaint filed today in federal court by the FBI. A source with knowledge of the FBI's investigation told ABC News that the victim was Kristy Manzanares of Utah.

Princess Cruises said a domestic dispute occurred Tuesday night and resulted in the woman's death. The FBI said that it is investigating the ""suspicious"" death and that it dispatched teams from Anchorage and Seattle to Juneau and Utah to speak with the deceased's family. The agency has jurisdiction in this case, it said, because the death happened on the water.

The incident occurred while the cruise was traveling from Ketchikan to Juneau, acting U.S. Attorney for Alaska Bryan Schroder said in a press conference Thursday afternoon.

According to an affidavit by FBI Special Agent Michael Watson, security and medical personnel ""responded to an incident"" in the cabin occupied by the Manzanareses aboard the Emerald Princess on Tuesday just after 9 p.m. local time, when the ship was seven miles off the coast of Forrester Island.

She was found with a severe head wound, and blood was spattered throughout the cabin, according to the court documents. She was pronounced dead at approximately 9:20 p.m. local time, the court documents state.

The FBI was then notified of the incident at 11 p.m., an agency spokesperson said in a press conference Thursday.

An Emerald Princess security officer told investigators he noticed blood on Kenneth Manzanares' hands and clothing at the time. According to the affidavit, the officer placed the man in handcuffs and detained him in an adjoining cabin.

The security officer told investigators that other witnesses entered the cabin earlier and also saw blood on man's hands and clothing. According to the affidavit, one witness, identified by the initials D.H., said that he saw the woman lying on the floor covered in blood and that when he asked Kenneth Manzanares what had happened, he replied, ""She would not stop laughing at me.""

Schroder said that comment was made after the witness had entered the room. Neither he nor the FBI would comment on whether there was a witness in the room at the time of the incident.

Other family members were onboard the ship at the time, the FBI spokesperson said.

The witness said he then saw Kenneth Manzanares grab the woman's body and drag her toward the cabin's balcony. The witness told investigators he grabbed the woman's ankles and pulled her back into the cabin. According to the affidavit, Emerald Princess security officers entered the cabin soon afterward.

""Later, when Manzanares was being processed during a search by the FBI for physical evidence, he spontaneously stated, 'My life is over,'"" Watson stated in his affidavit, adding that he had probable cause to believe Kenneth Manzanares committed murder.

Kenneth Manzanares is due in court at 2 p.m. local time today.

The FBI spokesperson described the crime scene as fairly small and said 15 agents interviewed about 200 passengers and crew members following the incident.

Schroder would not comment on the condition of the remaining members of the family who were onboard the ship.

The Emerald Princess was on a seven-day round-trip cruise that departed Seattle on Sunday, according to the cruise line.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and all those impacted by this tragic event,"" Princess Cruises said in a statement.

Passengers told ABC News they were allowed to disembark in Juneau, Alaska's remote capital, on Wednesday around 8:30 p.m. local time after authorities lifted an hourslong lockdown.

Princess Cruises later confirmed that the ship departed Juneau for Skagway on Wednesday at 11:15 p.m. local time. The ship, carrying 3,400 passengers and 1,100 crew members, was scheduled to take a scenic tour around the Tracy Arm fjord near Juneau today, but that was canceled.

""Guests who had shore excursions booked for Tracy Arm fjord will have their shipboard folio credited automatically, and prepaid shore excursions will be refunded. Additionally, in light of the impact on guests' cruise vacations, Princess Cruises has issued each guest a $150 onboard credit,"" the cruise line said in a statement Thursday.

A passenger told ABC News that the ship arrived in Skagway on Thursday and passengers were told the rest of their trip should be unaffected."

The €209 million-euro ($243 million) package includes a 151 million-euro program to help refugee families rent accommodation in Greek cities and provide them with money in an effort to help them move out of refugee camps, EU officials said during a visit to Athens.

The Commission said the new funding more than doubles the emergency support extended to Greece for the refugee crisis, bringing it to a total of 401 million euros. The rental project is in cooperation with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and will provide 22,000 rental places with the aim of increasing the number of refugees living in rented apartments to 30,000 by the end of the year, including 2,000 places on Greek islands.

A parallel scheme worth 57.6 million euros will provide refugees and asylum seekers with monthly cash stipends distributed through cash-cards for expenses such as transport, food and medication.

""The projects launched today are one part of our wider support to the country but also to those in need of our protection,"" said Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos. ""Around 1.3 billion euros of EU funds are at the disposal of Greece for the management of the migration crisis."""

""In the past, for reasons I try to explain, I've often felt I had to be careful in public, like I was up on a wire without a net,"" Clinton writes in the introduction, according to publisher Simon & Schuster. ""Now I'm letting my guard down.""

Simon & Schuster told The Associated Press on Thursday that Clinton's book will be a highly personal work that also is a ""cautionary tale"" about Russian interference in last year's election and its threat to democracy. In public remarks since last fall, the Democrat has cited Russia as a factor in her defeat to her Republican opponent, along with a letter sent by then-FBI Director James Comey less than two weeks before the election.

Comey's letter, sent to Congress on Oct. 28, said the FBI ""learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation"" into the private email server that Clinton used as secretary of state. Days later, Comey wrote that the FBI did not find anything new.

""Now free from the constraints of running, Hillary takes you inside the intense personal experience of becoming the first woman nominated for president by a major party in an election marked by rage, sexism, exhilarating highs and infuriating lows, stranger-than-fiction twists, Russian interference, and an opponent who broke all the rules,"" according to Simon & Schuster. ""In these pages, she describes what it was like to run against Donald Trump, the mistakes she made, how she has coped with a shocking and devastating loss, and how she found the strength to pick herself back up afterwards.""

""What Happened"" is scheduled to come out Sept. 12 and has evolved since first announced, in February. It was originally billed as a book of essays that would ""tell stories from her life, up to and including her experiences in the 2016 presidential campaign,"" as opposed to a memoir centered on the race. Clinton's loss has already been the subject of the best-selling ""Shattered,"" a highly critical book by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, and a more sympathetic account, Susan Bordo's ""The Destruction of Hillary Clinton.""

Within hours of Thursday's announcement, ""What Happened"" had jumped from No. 3,350 to No. 17 on Amazon.com.

Clinton's previous works include the 2003 memoir ""Living History,"" published while she was a U.S. senator from New York, and a book about her years as secretary of state, ""Hard Choices,"" which came out in 2014 as she prepared to launch her presidential candidacy. She also wrote ""It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us"" when she was first lady.

Her upcoming memoir isn't the first political book to be called ""What Happened."" Scott McClellan, a former White House press secretary during the George W. Bush administration, released a book with the same title in 2008. McClellan's memoir was an unexpectedly critical take on his former boss that became a best-seller."

It traveled directly across toward the other hip in what we call a trans pelvic gunshot wound. The round fragmented and did substantial damage to bones, internal organs and blood vessels.

""I understand he was awake on scene but by the time he was transported by helicopter to the MedStar trauma center, he was in shock,"" Sava said. ""When he arrived, he was in critical condition with an imminent risk of death."" His condition later improved.

CANDIDATES PLAY FOR SIDEBAR STATUS



ABC’s RICK KLEIN: The most common refrain among campaign operatives in advance of the debate: Does it really have to be about Trump?

The truth is that it does, and they know that it does. To the extent that these are predictable affairs, it’s reasonable to expect a feistier debate, not so much about Trump as it is about who will stand up to Trump.

But another intriguing storyline with be the candidate who plays for the sidebar. Several aides to rival campaigns have cited Ben Carson’s surprise breakout in the last debate as a template – and evidence that you can “win” even a debate in this environment without just mixing it up with Trump.

One aide to a campaign with this longer-game strategy laughed when I asked about campaign strategy, pointing out that these are dynamic and hard-to-game-plan events: “Everyone watches too many ‘West Wing’ reruns!”

“He's recently come to join the Republican Party and he's trying to come to join as a conservative but I think there's a great deal of evidence pointing in the opposite direction that he's really not a conservative and so I think we will have that debate,” said Paul, who has repeatedly called Trump a fake conservative. Paul went on to argue, ""Ultimately the issues will be a problem for Trump when people get beyond the celebrity. I do think that his attack on Fiorina probably started to wake people up. I think Governor Perry leaving the race started to wake people up that my goodness, a governor of a large Republican state is leaving, but we're keeping a reality TV Star who really shows no evidence of really being serious about anything."" The Kentucky Senator was asked about Gov. Chris Christie, who he fought with during the first Republican debate. ""We're all in and I'm ready for combat,” Paul answered.

HOW HILLARY CLINTON’S CAMPAIGN IS SPENDING DEBATE NIGHT ABC’s LIZ KREUTZ reports: Meanwhile, what’s Hillary Clinton's campaign up to tonight?

Hosting house parties!

The Clinton campaign has organized over 100 “Women for Hillary” GOP debate-night watch parties in roughly 20 cities across the country for women supporters a and volunteers to watch the debate. According to the campaign, “while the Republican candidates bend over backwards to offer extreme, out-of-touch and out-of-date positions, women supporters will discuss Hillary’s record as a champion of women and girls.” In addition, the campaign has launched a Pinterest page — “Organizing 101: House Parties for Hillary” — with instructions on how you (aka “everyday Americans”) can host one, too. Here are some of the cities hosting a ""Hillary for America"" GOP Debate Watch Party tonight: Boca Raton, FL Austin, TX Charleston, SC Minneapolis, MN Washington, D.C. Chicago, IL Denver, CO Kansas City, MO Biloxi, MS Memphis, TN Vienna, WV Columbia, SC Chantilly, VA Detroit, MI Lubbock, TX Portland, OR Tuscaloosa, AL Myrtle Beach, SC Bailey, CO





SCOTT WALKER’S DEBATE DAY DISCOUNT

ABC’s MEREDITH MCGRAW: Is Scott Walker’s campaign holding a going out of business sale?





That’s what Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Holly Shulman asked on Twitter today after the Walker campaign advertised 40 percent off all merchandise in its online store for one day only.

Among the items for sale: Red, white and blue bumper stickers (two for $10), limited edition signed rally placards ($75), and “Walker for President” embroidered fleece pullovers that retail for $65.00. As the website notes, “All proceeds are invested in our campaign to elect Scott Walker for President in 2016.” Walker had been riding high in the polls both nationally and in Iowa, but as Donald Trump took more of the spotlight this summer, Walker’s support has crumpled. Recent national polls put him in the low single digits. Tonight, Walker takes the stage at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in an effort to win back some of that early support. But Walker, who is viewed as the Midwestern foil to Trump’s gilded, showy style, isn’t closing shop yet. Despite canceling campaign events in Michigan and California next week, he will continue to campaign throughout Iowa and South Carolina. And Walker’s campaign isn’t the only trying to move some merchandise in honor of tonight’s debate. Ted Cruz is offering his supporters 20 percent off items in his campaign store like camo print hats.

ABC's RICK KLEIN: He’s been an entrepreneur and an entertainer, a provocateur and, most recently, a politician.

Now comes Donald J. Trump, angry savior. In wrapping up a convention that was unmistakably his, delivering an extra-long speech very much in his own staccato, Trump combined elements of all of his former careers to try the role of a lifetime -- ready to fix a country he believes to be deeply broken, and that he believes he is uniquely suited to mend.

“Nobody knows the system better than me -- which is why I alone can fix it,” Trump said in his acceptance speech.

Trump, with the help of his daughter on Thursday, may or may not have saved his own convention, after the campaign’s self-imposed distractions and a hostile takeover attempt by a scorned rival. That media-ready candy replaced the meager policy vegetables offered up by speakers earlier in the week -– sideshows that were novel yet somehow predictable at Trump convention.

But whether Trump succeeds more broadly in the election will depend on grim calculations: that voters see the country as broken and beaten, and that they will reject Trump’s rival as corrupt, criminal, or worse.

Those twin themes are apparent in the way Trump has rewritten a Hillary Clinton campaign slogan -– “I’m with her” -– for his own purposes.

“My pledge reads: ‘I’m with you – the American people,’” Trump said.

Trump’s speech was a gloomy exclamation point on a run-on sentence of a convention. After the first three days meandered through major themes, Trump on Thursday marched through a parade of horribles: poverty, crime, terrorism, illegal immigration, trade, unemployment, war and Hillary Clinton.

“This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness,” he said.

Trump’s answer includes, prominently, a promise of “law and order.” At one point, when the crowd starting chanting, “Lock her up,” Trump responded with what counts as restraint for him: “Let's defeat her in November.""

Trump used his family to offer the uplift that his speech, and much of his convention, lacked.

offered powerful personal testimony to her father, humanizing him while connecting biography to policy –- just not the policies that Trump is best known for endorsing.

“He will fight for equal pay for equal work and I will fight for this too, right alongside of him,” she said. “Politicians ask to be judged by their promises, not their results. I ask you to judge my father by his results.”

Like her father, Ivanka Trump underscored qualifications she views as making him unique.

“In ways no one expected, this moment in the life of our country has defined a mission, and given it to an extraordinary man,” she said.

Her dad wouldn’t disagree. Eight years ago, the next president was ushered into office on the strength of “yes we can.” After a year of campaigning and winning, Trump is replacing that with the first person singular.

“People who work hard but no longer have a voice –- I am your voice,” he said.

Trump is making a calculation, but it’s not a blind one. Trump’s voice has gotten louder because of what he senses in the country he’s traveled.

Inside the broad of statements Trump made -- “Safety will be restored,” “Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo,” “I am the law and order candidate” -- is a deep sense of anxiety that Trump is recognizing and amplifying during his remarkable campaign for the White House.

“America is back,” Trump thundered, well more than an hour into his speech. “History is watching us now. We don’t have much time, but history is watching.”

The balloons fell, the Trumps were joined by the Pences, and the campaign music blared the Rolling Stones: “You Can’t Always Get What You Want.” http://abcn.ws/2azBaSA"

""I serve at the pleasure of the president. I've understood that from the day I took the job,"" Sessions told The Associated Press during a trip to El Salvador today.

He also acknowledged that it has not been the ""best week"" for him in light of Trump's near-daily insults.

In spite of the barbs, Sessions told the AP that he and the president have a ""harmony of values and beliefs.""

Over the course of the past four days, Trump called Sessions ""beleaguered"" in a tweet, slammed him for taking ""a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes,"" said that he was ""disappointed"" with Sessions during a joint press conference with a visiting head of state, and questioned via tweet why Sessions didn't replace the acting FBI director.

Trump's first shot across the bow came during a New York Times interview on July 19, 2017, when he said Sessions should never have recused himself from the investigations into any campaigns and their interactions with Russia. Trump said that if he knew Sessions was going to recuse himself, he would have picked someone else for the job."
361,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/analysis-trumps-transgender-military-ban-coming/story?id=48869839,go,ANALYSIS: No one saw Trump's transgender military ban coming,"['Abc News', 'More Justin']","It's hard to overstate the enormity of President Donald Trump's decision today to ban transgender people from military service.

Not only does it deal a lasting blow to President Barack Obama's legacy of reversing discrimination within the Armed Forces, but it raises so many questions about how and why Trump chose to do this.

For instance: By all accounts, this announcement took everyone in Washington, D.C., by surprise. Neither the Pentagon nor the White House communications staff nor Congress were in any way prepared to answer questions about this. They clearly did not see it coming.

Last anyone heard about the issue was on June 30, when Defense Secretary James Mattis announced he was still reviewing the Obama-era policy that allowed transgender people to join the military (about a year ago Obama's defense secretary said no longer would the military treat ""gender dysphoria"" as a medical condition that precluded individuals from service). Mattis said then that he was giving his people until December to produce a report on the matter. There is no indication Trump had that review before he tweeted out his announcement this morning.

We also know there was a debate earlier this month in Congress about an amendment that would make it illegal for the military to pay for gender reassignment surgery. That amendment, thanks to many Republicans, failed. But that amendment wasn't a call to ban all transgender persons, it just maintained that the military shouldn't pay for related surgeries.

However, unless and until the White House or the Pentagon clarify -- which so far they haven't -- there is no other way to interpret Trump's statement today other than an absolute ban on transgender service.

Here's what he tweeted in full:

After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow...... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017

....Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming..... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017

....victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017

So does that mean all transgender people serving today will be discharged? Incoming White House press secretary Sarah Sanders had no idea when ABC News asked today. She punted to the Defense Department. The Defense Department then kicked the question back to the White House.

Translation: Nobody saw this coming and they don't know what to say.

Sanders said Trump made the decision after consulting with his national security team and said that it was based on issues of ""military readiness"" and concerns about ""unit cohesion.""

Readiness likely means they're worried about costs and unit cohesion means they think transgender persons could be a distraction in the battlefield. These were the same buzzwords used when some lobbied against the repeal of ""Don't ask, don't tell.""

Trump mentioned costs in his series of tweets as well, saying the military would be ""burdened.""

Yet the Rand Corporation, a reputable think tank that has for decades been providing research and analysis to the Defense Department, estimated in June that the total annual costs for the active duty would be between $2.4 to 8.4 million, or between .04 and .13 percent of active duty health care costs.

So that's probably not where he's getting his numbers. Family Research Council, a conservative Christian lobbying group, came up with different numbers. It called the Rand study faulty and says the medical costs plus the lost time for personnel in the field could cost taxpayers between $1.9 and $3.7 billion over 10 years.

Costs aside, polling shows by and large that Americans favor equal protection for transgender people.

According to a Public Religion Institute poll released in March 2017, 53 percent of Americans oppose laws that require transgender individuals to use bathrooms that correspond their sex at birth. A CNN/ORC poll from 2016 shows 75 percent of Americans favor laws that guarantee equal protection in housing and public accommodations for transgender people.

In any case, a policy like this can't be enforced via tweet. The commander-in-chief will have to take some other action, perhaps via executive order, to put any changes into effect. And for now, it's not clear when or how that will occur."
362,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rod-rosenstein-deputy-attorney-general-sessions/story?id=48845480,go,Rod Rosenstein: What to know about the deputy attorney general under Sessions,['Abc News'],"President Donald Trump’s recent spate of criticism of Attorney General Jeff Sessions has led to speculation that Sessions could resign, thrusting his second-in-command into the spotlight.

Confirmed by the Senate 94-6 with wide bipartisan support, Rod Rosenstein, 52, was sworn in as the 37th deputy attorney general on April 26.

A Philadelphia native, Rosenstein went to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, also the president’s alma mater, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in economics. The former prosecutor then earned a J.D. at Harvard Law School in 1989. After graduating, he went to work as a law clerk with Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

Rosenstein has predominantly held public positions in his tenure.

Following his stint as a trial attorney with the Justice Department handling political corruption cases, Rosenstein served as counsel to the deputy attorney general from 1993 to 1994 and associate independent counsel from 1995 to 1997 during the Clinton administration.

He was later tapped to join the team of prosecutors working under Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel on the Whitewater investigation into then-President Bill Clinton and first lady Hillary Clinton’s real estate investment dealings.

In 2005, President George W. Bush nominated him to be Maryland’s U.S. attorney. Rosenstein stayed in that position for 12 years. He was the only U.S. attorney appointed by Bush who was asked to stay on by President Barack Obama throughout his eight-year term.

Rosenstein's relationship with Trump

In Rosenstein's short time in his role as deputy attorney general, his relationship with the president has been hot and cold.

Rosenstein is perhaps best known as the man behind the memo that Trump initially cited as the reason why he fired FBI Director James Comey in May. Rosenstein sent a memorandum to Trump before the firing, noting that Comey’s public statements and his handling of the FBI's investigation in Hillary Clinton's email server had “damaged public confidence in the bureau and department.”

Following Comey's firing, Trump spoke highly of Rosenstein. ""He's ... respected -- very good guy, very smart guy. The Democrats like him. The Republicans like him,” Trump said on May 11, in an interview with NBC’s Lester Holt. (However, Trump later said he would have fired Comey regardless of Rosenstein's memo.)

Shortly after that interview, though, Rosenstein, in his capacity as acting attorney general in campaign-related investigations following Sessions' recusal in March, named Robert Mueller as special counsel to oversee the probe into Russia's election meddling and possible ties to the Trump campaign.

Aaron Bernstein/Reuters

Since then, Trump has begun questioning Rosenstein’s allegiance to his role, particularly after the deputy attorney general appeared before the Senate Appropriations Committee on June 13 and said he didn’t have a “good cause” to potentially fire Mueller and warned if there wasn’t a good cause, “it wouldn’t matter to [him] what anybody [said].”

The appearance came just it was reported that Trump was “weighing the option” of terminating Mueller because he felt Mueller was “conflicted” from representing some Trump family members in the days before his special counsel role. Because of Sessions' recusal, the power to dismiss Mueller lies with Rosenstein.

Trump tweeted out an angry response to Rosenstein's Senate speech on needing ""good cause"" to fire Mueller three days later, calling the investigation a ""witch hunt.""

I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 16, 2017

Rosenstein also came under fire in the June hearing for not providing a clear answer as to whether he could become a potential witness in the Russia investigation. Rosenstein said he wouldn’t answer “hypothetical questions,” but sources close to him told ABC News he met with Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand to discuss the possibility of him recusing himself that week.

Then, on June 19, then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer reiterated the president’s support of Rosenstein, saying Trump has “confidence of everyone” in his administration and that Rosenstein “serves in this administration.”

But a month later, in an interview with The New York Times, Trump jabbed Rosenstein once more for appointing Mueller and discounted him as simply a “second man” that Sessions “hardly knew” when he brought him in.

National Weather Service meteorologist Chris Bowman says widespread flooding was reported after 4 to 7 inches (10 to 18 centimeters) fell over a few hours starting late Wednesday in east-central Kansas and west-central Missouri.

Kansas City Fire Chief Paul Berardi urged motorists in a tweet not to drive into high water, saying his department was responding to calls seeking assistance in areas of flash flooding.

In south Kansas City, Chris Darby and his business partner had scrambled to their Coach's Bar & Grill early Thursday to check for possible flooding and save paperwork when Indian Creek floodwaters inundated the restaurant, trapping them.

The two sought higher ground on the bar and later on equipment before ultimately being rescued by firefighters — only after Darby says he began sending out goodbye texts to his family.

""It's the most scared I've ever been,"" Darby said by telephone while awaiting the rescue. ""We regret the Fire Department has to risk lives to save us.""

In Kansas, a stretch of Interstate 35 was closed Thursday. The Missouri Department of Transportation says stretches of Missouri 2 and 23 in Johnson County and Missouri 79 in Pike County are closed.

Several flood warnings also have been issued for rivers and streams downstream from the deluge."

Lindsey Graham warns of 'holy hell to pay' if Trump fires Sessions,['Abc News'],"Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham today warned that there would be ""holy hell to pay"" if President Donald Trump fires Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

""This effort to basically marginalize and humiliate the attorney general is not going over well in the Senate,"" Graham told reporters today. ""I don't think it's going over well in the conservative world ... If Jeff Sessions is fired, there will be holy hell to pay.""

He added, ""Any effort to go after [special counsel Robert] Mueller could be the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency, unless Mueller did something wrong.""

Graham, a Senate Judiciary Committee member from South Carolina, stressed that there would be no confirmation hearing for a new attorney general in 2017 and that Trump should respect Sessions as a person who ""deserves better.""

He echoed Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who subtly critiqued Trump on Twitter on Wednesday evening, saying the Judiciary Committee is focusing for the rest of the year on judicial and sub-Cabinet nominees and would not consider an attorney general nominee.

Everybody in D.C. Shld b warned that the agenda for the judiciary Comm is set for rest of 2017. Judges first subcabinet 2nd / AG no way — ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) July 27, 2017

Senators such as Graham and Grassley have backed Sessions as Trump jabbed him this week for being ""weak"" on the Hillary Clinton email investigation and for not firing acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who was closely tied to now-former FBI Director James Comey.

Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told ABC News on Wednesday, ""Well, I'm a little bit surprised at some of the reported comments. Jeff has been very loyal to the president, and I think that he deserves loyalty back ... so I hope that that will be reciprocated.""

The Trump-Sessions tension ratcheted up July 19, when the president told The New York Times that he was disappointed that Sessions had recused himself from the Department of Justice's Russia investigation, leaving the power to appoint a special counsel to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Rosenstein appointed Mueller, who Trump said in the interview ""should never have been appointed.""

Graham reiterated his support for Mueller's Russia investigation, saying he has no reason to think Mueller is compromised. Graham warned that he will introduce a bill next week that would prevent the special counsel from being fired when ""empaneled to investigate the president"" unless there is judicial review of the firing.

""The idea that the president would fire Mueller or have somebody fire Mueller because he doesn't like Mueller or Mueller is doing something he doesn't like — then we have become Russia,"" Graham said. ""So the red line should never be drawn ... No president can do that.""

Graham added that the ""president is not in the business of drawing red lines when it comes to the law"" and that he hoped Trump would ""calm down"" to work with Congress on Afghanistan, taxes and health care instead.

When Rosenstein appointed Mueller on May 17, Trump took a defensive stance, saying a thorough investigation will confirm ""no collusion"" between his presidential campaign and Russia and that he wanted to ""fight back."" Mueller resigned from the law firm Wilmer Hale, which has among its clients Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner — which Christopher Ruddy, a friend of Trump's, told ""PBS Newshour"" in June the president thought presented ""conflicts.""

But White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Tuesday morning that he asked Trump, ""Why would you fire him?"" and advised against pursuing it.

Bill Browder, an American-born financier who worked extensively in Russia, appeared before the Senate Judiciary committee Thursday. He's emerged as a prominent critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin after the death of his former attorney Sergei Magnitsky.

Magnitsky, who died in a Russian jail after accusing Russian government officials of stealing millions of dollars in a tax fraud scheme, is the namesake of the Magnitsky Act sanctions law against human rights violations passed by Congress.

Browder told the panel he has ""no doubt"" the controversial meeting in Trump Tower in June of 2016 was orchestrated by the Kremlin.

""The interest and the goal in that meeting was to repeal the Magnitsky Act,"" Browder said. ""That's the one thing we can conclude with certainty about what happened in that meeting.""

While emails released by President Trump's eldest son indicate that the meeting was arranged after Trump Jr. was promised compromising information on Hillary Clinton, Veselnitskaya told ABC News she attended the meeting to discuss the Magnitsky Act and Russian adoptions.

Kushner and the White House have both said the meeting was about adoptions.

Browder told senators Thursday that the ban on Americans adopting Russians was ""retaliation"" from Russia after the passage of the Magnitsky Act, and that any conversation about adoptions was tied to sanctions.

""This was a big ask, to go and ask the possible future next president of the United States to repeal a major piece of human rights legislation, they wouldn't have gone in and said please can you repeal this for us without having something to offer in return,"" he said of the meeting.

Democrats and Republicans in attendance Thursday vowed to keep the existing sanctions in place.

""There is no way that Congress would agree to repeal the Magnitsky Act,"" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said.

Browder faced Congress alone Thursday, though the committee had initially invited Manafort and Trump Jr. to appear to discuss their meeting. Both are cooperating with the committee's investigation under threat of subpoena - which Sens. Grassley and Feinstein issued, and later withdrew, for Manafort.

He also testified that opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which funded research for the dossier of unverified allegations against President Trump, also worked separately to lobby against the Magniskty Act."

ABC News ventured into the building in the western suburbs of Raqqa that had been in the hands of ISIS just days before, where there was evidence of drug abuse on the grounds.

The ground of an outdoor area of the home was littered with syringes, vials and packages for Oxycodone. One of the vials had a label for Diazepam, which is typically used to treat anxiety, panic attacks, seizures and muscle spasms.

The drugs possibly indicate that ISIS fighters faced such intense pressure that they felt the need to self-medicate, whether to calm themselves or, perhaps, relieve pain.

Hussein Malla/AP

ISIS fighters in Raqqa and throughout the region are in a struggle to the death against U.S.-led coalition forces and local allies who have provided the boots on the ground to fight street by street against the militants. ISIS is estimated to have lost tens of thousands of fighters and thousands of square miles of land they once controlled in Iraq and Syria, but it will continue to present a significant threat to America, Europe, the Middle East and beyond.

This particular building, which is in relatively fair condition given the war-torn circumstances, seems to have been used by ISIS as a mosque, although apparently not before the terrorist group occupied it.

It bore hallmarks of ISIS occupation, including dark stains on the ground that appear to be blood, windows that had been shot through and a sniper hole.

Graffiti on the walls featured multiple ISIS flags, writing referring to various ISIS brigades, talk of supporting Palestinians and an excerpt of poetry.

Shreds of clothing and a burned propaganda pamphlet were found in another room.

Blocks away from the building, the battle with ISIS continues as the coalition -- made of both U.S.-led and Syrian Democratic Forces fighters -- moves in on Raqqa from all sides and pushes toward the city's center.

Raqqa is the de facto capital of ISIS and holds a particular degree of significance to the terror group because it is the first city ISIS seized in 2014 during its rapid accumulation of ground in 2014."

That amendment, which also contained a provision to delay the implementation of a repeal by two years to allow lawmakers to come up with a replacement system, failed 45-55, with seven Republicans joining their Democratic colleagues in opposition.

The Senate will now continue voting on measures from both parties, with the Republican ones mostly geared toward scrapping individual aspects of Obamacare one by one -- still in pursuit of the goal Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., laid out Wednesday morning.

""Ultimately, we want to get legislation that will finally end the Obamacare status quo through Congress and to the president's desk,"" he said.

The straight repeal-only option was based on 2015 piece of legislation that passed both chambers of Congress but was vetoed by then-President Barack Obama.

Although that language cleared the House and Senate back then, some Senate Republicans acknowledge now that the vote was symbolic. It was used by some at the time to send a message to Obama and to their constituents back home even though they knew it would be vetoed. And before today’s vote, some Republicans said they would not back the repeal-only option this time.

Senate Republicans' first attempt at passing their replacement legislation failed last night, with nine Republicans joining all of the chamber's Democrats to defeat it, 43-57.

That outcome was not a surprise, given that the bill was previously pulled from the Senate floor because of lack of support.

Republicans from several factions of the party stated their objections to it for a variety of reasons, including its proposed cuts to Medicaid, failure to cut premiums sufficiently and failure to repeal Obamacare entirely.

Republican leadership is expected to move through various versions of repeal, including limited repeal options that would scrap only portions of the Affordable Care Act, such as the individual and employer mandates.

After those votes, the full Senate, even Democrats, will be able to offer additional amendments.

That so-called vote-a-rama later this week could open the floodgates for all senators to introduce as many amendments as they want.

That process could last until senators are physically exhausted.

Democrats have said they have hundreds of amendments to offer and are preparing for a marathon."

Towering trees and snow-capped mountains encircle the wild meadow, beckoning visitors to a largely untouched piece of California's Sierra Nevada.

Conservation groups bought the land in Lower Carpenter Valley north of Lake Tahoe and are opening it for tours. It contains rare carnivorous plants and threatened birds and serves as a migration corridor for other species.

Bird songs and the gurgle of a serpentine creek provide the soundtrack in the meadow less than 8 miles from noisy Interstate 80. The ground suddenly turns spongy underfoot as visitors step onto a deep bog that has formed along parts of the valley floor.

""It literally is a secret garden,"" said Kathy Englar, the Truckee Donner Land Trust's development director.

The Lake Tahoe region regularly draws tens of thousands of people to ski, hike and camp, but the piece of land along a creek near Truckee has been kept behind locked gates along a winding dirt road.

The trust and the Nature Conservancy, with other partners, bought more than 2 square miles (5 square kilometers) from the longtime owners for $10.3 million.

The partnership bought 600 acres in mid-July, but that area is so sensitive it will initially be open only for guided visits. It includes about two-thirds of the vast meadow. It acquired about half the property last year, 637 acres known as Crabtree Canyon, that is now open to hiking and mountain biking.

The partners have a contract to buy a final 80-acre parcel.

The sensitive 600-acre site includes ""these incredibly verdant habitat areas with fens, they call them, these seeps and springs,"" said Elliott Wright, senior associate director of philanthropy for the Nature Conservancy.

The delicate wetlands are home to rare native sundew, small carnivorous plants that attract insects to sticky residue on their leaves.

The North Fork of Prosser Creek is fed by snow and lined by willows and once was home to native Lahontan cutthroat trout, a threatened species that could be reintroduced if no natural population has remains.

The willows provide habitat for 40 of the 270 known nesting pairs of willow flycatchers, a small insect-eating bird once was common in the Sierra Nevada, Wright said.

Seasonal caretakers protect the valley's fragile environment and wildlife, while dogs, horses and motorized vehicles are banned. The partners expect to allow daily public access by foot or mountain bike in 2019 after building a parking area, restroom, trails and viewpoints ""that will allow visitors to experience the meadow without tromping through it,"" Englar said.

The valley was initially settled by dairyman William Carpenter and his wife, Julia. It was purchased in the mid-20th century by a group of fishermen, including newspaper publisher James McClatchy, who used it as a private retreat.

Until now, said Englar, ""this was just kind of an area that was undiscovered.""

It was drizzling outside and a woman, carrying a gas can, was walking in the direction of a gas station. Wright said the gas station was maybe half a mile away. He dropped his family off at church and then made his way back to find the woman.

""I said, 'Hey, are you OK? Do you need help?'"" he said. ""She said, 'I ran out of gas' and I felt I had to give her a ride.""

He took her to the gas station, where they filled her gas can up, and then drove her back to her car; all the while the two conversed. He said the woman shared that she was going through some hard times and having financial struggles.

""I was being tugged on the inside again and felt the Lord said, 'Whatever you have in your pocket just give it to her. She needs that,'"" Wright said. ""I gave her the $40 and she cried and I didn't know if I'd ever see her again. But I felt like it was what I was led to do at that point.""

=Wright said he went back to church and told no one of the incident besides his wife.

“ ” I didn't know if I'd ever see her again. But I felt like it was what I was led to do at that point.

Three years later, in Georgia, Chris Wright found himself in the hospital with his mother, Judy Wright, suffering from complications due to Parkinson's disease. When Judy Wright was able to finally leave the hospital, Chris Wright and his family decided to get nursing aides to help at home.

On Judy Wright's first day back home, Chris Wright said his parents called him, saying that they were really taken with one particular aide. The aide had come to the house despite not being scheduled to be there and had taken great care of Judy Wright, Chris Wright's father told him.

""My dad called me after she leaves and said, 'Hey, I got a lady that we need to use because for whatever it is, there's something different about her that I feel better when she's in the house and your mom loves her as well,'"" Chris Wright said. ""And I said, 'Oh, great.' I texted her and set up a time for her and I to meet to talk about the times she can care for her and what we wanted to have done.""

During that first face-to-face meeting, Chris Wright did not recognize the woman in front of him. Her hair was different, he said, and he was wearing a hat. The aide's name was TunDe Hector. Then, during their talk, she relayed to him a story about a man who had helped her years ago in the rain. Chris Wright said his eyes quickly started welling with tears.

""I just looked at her and I said, 'TunDe, that was me.' And we both just start crying. And she said, take your hat off. And so I took my hat off and she said, 'It was you.' And we both, we just cried and had a moment right there,"" Chris Wright said.

Chris Wright said he watched Hector care for his mother with quality, respect and dignity. On July 9, Judy Wright died.

""She was the best mom that I could have ever dreamed of. She loved unconditionally,"" he said. ""Just a loving, gentle, yet powerful woman. That's probably a good way to explain her.""

“ ” We know that God orchestrated this whole thing and wove it together.

The Wright family decided that instead of flowers, they'd ask family and friends to help Hector achieve a goal she had spoken often about while at their home: completing nursing school.

They put up a post on YouCaring with a goal of $1,000. Within 45 minutes, Chris Wright said the goal was surpassed. And, in less than a week, family and friends had not only shared the fundraiser on social media but had also helped raise $8,000.

Chris Wright and his family captured the moment on video when they presented Hector with the check. In tears, she thanked them.

""Lord, have mercy! ... Y'all don't know how worried, I was so worried [about] how I'm going to pay for my school. ... I'm overwhelmed!"" she said.

Chris Wright said family, friends and even strangers have continued to give to the site. So far, more than $20,000 has been raised by 463 donors to help Hector's nursing-school education.

""We know that God orchestrated this whole thing and wove it together. ... We just kept saying, 'There's got to be something good that will come for this.' We just kept praying. ... It's just amazing what's been done,"" he said. ""It's a neat thing. It's helped my wife and I, it's almost like the Lord has used all this to somewhat take some of the sting out of the grief of losing my mom."""

385,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/angelina-jolies-diagnosis-bells-palsy/story?id=48870459,go,Angelina Jolie's new diagnosis: What to know about Bell's palsy,"['Abc News', 'Dr. Nicole Van Groningen']","In a newly released interview with Vanity Fair, actress Angelina Jolie opens up about her struggle with Bell’s palsy, a rare and often mysterious neurologic condition.

The Oscar-winning actress, who split from longtime husband Brad Pitt in late 2016, expressed concern that in caring for her six children post-divorce, she let her own health decline. Jolie reported turning to acupuncture for relief from Bell’s palsy and noted that she has since made a full recovery.

Here's what you need to know about the rare neurologic disease.

What is Bell’s palsy?

Bell’s palsy is a condition that leads to paralysis of the facial nerve, the peripheral nerve responsible for facial movement. Sufferers develop one-sided facial weakness -- generally over a matter of hours or days -- that can result in eyebrow sagging, inability to close the eye and drooping at the corner of the mouth. Other symptoms may include sensitivity to loud noise, ear pain on the side of paralysis and an impaired sense of taste. Because of the physical abnormalities the condition causes, many affected people experience significant psychological distress and restrict their social activities. The condition is relatively rare, affecting only about 40,000 Americans each year.

Are certain people at higher risk?

Pregnancy is the most well-established risk factor. Bell’s palsy occurs three times more frequently in pregnant women than in the general population, particularly in the third trimester and the first week after delivery. People with diabetes also appear to be disproportionately affected by the condition. But when it comes to race and gender, there are no apparent differences in risk.

What causes Bell’s palsy?

The exact cause of Bell’s palsy is unknown. Most scientists believe there is a strong link between Bell’s palsy and viral infections such as influenza, herpes simplex or respiratory tract infections. Conditions that have been associated with Bell’s palsy include high blood pressure, immunodeficiency, sarcoidosis, tumors, Lyme disease and trauma, such as skull fracture or facial injury.

What’s the most common treatment?

The treatment of Bell's palsy may vary based on the severity of symptoms. Bell's palsy generally has an excellent prognosis, and recovery -- even without treatment -- is fairly common. However, sometimes medications and other therapeutic options are necessary. The goals of treatment are to improve facial nerve function, reduce nerve damage and protect the eye. Most common treatment includes prednisone, antiviral agents such as acyclovir -- normally used to treat herpetic infections -- and eye care to prevent corneal drying, abrasion and ulcers.

Other therapies such as facial massage or acupuncture may provide improvement with facial nerve function and pain, albeit to a small degree.

On rare occasions, surgery may be needed to help relieve symptoms.

The Metropolitan Police force said it has officially informed the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, which owns the Grenfell Tower public housing block, and the management group the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Association that they are under suspicion.

The news came in a letter from police sent to residents of the building. The letter said a senior representative of each body will be interviewed about the fire as part of the police investigation.

The police force confirmed to The Associated Press that the letter is genuine, but stressed it does not mean a decision has been made on whether to charge any individual or organization.

Police have said for weeks that their investigation will consider whether anyone should be charged with a crime. The force said Thursday it was ""considering the full range of offences, from corporate manslaughter to regulatory breaches.""

At least 80 people died June 14 when an early morning fire ripped through the west London high-rise. It was the deadliest fire in Britain in more than a century.

Huge investigations by police, fire officials and others are underway to determine how a blaze that started with a refrigerator in one apartment got out of control so quickly in the 24-story building.

Attention has focused the building's new aluminum cladding, installed during a recent renovation, and authorities want answers fast because thousands of other buildings in the country could be affected.

Angry residents want to know how building regulations that were meant to be among the world's best could have failed so catastrophically. Many accuse officials in Kensington and Chelsea, one of London's richest boroughs, of ignoring their safety concerns because the building was home to a largely immigrant and working-class population."

You were here on Easter, when I was just starting to feel your presence in my belly.

You were here when I chased your brother around the house trying to get him dressed.

You were here for at least 20 grocery stores runs, picking up things I was craving because you were here.

You were here for St. Patrick’s Day, when I wondered if we’d give you an Irish name like your older brother.

You were here for so many things. For 10-and-a-half weeks you were here. You were ours.

Although I found out you had left about a week prior to my 12-week ultrasound, you were still there.

You were there when I was sent home that afternoon because there were no spots left on the surgical schedule.

You were there when your daddy left work to meet me in the hospital parking lot after that appointment.

You were there as we held each other and cried together for our lost baby.

You were there as I secretly tossed up a prayer to my grandmother, to hold you and take care of you in heaven until I’d be able to someday.

You were there that night, as I lay in my bed, dreading what was to come the following morning.

You were there as I cried myself to sleep that night, knowing I could feel your tiny lifeless body inside of me.

You were there when your daddy and I went back to the hospital the next morning.

You were there when they wheeled me in the operating room.

Then you weren’t. You were gone. At the advice of my doctors, for my own safety and well-being, and for the fact that my body just didn’t want to let you go on its own, you were taken away from me.

I cried in recovery. I cried for you every night for the next six months. I returned to my everyday life as a mom to your brother, secretly knowing something would always be missing.

It’d take me a long time, and another pregnancy lost not so far along, to put it all into perspective. You may not have been able to come into this world, but you are in fact still here. Although I’ll always wish you could be here with us ... you are a part of me. You are a part of your daddy. You are a part of your older brother. You are a part of your new little brother too.

By all accounts, your little brother is what everyone would call our “rainbow baby.” He is our little blessing, but a rainbow is a beautiful occurrence after a storm. But to me, you were a ray of sunshine. I think that maybe your light was just too bright to be viewed for more than a short period of time. Like when one stares at the sun. It’s beautiful. It’s glorious. But, you cannot look at it for too long or you’ll hurt your eyes.

So, until I am able to look at your beautiful, glorious light again someday, you will remain my angel. I will love you always, my little sunshine."

The White House would not say whether Harvey was fired, but confirmed he will no longer serve as the top Middle East adviser.

A statement says national security adviser H.R. McMaster ""greatly appreciates Derek Harvey's service to his country as a career army officer"" and that ""the administration is working with Colonel Harvey to identify positions in which his background and expertise can be best utilized.""

392,http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/couple-visit-visiting-cracker-barrel-america/story?id=48833962,go,Couple one visit away from visiting every Cracker Barrel in America,"['Abc News', 'More Katie']","Ray and Wilma Yoder of Goshen, Indiana, are on a quest to make Cracker Barrel history.

The couple, married for 60 years, are just one visit away from visiting all 645 Cracker Barrel Old Country Store locations in 44 states across the U.S.

“I’ve not had a bad experience anytime,” Ray Yoder, 80, told ABC News. “I’ve always walked away feeling refreshed.”

Yoder began stopping at Cracker Barrel restaurants in the 1960s as he made his way across the U.S. as an RV driver.

“They were always along the main Interstate so you’d have to have your eyes closed to miss them,” he said of the Cracker Barrel chain, known for its omnipresent locations marked by tall signs that dot highways across the country.

He added, “It’s nice when you’re out there driving that there’s a place that can be so much like home when you’re away from home.”

Wilma Yoder, 81, would join her husband on the cross-country trips and after many years the parents of four children realized they were onto something.

“I didn’t keep much records then because I didn’t ever think we’d do what we do,” Ray Yoder said. “Then we began to take it quite seriously and said, ‘Let’s see if we can do them all.’”

The Yoders kept track of their visits by taking a map from each restaurant and circling where they had been. As technology progressed, they relied on their children to keep them informed of new store openings posted on Cracker Barrel’s website.

Ray Yoder recalled he and his wife once stopped at around 10 Cracker Barrel restaurants in one day on a drive from Orlando to Canada in order to catch up on restaurants along the East Coast.

""We don’t drive in the parking lot and say, 'Now we’re here,'"" he said. ""We go in a spend a little of money. We’re not rich but we’ll buy a coffee to go or a little bit of candy.""

Courtesy Cracker Barrel Old Country Store

As they crossed Cracker Barrel restaurants off their list, the Yoders became Cracker Barrel celebrities. They are treated as VIPs at restaurant openings and get asked for photos when they stop to dine on their favorite meals, meatloaf and blueberry pancakes.

“We’re incredibly proud to be a part of the Yoders’ quest to visit all of our locations, which they began 40 years ago,” Janella Escobar, the chain’s director of corporate communications, told ABC News. “We think of Cracker Barrel as a ‘home away from home’ for our guests, and the Yoders are certainly a part of our family.”

She continued, “Many years ago, we began inviting them to our ribbon cutting ceremonies as we open new locations to help them on their journey. We look forward to seeing them and helping them complete their mission of visiting every Cracker Barrel in the nation!”

The couple plans to visit Portland, Oregon, later this year to eat at the last Cracker Barrel on their list, until the next location opens. Then they will visit that restaurant too.

“For two old people, we’re pretty fast moving,” Ray Yoder said. “We’re still healthy and we enjoy it so we keep doing it.”"

She has served in the Army for 18 years and is currently a staff sergeant based in Fort Lewis, Washington.

King is also transgender.

""I remember thinking to myself, did I just get fired in a tweet?"" King told ABC News’ ""Nightline"" hours after President Donald Trump announced his proposed ban on transgender individuals serving in the military.

She said that it took her a minute to process the news and, since the administration did not give specific guidance on how Trump’s tweets could immediately effect active service members, she went to work as normal.

King said that the confusion and lack of details didn’t change the reaction she received from her peers.

“Immediately what I was told is, 'We have your back and you have our support,'"" she said. ""And I felt better because I knew that camaraderie that I've come to know the last 18 years was still there and that I was still a part of this amazing team.""

King has been deployed to combat zones three times, including twice to Afghanistan. She began her transition to female after returning from the most recent deployment, in January 2015.

“I came back from Afghanistan and I realized after 20 years of carrying around this secret that I was ready to live an authentic life. So I started talking to friends and family and eventually decided that it was time for me to transition,” she said.

“When I came out to my peers, when I came out to my leaders and again when I came out to my subordinates, what I found was people weren't concerned with my gender. What they were concerned with is my history of service and the fact that they knew I could do my job and they wanted to support me as a person,” she said.

King is one of many active service members who are transgender, all of whom could be leaving the military if Trump’s tweet is implemented literally.

A Rand study, commissioned by the Department of Defense, estimates that between 1,320 and 6,630 of the 1.3 million active-duty service members might be transgender.

New York Times

Logan Ireland is also one of those service members.

Ireland, who spoke to Air Force Times after Trump’s tweets, is a transgender man and security forces airman who is married to a transgender woman who serves in the Army.

""We have pilots, we have doctors, we have combat medics, we have security forces members like myself,"" he told Air Force Times. ""We are everywhere in the military, and for our president to not have a military member’s back that is willing to die for him, blows my mind. And it just makes me very motivated today to continue my training.""

A number of military veterans who said they transitioned after leaving active duty have come to the defense of their fellow service members.

ABC News

Alaina Kupec, who said she waited to transition until after leaving active duty, said that ""one of the things that held me back for so long was fear of losing my job.""

Kupec told ABC News' ""Nightline"" that those who are serving openly now have been ""so brave and courageous.""

""Those that are publicly out right now,"" she said. ""They're finally being accepted and then the rug is pulled out underneath them.""

While waiting for answers about how and if the policy is going to be implemented, the possibly thousands of transgender soldiers are carrying on as usual.

""After taking that moment, I came back feeling very resolved and knowing that this, for now, this doesn't change anything for me,"" King told ABC News. ""I'm still a service member and I'm still serving proudly and I will continue to serve for as long as they'll have me.""

For his part, Ireland seemed more adamant in his rejection of a possible ban.

""I would like to see them try to kick me out of my military,"" he told the Air Force Times. ""You are not going to deny me my right to serve my country when I am fully qualified and able and willing to give my life."""
394,http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/french-firefighters-dramatic-var-blaze-48879224,go,French crews tame dramatic wildfire on Mediterranean coast,['Abc News'],"French firefighters have tamed one of the fiercest blazes to break out during four days of wildfires in the country's southeast Mediterranean coast that led to the evacuation of more than 12,000 people.

The fire in the seaside town of Bormes-Les-Mimosas in the southern Var region calmed Thursday because of a drop in the wind — but still marked the skyline with dramatic clouds of black smoke that were visible for miles.

""The fire is contained,"" Frederic Marchi-Leccia of the Var Fire and Emergency Service told reporters Thursday of the Bormes-les-Mimosas blaze that's forced many to sleep overnight in gyms and sailing clubs.

Despite the progress, authorities fear there will be flare-ups Thursday afternoon due to lack of moisture and higher winds. Firefighters are still battling blazes in nearby Artigues.

Still, the Var prefecture said fires in some sites in Bormes-les-Mimosas mean it is ""not yet possible"" for displaced residents and tourists to return to their homes and campsites. An afternoon reconnaissance flight will help authorities determine if it's safe to start sending people home.

In the meantime, evacuees are being housed in makeshift shelters. A sailing club near Bormes-Les-Mimosas was hosting 200 people, including tourists, who were evacuated Wednesday night.

One displaced French camper, Stephanie Reiny, who slept at the sailing club, was upbeat on learning that the firefighters were making progress. ""I will go straight away to the camping site for sure ... I'm not scared anymore,"" she said.

Some 3,000 firefighters have been deployed to contain the flames that broke out Monday in the southeast of France and on the island of Corsica that have consumed 7,000 hectares (17,300 acres). There have been no reported casualties.

Wildfires also continued to burn in Portugal, where almost 2,000 firefighters were deployed at six major blazes Thursday. Civil Protection Agency spokeswoman Patricia Gaspar said continuing strong winds and tinder-dry woodland remain a menace. She said no one has been evacuated, but 37 people have been slightly injured in recent days.

The worst-affected areas continued to be in central Portugal, especially a fire around Serta, 200 kilometers (125 miles) northeast of Lisbon, which was burning for a fifth day.

One wildfire last month in Portugal killed 64 people.

397,http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/can-poetry-change-your-life,newyorker,Can Poetry Change Your Life?,[],"The first eight pages of Michael Robbins’s new book, “ Equipment for Living: On Poetry and Pop Music ” (Simon & Schuster), make reference to Annie Dillard, Harold Bloom, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Elton John, Kenneth Burke, Geoffrey Hill, Kenneth Koch, Adam Phillips, Frank O’Hara, Emerson, Boethius, Nietzsche, Freud, and Miley Cyrus. The book is a collection of mostly previously published pieces, some on poetry, some on pop music, some on both, written, as the names suggest, in a critical style that could be called advanced pop. Advanced-pop criticism would be criticism premised on the belief that you can talk about cultural goods loved uncritically by millions in terms originally developed to talk about cultural goods known mainly to an overeducated few. Advanced pop is Boethius and Springsteen, Artaud and the Ramones, and it yields sentences like “I assume that what Burke”—the literary theorist Kenneth Burke—“says about poetry applies, mutatis mutandis, to the songs of Def Leppard.” It’s erudite but caj, geeky and hip, alienated and savvy—on the inside of the outside. Another word for the attitude might be “Brooklyn,” which is indeed where, as an author’s bio unnecessarily informs us, Michael Robbins lives. “Equipment for Living” is funny and smart. It does feel a few bricks shy of a tome. The first and last chapters perform the same work: they unpack, uneasily, the claim stated in the title, which is that poems and songs can make a difference. Most of the chapters are essay-reviews, ranging in length from very brief to brief. Robbins has a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, and an excellent discussion of rhyme in the work of Paul Muldoon is apparently adapted from his dissertation. To fill things out, there is a twenty-eight-page “Playlist,” consisting of staff-picks-type encomiums on the author’s favorites, such as: Skip James “Devil Got My Woman” (1931) Sometimes I think this song defines the limits of what is humanly possible. Sometimes I think it exceeds them. And: Wallace Stevens “The Man with the Blue Guitar,” Canto XXV (1937) A rumpus, a rollick, a roll in the hay . . . There’s only one full-dress essay in the book, and it’s much more heavy-duty than the rest. The subject is the poetry of Frederick Seidel, and the essay handles a familiar critical problem—the morality of bad taste, the Jeff Koons–Michel Houellebecq–Bret Easton Ellis problem—expertly if not entirely originally. The essay does include observations like “The death drive is figured here as the desire to literalize the trope of the subject’s dispersal.” When I hear the words “literalize the trope,” I reach for my remote. Hyperbole is an ever-present danger up there on the high-low tightrope. What helps the critic keep his or her balance is the acknowledgment that it is hyperbole, that there is a rhetoric of aesthetic experience—the experience of reading poems or listening to songs we’re strongly attached to—that is always in excess of the actual content. If you’re going to write about Skip James, it doesn’t make sense to strive for a judicious appraisal. You want to record the temperature at its hottest. By now, a lot of writers have done this sort of thing with Skip James and other old bluesmen, a sacred category for serious pop critics ever since those musicians were “discovered” by rock-and-roll (that is, white) audiences, in the nineteen-sixties, but Robbins can do it with seventeenth-century lyrics as well. You also need to concede that the experience cools fairly quickly, and Robbins is alert to that, too. “ No one has ever changed his life because of a poem or song,” he says in a chapter on metal, with reference to Blake, Milton, Rilke, William Empson, Peter Sloterdijk, Ozzy Osbourne, and Kant. “Changing your life is for Simone Weil or the Buddha. The rest of us need German poetry and Norwegian black metal because they provide the illusion that we are changing, or have changed, or will change, or even want to change our lives.” I don’t completely agree, but it’s a wise caution. Another advanced-pop premise is that everything is happening now. Springsteen and Dylan speak to our current condition, and so do Boethius and Sappho. The envelope may be postmarked 600 B.C.E., but when you open it there is a letter inside, and it’s just for you. The responsible scholarly impulse is to historicize: those words were never intended for you, they signified something completely different in 600 B.C.E. than they do today, and so on. That’s all true. But the text still has a sting. It’s the news that stayed news. Robbins is more interested in the inarticulable or barely articulable sting than he is in reconstructing social relations in the Mediterranean gift economy. (I think you can do both, in fact, and that putting the “then” together with the “now” is the point of doing criticism.) A writer with a playlist of culture heroes must also have a list of the undeserving, the fake, and the fallen, and Robbins does not disappoint us. He writes of the poet James Wright, “It is easy to feel that, if fetal alcohol syndrome could write poetry, it would write this poetry.” He suggests that Robert Hass “has made a career out of flattering middlebrow sensibilities with cheap mystery.” Of Charles Simic: “If the worst are full of passionate intensity, Simic would seem to be in the clear.” He calls Simon and Garfunkel’s “The Sound of Silence” “wimpy crap.” He says that Patti Smith’s memoir “Just Kids” is “highly acclaimed despite her apparent belief that serious writing is principally a matter of avoiding contractions.” His reaction to Neil Young’s memoir is “It’s depressing to learn that one of your heroes writes like a composition student aiming for the earnest tone of a public service announcement.” The Jedi master of this mode of criticism—its presiding spirit, really—is Pauline Kael, the subject of an admiring chapter in “Equipment for Living.” Robbins calls her “the first tastemaker I trusted implicitly.” A lot of Kael’s criticism, like Robbins’s, is buildups and takedowns, but that kind of criticism can get interesting when the writer has to figure out why something that should be good is not, or why something that has no right to be good actually might be. I enjoyed almost all of “Equipment for Living,” but I found Robbins most clever and entertaining when he is trying to make sense of what redeems bands like Journey and Def Leppard, or poets like Dylan Thomas and James Dickey. Those are artists who now seem obviously gassy or fatuous—“Like a mammoth wheel of Monterey Jack left in the sun” is Robbins’s description of Journey’s hit song “Only the Young.” And he often decides that what redeems such works is that they once spoke to him, even if they don’t anymore. “Every song you loved when you were young turns into ‘Tintern Abbey,’ ” as he puts it. “I cannot paint / What then I was,” Wordsworth wrote in that poem, about revisiting the banks of the Wye as a grownup (only five years later, actually, but it’s a poem). Robbins expresses the sentiment this way: “As I listen to ‘Don’t Stop Believin’ ’ today, once again, in the arena of my soul, how high the highest Bic lights the dark.” You can’t go back to being fifteen, but you can remember with respect and longing that time of life, a time when, as Georg Lukács once put it, “the fire that burns in the soul is of the same essential nature as the stars.” Oh, no! Now I’m doing it! “Listening to most rock and roll now involves remembering what it used to do for me that it can’t anymore,” Robbins says. And, in fact, a surprising amount of pop-music criticism is bottled nostalgia, owls that fly at dusk. In preparation for writing about “Equipment for Living,” I got a copy of “ Shake It Up ” (Library of America), an anthology of fifty years of pop-music criticism, “from Elvis to Jay Z,” edited by Jonathan Lethem and Kevin Dettmar. I figured I would dip into its pages and refresh my recollection of the field of play. Many hours later, I had to force myself to put the thing down. A few of the essays in “Shake It Up” are advanced-pop criticism (e.g., the literary critic Richard Poirier on “Learning from the Beatles,” in Partisan Review ), but most are journalism, and the journalism beats the advanced-pop stuff cold. Partly this is because it was written for fans, so the writers could ignore the English department and other highbrow police. Partly it’s because pop-music journalism arose out of the intersection of early rock-and-roll magazines like Rolling Stone and Crawdaddy , when they still had an alternative-press aura, and the New Journalism, with its promiscuous use of the first person, and that gave it a confessional tone and a voice that suggested that we’re all on the same side in the struggle, whatever struggle it is. “Who are you kidding? You’re all about small government until you get stuck in a tree.” But rock criticism does appear to be fixated on what has been lost. It’s always beating back against the current. It seems that in the pop-music business the shelf life of authenticity is tragically short. Ellen Willis on Janis Joplin, Lester Bangs on Elvis Presley, Chuck Klosterman on Mötley Crüe, John Jeremiah Sullivan on Axl Rose, Eve Babitz on Jim Morrison, Geoffrey O’Brien on the Beatles: all those pieces are “Tintern Abbey”s, elegies for gifts that were squandered or misapplied or evanescent. O’Brien thinks it all began to go south for the Beatles after “Help!” And I used to think the Beatles were only worth listening to after “Help!”

But how are poems and pop songs “equipment for life”? Here the balance pole begins to wobble. “There is no limit to what a poem can’t do,” Robbins writes on one page; “poetry makes all sorts of things happen,” he says on the next. Which is it? He doesn’t want to give in to the fantasy that poems taught to and songs bought by millions of people are also subversive of the established order. But his own politics are Occupy-era politics, and he naturally wants to put his views together with his tastes. The teen-ager’s enthusiasm for Def Leppard must in some way belong with the mature man’s concerns about income inequality. He has a couple of ideas about how this might work. One is that the very excess of the aesthetic experience, the fact that it evaporates so fast upon contact with daily life, is a reminder of how impoverished daily life is. It seems that capitalism is to blame here. When capitalism is dead, Robbins suggests, we might not need poetry anymore. O.K., that’s one idea. His other idea is that the key to the real-world effectiveness of poems and songs is “form.” The invocation of form is awkward, for the same reason that advanced-pop criticism itself is inherently awkward, which is that most popular music, and especially popular music categorized as rock, is magnificently and unambiguously hostile to everything associated with the word “school.” And form is a very academic concept. It’s the shell in the game teachers play to hide content. The phrase “equipment for living” is taken from Kenneth Burke, who also wrote that form is “a public matter that symbolically enrolls us with allies who will share the burdens with us.” Robbins likes this. I think it means that the experience of poems and songs is shared with other people, even if often implicitly, and so it can be a means of achieving solidarity. Form “grounds us in a community,” Robbins says. This might be a little wishful. Reading poems is normally a solitary pastime, and so is a lot of music listening, except at concerts, where the emotions aren’t really your own. In any case, form cuts no political ice. The Rolling Stones’ “You Can’t Always Get What You Want,” once an anthem of antiwar protesters, is played at Trump rallies. I assume it instills feelings of solidarity among his supporters. With aesthetic experience in general, after a certain age, the effects are probably as much a product of what you bring to it as what you get from it. “Records are useful equipment for living, provided you don’t expect more from them than they contain,” Robbins says. This is an echo of Dylan—“Songs are songs,” Dylan once said; “I don’t believe in expecting too much out of any one thing”—and it seems about right. But what, in the end, do we get from poems and songs? “Aesthetic life is a sphere of self-directed activity whose external ramifications, despite periodic utopian exuberances, are minimal at best,” Robbins concludes (somewhat contradicting his “community” theory). Is this so? Are we past the days when people wrote poetry and read it for encouragement and guidance, the days when poetry was not merely a “self-directed activity” but was writing about something?

It certainly was once. On August 4, 1914, Great Britain declared war on Germany. On August 5th, the first war poem appeared in the London Times —“The Vigil,” by Henry Newbolt. By the end of the year, at least two anthologies of war poetry were out, “Poems of the Great War” and “Songs and Sonnets for England in War Time.” Many would follow. Around the time the fighting ended, four years later, more than two thousand British and Irish writers had written poems about the war. We might assume that the First World War inspired a lot of poems because that’s how people expressed themselves in the age of print, and that people express themselves differently today because the media are different. But we would assume wrong. Donald Trump was elected President on November 8, 2016. A poem about his election, “You’re Dead, America,” by Danez Smith, appeared on BuzzFeed on November 9th. A few days later, hundreds showed up in Washington Square Park for a pop-up poetry reading sponsored by the Academy of American Poets and the Web site Brain Pickings. Three days after the Inauguration, the Times columnist Nicholas Kristof announced a Donald Trump Poetry Contest. He got about two thousand submissions. Several anthologies with anti-Trump poems have already come out, including, in May, “ Resistance, Rebellion, Life: 50 Poems Now ” (Knopf), edited by Amit Majmudar, who was one of the winners in Kristof’s contest. Every crisis is an opportunity for poetry, even in the twenty-first century. There are anthologies of 9/11 poems and anthologies of Iraq War poems. There are climate-change poems, income-inequality poems, and Black Lives Matter poems. Claudia Rankine’s “ Citizen: An American Lyric ,” a book-length poem about race, identity, and the imagination, has sold almost two hundred thousand copies since it was published, in 2014. After the terrorist attacks in Paris on November 13, 2015, hundreds of thousands read “It is not Paris we should pray for,” posted on social media by the Indian poet Karuna Ezara Parikh. When the going gets stressful, the stressed want poems.

So why are people who write about poetry so defensive? Robbins gives the appearance of a man straining to come up with a rationale for bothering to read and write poems at all. And he’s an optimist. In “ The Hatred of Poetry ” (Farrar, Straus & Giroux), published last year, Ben Lerner argues that poems simply can’t do what people want them to do—create timeless moments, or express individual experiences with universal appeal, or create a sense of communal identity, or overturn existing social mores, or articulate “a measure of value beyond money.” All they can do is expose the impossibility of achieving any of these things by writing a poem. Of course people who don’t read poetry hate it, he says; it’s not doing what they mistakenly believe it’s supposed to do. But poets hate it, too. Poetry is a paradigm example of human inadequacy. In “ Why Poetry? ” (Ecco), out this summer, Matthew Zapruder defines a poet as a writer who is prepared “to reject all other purposes, in favor of the possibilities of language freed from utility.” Where people who are puzzled by poetry go wrong, he thinks, is in expecting poems to say something straightforward about life, to be useful. Poems are really about language—ultimately, about the impossibility of fixed meanings. Lerner and Zapruder are successful mid-career poets. (So is Robbins, who has brought out two collections with Penguin.) Lerner is also well known for his novels, “ Leaving the Atocha Station ” and “ 10:04 .” Zapruder has published four collections of poetry and was the editor of the Times Magazine poetry page. We can add to their books David Orr’s “ Beautiful and Pointless: A Guide to Modern Poetry ,” which came out in 2011. The title states the problem. “I can’t tell you why you should bother to read poems, or to write them,” Orr concludes. “I can only say that if you do choose to give your attention to poetry, as against all other things you might turn to instead, that choice can be meaningful.” Not the most robust commendation—and Orr is the poetry critic of the Times Book Review . How can it be the case that poems are ineffectual and self-absorbed ephemera when the Presidential election produced a Trump bump in the poetry world, when hundreds of people submit poems to a newspaper contest, when dozens of poetry anthologies are in print, and when a book-length poem sells two hundred thousand copies, a number reached by very few works of prose? What would count for writers like Lerner and Zapruder as a meaningful poem, or a poem that made a difference? It is almost as though a poem that actually communicated something to someone could not be a real poem. There seems to be a disconnect between the practice and the theory. Where did that come from?

Probably it’s as old as writing. What has long been presumed to be the earliest writing, the Sumerian tablets, comprises administrative records. But if people could write down factual stuff they could also write down made-up stuff, and there must have soon developed an account of the difference. That account would have explained how made-up stuff needs to be read differently from factual stuff, why made-up stuff has effects on us that factual stuff does not, and what sort of practical work, if any, fiction might be doing in our lives. “Well, I guess we can leave the sign as is.” This distinction between fiction and nonfiction, whenever it dates from, but certainly, in the West, since Plato, has produced a heap of abstractions, and those abstractions are what I think these writers are getting hung up on. “Fiction” and “nonfiction” are made to operate as oppositely charged magnets attracting incompatible values. Nonfiction is logical; fiction is associative. Nonfiction is literal and truthful, fiction figurative and imaginary. Nonfiction is objective and communicates, but fiction is subjective and expresses. Fiction is supposed to represent not literal truth but a mysterious entity called “emotional truth.” Indeterminacy and obscurity are out of place in nonfiction but acceptable in fiction. In this opposition, poetry sits at the extreme end, the mode of writing least like nonfiction. The consequence is a kind of inside-out justification for poems in which poetry beats nonfiction at its own game by refusing to play it. “He nothing affirms, and therefore never lieth,” Sir Philip Sidney famously wrote of the poet in “ The Defense of Poesie ,” and his is the model formulation. (“I have more just cause to make a pitiful defense of poor Poetry, which from almost the highest estimation of learning, is fallen to be the laughing stock of children,” Sidney began the “Defense.” It was posthumously published in 1595, around the time Shakespeare wrote “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” and the year before Edmund Spenser published a large portion of “The Faerie Queene.” That was a pretty big disconnect.) So Lerner offers conundrums like poetry’s “usefulness depends on its lack of practical utility,” and Zapruder describes a poem as “making meaning by failing to fully make meaning.” With poems, Zapruder says, “we get to a truth that is beyond our ability to articulate when we are attempting to ‘use’ language to convey our ideas or stories.” Poetry isn’t true, in the ordinary sense, but apparently that makes it truthier. Do readers really need these distinctions? Ancient-world readers of Homer must have known how much of the Odyssey was fanciful and how much of it was true, and in what sense. Their notion of what mattered was undoubtedly different from ours, but we, too, can read the Odyssey for what it tells us—about social relations in the Mediterranean gift economy, for example. The distinction between the fictional and the nonfictional is much blurrier in practice than it is in theory. Lerner says that we expect too much from poetry. That’s right, and we expect too much from nonfiction, too. Virtually all writing is parts literal and parts figural, parts “critical” and parts “creative.” And its ability to effect change in people’s personal or political lives has nothing to do with its degree of “fictionality.” One of Lerner’s chief examples of misplaced expectations for poetry is what he calls “nostalgia for a poetry that could supposedly reconcile the individual and the social, and so transform millions of individuals into an authentic People.” He says that this kind of poetry never existed. To which there is a one-word response: Dante. The Divine Comedy is a first-person poem about a man who suffers a crisis (“I found myself in a dark wood, for the straight way was lost”), which he resolves by undertaking an imaginary journey that he pretends has been made possible by the soul of a dead woman he loved. That poem, written in the vernacular in the fourteenth century, is still at the heart of national identity in Italy. As the Iliad and the Odyssey were for ancient Greece, and as the Aeneid was for Rome. Lerner, to be fair, is mainly concerned with lyric poetry (another unstable category: is “The Waste Land” a lyric?). He argues that “there are no good examples of ‘superb lyric poems’ that at once ‘have something to say’ utterly specific to a poet’s ‘experience’ and can speak for all.” “Utterly” and “all” make for a narrow window—nothing is utterly one kind of thing, and no one speaks for all—but, even leaving aside the many lyric poets who, because of their bodies of work, became representative figures for a people or a nation, from Bashō to Yeats and Neruda, and even leaving aside the many lyric poets who were persecuted as threats to the regime, from Ovid to Anna Akhmatova and Joseph Brodsky, there are plenty of lyric poems that are “utterly” personal and yet speak for many. One of the founding documents of African and Caribbean anticolonialism, Aimé Césaire’s “Notebook of a Return to the Native Land,” is a lyric poem. So is Adrienne Rich’s “Diving Into the Wreck,” an inspirational text for the women’s movement. It’s weird to think that these works don’t count. All the poems in the anti-Trump collection “Resistance, Rebellion, Life” are lyrics, and many begin with a story that is utterly personal. Sharon Olds’s “Immigration Anthem” starts with her hip operation and ends on Ellis Island before the golden door: entering through it was a promise to leave it open behind us. Zapruder is more hospitable to poems with political ambitions, and he discusses several, including one of the most controversial poems of the twenty-first century, Amiri Baraka’s “Somebody Blew Up America,” on the attacks of September 11th. Zapruder calls the poem “glorious” and “problematic.” But he thinks that what makes it a poem are the questions it raises and cannot answer, rather than any points it might seek to make. “We find genuine questions everywhere in poetry because they direct the language away from certainty and stasis,” Zapruder explains. “In the best poems, often the poet does not know the answer.” The less confident Baraka is about what he thinks, in other words, the more poetic his poem. “Unlike other forms of writing, poetry takes as its primary task to insist and depend upon and celebrate the troubled relation of the word to what it represents,” Zapruder claims. Some version of this notion—that, whatever the ostensible subject matter, poems are “about” language—has been current in English departments since the days of the New Criticism. Language is a profoundly mysterious technology, so constitutive of the human mind that we can only get glimpses, from inside the fishbowl of consciousness, of how it works. And the study of literary technique is a great way to explore the nature of language. But here is the opening stanza of Frederick Seidel’s poem in “Resistance, Rebellion, Life,” called “Now”: And you could say we’ve been living in clover From Walt Whitman to Barack Obama. Now a dictatorship of vicious spineless slimes We the people voted in has taken over. Once we’d abolished slavery, we lived in clover, From sea to shining sea, even in terrible times. It’s over. “The troubled relation of the word to what it represents” is not what jumps out at me here."

Hundreds of thousands of young men were being deployed to Vietnam. Trump had some bone spurs. He then limped happily into his father’s real-estate business without delay.

When Trump was interviewed by the Times about his deferment during the 2016 campaign, he admitted that the foot condition was “temporary” and “minor”—usually orthotics or stretching eased the pain—and yet, “I had a doctor that gave me a letter—a very strong letter on the heels.” He promised the paper that he would look for the letter. Amazingly, it never turned up. Later, however, his unforgettable physician, Dr. Harold N. Bornstein, assured the nation that Trump, if elected, “will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.”

On Wednesday morning, the Commander-in-Chief declared by tweet-fiat that, “after consultation with my Generals and military experts,” he had decided to reverse an Obama Administration decision and bar transgender individuals from serving in the military “in any capacity.” Trump tweeted further, “Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming . . . victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.”

Let’s begin with the retrograde cruelty. There are thousands of transgender people already serving among the 1.3 million active-duty members of the military. These are people who have volunteered their service and have potentially put their lives on the line, and yet their President, who managed to come up with a flimsy doctor’s note back in the day, denies them their dignity, their equality. He will not “accept or allow” them in the military. Imagine the scale of this insult.

However, today’s outrage—they seem to come at least once daily—is not merely one that reflects on Trump’s low character. It also reveals yet another layer of his political cynicism, and his willingness to use any tactical means available to try to emerge whole from his current predicament.

The President is in the midst of a colossal scandal, and the country, to an increasing measure, knows it. It’s not merely a matter of poor popularity polls. A sizable portion of the country wants to be rid of him and suspects he is unworthy of his office. Six months into his Presidency, according to a USA Today /Media Ethics poll, the country is split on whether or not he should be impeached, with forty-two per cent on either side of the question. The scandal is broad-based, but it surely includes (but is not limited to) contacts with Russian officials during the campaign and potential collusion to undermine the Clinton campaign; the constant lying about same; the firing of James Comey; the threats to fire Jeff Sessions and Robert Mueller; the appalling vulgarity of his public performances (cf. the “Playboy After Dark” speech before the Boy Scouts of America ); the accumulating evidence of a history of sleazy business practices and partners; and the level of sheer incompetence in the West Wing.

It is implausible that Trump paid much attention to his highest-ranking generals, or to experts, generally; Secretary of Defense James Mattis has supported transgender individuals joining the military. And the hardly radical Rand Corporation has published an in-depth study refuting the idea that transgender soldiers are somehow expensive, or that they undermine the morale and cohesion of the military over all. Trump’s decision to bar transgender people from the military is pure politics, cheap and cruel politics, a naked attempt to divert attention from his woes, to hold on to support from his base—a base that he believes will cheer his latest attempt to do battle with the secular-humanist coastal élites who are so obsessed with identity politics. (One Administration official told Axios’s Jonathan Swan that the move was intended to force Democrats from Rust Belt states to take “complete ownership of this issue.”) In other words, it is a decision straight out of the Steve Bannon playbook. Cue the organs of the alt-right press.

Trump likes to declare what a “disaster” the military is, how deeply it has fallen into disrepair, and how he will be its salvation. When you begin to consider the meanness of what Trump has done, it is worth remembering him saying that he was “smarter” than the generals on military matters, and that he mocked John McCain’s service in Vietnam because “I like people who weren’t captured.” When you begin to think about the scale of this offense, it is worth remembering Khizr Khan , the Gold Star father who lost a son in Iraq, addressing Trump directly from the lectern of the Democratic National Convention: “You have sacrificed nothing and no one.”"

That was, until he adopted a “tiny, tiny” new kitten, Sasuke, named after a cartoon ninja, who vanished from Fukase’s Tokyo apartment ten days after he arrived. “I put up about a hundred ‘Lost Cat’ posters around my neighborhood, but he still didn’t come back,” Fukase wrote. He was living alone again, catless, until, a few weeks later, a woman called him about a stray that “looked just like the cat on the poster.” A meeting was scheduled at the woman’s office. Fukase had been ready to gift her a bottle of good whiskey when he realized that the stray was not Sasuke. “Well, let’s go with this guy anyway,” he thought.

He took the cat in and named him Sasuke Number Two, perhaps hoping that Number Two would be sensitive to the spirit of his predecessor. Fukase doted on his new companion, and a loving relationship followed—one that’s documented in “ Afterword ,” a posthumous collection of Fukase’s photographs of Sasuke Number Two, which is now in its second printing by the Japanese imprint Roshin Books. Fukase is best known for the ominous images of birds published in his 1986 book “Ravens.” The images of Sasuke Number Two, shot during the same period, betray a more playful, joyous eye. Each image seems to discover a new shade of the cat’s colossal personality; no feline gesture is too small to celebrate. Fukase writes, “I wonder if any other photographer in the world has photographed as many cat yawns as I have.”"

Before dawn, a fishing trawler carrying more than five hundred East African migrants from Libya had stalled a quarter of a mile from Lampedusa, a tiny island halfway to Sicily. The driver had dipped a cloth in leaking fuel and ignited it, hoping to draw help. But the fire quickly spread, and as passengers rushed away the boat capsized, trapping and killing hundreds of people. The Central Mediterranean migration crisis was entering a new phase. Each week, smugglers were cramming hundreds of African migrants into small boats and launching them in the direction of Europe, with little regard for the chances of their making it. Mass drownings had become common. Still, the Lampedusa shipwreck was striking for its scale and its proximity: Italians watched from the cliffs as the coast guard spent a week recovering the corpses. As news crews descended on the island, the coffins were laid out in an airplane hangar and topped with roses and Teddy bears. “It shocked me, because, maybe for the first time, they decided to show pictures of the coffins,” Ferrara told me. Italy declared a day of national mourning and started carrying out search-and-rescue operations near Libyan waters. Shortly afterward, a group of survivors in Lampedusa attacked a man whom they recognized from the boat, claiming that he had been the driver and that he was affiliated with smugglers in Libya. The incident changed the way that Ferrara thought about the migration crisis. “I went to the chief prosecutor and said, ‘Look, we have three hundred and sixty-eight dead people in territory under our jurisdiction,’ ” Ferrara said. “We spend I don’t know how much energy and resources on a single Mafia hit, where one or two people are killed.” If smuggling networks were structured like the Mafia, Ferrara realized, arresting key bosses could lead to fewer boats and fewer deaths at sea. The issue wasn’t only humanitarian. With each disembarkation, public opinion was hardening against migrants, and the political appetite for accountability for their constant arrivals was growing. Ferrara’s office regarded smugglers in Africa and Europe as a transnational criminal network, and every boat they sent across the Mediterranean as a crime against Italy. Ferrara is confident and ambitious, a small man in his forties with brown, curly hair, a short-cropped beard, and a deep, gravelly voice. The walls of his office are hung with tributes to his service and his success. When I met with him, in May, he sat with his feet on his desk, wearing teal-rimmed glasses and smoking a Toscano cigar. Shelves bowed under dozens of binders, each containing thousands of pages of documents—transcripts of wiretaps and witness statements for high-profile criminal cases. In the hall, undercover cops with pistols tucked beneath their T-shirts waited to escort prosecutors wherever they went. Sicilian prosecutors are granted tremendous powers, which stem from their reputation as the only thing standing between society and the Cosa Nostra. Beginning in the late nineteen-seventies, the Sicilian Mafia waged a vicious war against the Italian state. Its adherents assassinated journalists, prosecutors, judges, police officers, and politicians, and terrorized their colleagues into submission. As Alexander Stille writes in “ Excellent Cadavers ,” from 1995, the only way to prove that you weren’t colluding with the Mafia was to be killed by it. In 1980, after it was leaked that Gaetano Costa, the chief prosecutor of Palermo, had signed fifty-five arrest warrants, he was gunned down in the street by the Cosa Nostra. Three years later, his colleague Rocco Chinnici was killed by a car bomb. In response, a small group of magistrates formed an anti-Mafia pool; each member agreed to put his name on every prosecutorial order, so that none could be singled out for assassination. By 1986, the anti-Mafia team was ready to bring charges against four hundred and seventy-five mobsters, in what became known as the “maxi-trial,” the world’s largest Mafia proceeding. The trial was held inside a massive bunker in Palermo, constructed for the occasion, whose walls could withstand an attack by rocket-propelled grenades. Led by Giovanni Falcone, the prosecutors secured three hundred and forty-four convictions. A few years after the trial, Falcone took a job in Rome. But on May 23, 1992, as he was returning home to Palermo, the Cosa Nostra detonated half a ton of explosives under the highway near the airport, killing Falcone, his wife, and his police escorts. The explosives, left over from ordnance that was dropped during the Second World War, had been collected by divers from the bottom of the Mediterranean; the blast was so large that it registered on earthquake monitors. Fifty-seven days later, mobsters killed one of the remaining members of the anti-Mafia pool, Falcone’s friend and investigative partner Paolo Borsellino. Following these murders, the Italian military dispatched seven thousand troops to Sicily. Prosecutors were now allowed to wiretap anyone suspected of having connections to organized crime. They also had the authority to lead investigations, rather than merely argue the findings in court, and to give Mafia witnesses incentives for coöperation. That year, magistrates in Milan discovered a nationwide corruption system; its exposure led to the dissolution of local councils, the destruction of Italy’s major political parties, and the suicides of a number of businessmen and politicians who had been named for taking bribes. More than half the members of the Italian parliament came under investigation. “The people looked to the prosecutors as the only hope for the country,” a Sicilian journalist told me. Shortly after the Lampedusa tragedy, Ferrara, with assistance from the Ministry of Interior, helped organize a team of élite prosecutors and investigators. When investigating organized crime, “for which we are famous in Palermo,” Ferrara said, “you can request wiretappings or interception of live communications with a threshold of evidence that is much lower than for common crimes.” In practice, “it means that when you request of the investigative judge an interception for organized crime, ninety-nine per cent of the time you get it.” Because rescue boats routinely deposit migrants at Sicilian ports, most weeks were marked by the arrivals of more than a thousand potential witnesses. Ferrara’s team started collecting information at disembarkations and migrant-reception centers, and before long they had the phone numbers of drivers, hosts, forgers, and money agents. The investigation was named Operation Glauco, for Glaucus, a Greek deity with prophetic powers who came to the rescue of sailors in peril. According to Ferrara, Sicily’s proximity to North Africa enabled his investigators to pick up calls in which both speakers were in Africa. Italian telecommunications companies often serve as a data hub for Internet traffic and calls. “We have conversations in Khartoum passing through Palermo,” he said. By monitoring phone calls, investigators gradually reconstructed an Eritrean network that had smuggled tens of thousands of East Africans to Europe on boats that left from Libya. By 2015, the Glauco investigations had resulted in dozens of arrests in Italy, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Most of the suspects were low-level figures who may not have been aware that they were committing a crime by, for example, taking money to drive migrants from a migrant camp in Sicily to a connection house—a temporary shelter, run by smugglers—in Milan. But the bosses in Africa seemed untouchable. “In Libya, we know who they are and where they are,” Ferrara said. “But the problem is that you can’t get any kind of coöperation” from local forces. The dragnet indicated that an Eritrean, based in Tripoli, was at the center of the network. He was born in 1981, and his name was Medhanie Yehdego Mered. “It’s great to see so many new faces here tonight!”

On May 23, 2014, Ferrara’s investigative team started wiretapping Mered’s Libyan number. Mered’s network in Tripoli was linked to recruiters and logisticians in virtually every major population center in East Africa. With each boat’s departure, he earned tens of thousands of dollars. In July, Mered told an associate, in a wiretapped call, that he had smuggled between seven and eight thousand people to Europe. In October, he moved to Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, for two months. The Italians found his Facebook page and submitted into evidence a photograph of a dour man wearing a blue shirt and a silver chain with a large crucifix. “This is Medhanie,” a migrant who had briefly worked for him told prosecutors in Rome. “He is a king in Libya. He’s very respected. He’s one of the few—perhaps the only one—who can go out with a cross around his neck.” In 2015, a hundred and fifty thousand refugees and migrants crossed from Libya to Europe, and almost three thousand drowned. Each Thursday afternoon, Eritreans tune in to Radio Erena, a Tigrinya-language station, for a show hosted by the Swedish-Eritrean journalist and activist Meron Estefanos. Broadcasting from her kitchen, in Stockholm, she is in touch with hundreds of migrants, activists, and smugglers. Often, when Estefanos criticizes a smuggler, he will call in to her program to complain. In February, 2015, Estefanos reported that men who worked for Mered were raping female migrants. Mered called in to deny the rape allegations, but he admitted other bad practices and attempted to justify them. “I asked, ‘Why do you send people without life jackets?’ ” Estefanos said. “And he said, ‘I can’t buy life jackets, because if I buy five hundred life jackets I will be suspected of being a smuggler.’ ” He told Estefanos it was true that people went hungry in his connection house, but that it wasn’t his fault. “My people in Sudan—I tell them to send me five hundred refugees, and they send me two thousand,” he said. “I got groceries for five hundred people, and now I have to make it work!” Mered was becoming wealthy, but he wasn’t the kingpin that some considered him to be. In the spring of 2013, after arriving in Libya as a refugee, he negotiated passage to Tripoli by helping smugglers with menial tasks. Then, in June, he began working with a Libyan man named Ali, whose family owned an empty building near the sea, which could be used as a connection house. According to Mered’s clients, he instructed associates in other parts of East Africa to tell migrants that they worked for Abdulrazzak, known among Eritreans as one of the most powerful smugglers. Those who were duped into paying Mered’s team were furious when they reached the connection house and learned that Mered and Ali were not connected to Abdulrazzak, and that they had failed to strike a deal with the men who launched the boats. When the pair eventually arranged their first departure, all three vessels were intercepted before they could leave Libyan waters, and the passengers were jailed. By the end of the summer, more than three hundred and fifty migrants were languishing in the connection house. Finally, in September, a fleet of taxis shuttled them to the beach in small groups to board boats. Five days later, the Italian coast guard rescued Mered’s passengers and, therefore, his reputation as a smuggler as well. In December, Mered brought hundreds of migrants to the beach, including an Eritrean I’ll call Yonas. “He was sick of Tripoli,” Yonas told me. “He was ready to come with us—to take the sea trip.” But the shores were controlled by Libyans; to them, Mered’s ability to organize payments and speak with East African migrants in Tigrinya was an invaluable part of the business. Ali started shouting at Mered and slapping him. “That’s when I understood that he was not that powerful,” Yonas recalled. “Our lives depended on the Libyans, not on Medhanie. To them, he was no better than any of us—he was just another Eritrean refugee.”

In April, 2015, the Palermo magistrate’s office issued a warrant for Mered’s arrest. The authorities also released the photograph of him wearing a crucifix, in the hope that someone might give him up. Days later, Mered’s face appeared in numerous European publications. News of Mered’s indictment spread quickly in Libya. One night, Mered called Estefanos in a panic. “It’s like a fatwa against me,” he said. “They put my life in danger.” He claimed that, in the days after he was named in the press, he had been kidnapped three times; a Libyan general had negotiated his release. Mered asked Estefanos what would happen to him if he tried to come to Europe to be with his wife, Lidya Tesfu, who had crossed the Mediterranean and given birth to their son in Sweden the previous year. It was as if he hadn’t fully grasped the Italian case against him. Not only did Mered think that the Italians had exaggerated his importance but “he saw himself as a kind of activist, helping people who were desperate,” Estefanos told me. Shortly before midnight on June 6, 2015, Mered called Estefanos, sounding drunk or high. “He didn’t want me to ask questions,” she told me. “He said, ‘Just listen.’ ” During the next three hours, Mered detailed his efforts to rescue several Eritrean hostages from the Islamic State, which had established a base in Sirte, Libya. Now, Mered said, he was driving out of Libya, toward the Egyptian border, with four of the women in the back of his truck. As Estefanos remembers it, “Mered said, ‘I’m holding a Kalashnikov and a revolver, to defend myself. If something happens at the Egyptian-Libyan border, I’m not going to surrender. I’m going to kill as many as I can, and die myself. Wish me luck!’ ” He never called again. From that point forward, Estefanos occasionally heard from Mered’s associates, some of whom wanted to betray him and take over the business. Mered was photographed at a wedding in Sudan and spotted at a bar in Ethiopia. He posted photos to Facebook from a mall in Dubai. Italian investigators lost track of him. But on January 21, 2016, Ferrara received a detailed note from Roy Godding, an official from Britain’s National Crime Agency, which leads the country’s efforts against organized crime and human trafficking. Godding wrote that the agency was “in possession of credible and sustained evidence” that Mered had a residence in Khartoum, and that he “spends a significant amount of his time in that city.” The N.C.A. believed that Mered would leave soon—possibly by the end of April—and so, Godding wrote, “we have to act quickly.” Still, Godding had concerns. In Sudan, people-smuggling can carry a penalty of death, which was abolished in the United Kingdom more than fifty years ago. If the Italian and British governments requested Mered’s capture, Godding said, he should be extradited to Italy, spending “as little time as possible” in Sudanese custody. Although Godding’s sources believed that Mered had “corrupt relationships” with Sudanese authorities, he figured that the N.C.A. and the Palermo magistrate could work through “trusted partners” within the regime. (Sudan’s President has been charged in absentia by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity, but the European Union pays his government tens of millions of euros each year to contain migration.) Ferrara’s team began drawing up an extradition request. The Palermo magistrate had already started wiretapping Mered’s Sudanese number, and also that of his wife, Tesfu, and his brother Merhawi, who had immigrated to the Netherlands two years earlier. The taps on Mered’s number yielded no results. But, on March 19th, Merhawi mentioned in a call that a man named Filmon had told him that Mered was in Dubai and would probably return to Khartoum soon. In mid- May, the N.C.A. informed Ferrara’s team of a new Sudanese telephone number that they suspected was being used by Mered. The Palermo magistrate started wiretapping it immediately. On May 24th, as the Sudanese authorities welcomed European delegates to an international summit on halting migration and human trafficking, the police tracked the location of the phone and made an arrest. Two weeks later, the suspect was extradited to Italy on a military jet. The next morning, at a press conference in Palermo, the prosecutors announced that they had captured Medhanie Yehdego Mered. “Whoever pulls it out becomes King of Britain, but Phil licked the handle, so . . .” Coverage of the arrest ranged from implausible to absurd. The BBC erroneously reported that Mered had presided over a “multibillion-dollar empire.” A British tabloid claimed that he had given millions of dollars to the Islamic State. The N.C.A., which had spent years hunting for Mered, issued a press release incorrectly stating that he was “responsible for the Lampedusa tragedy.” Meanwhile, the Palermo prosecutor’s office reportedly said that Mered had styled himself in the manner of Muammar Qaddafi, and that he was known among smugglers as the General—even though the only reference to that nickname came from a single wiretapped call from 2014 that, according to the official transcript, was conducted “in an ironic tone.” Ferrara boasted that Mered had been “one of the four most important human smugglers in Africa.” On June 10th, the suspect was interrogated by three prosecutors from the Palermo magistrate. The chief prosecutor, Francesco Lo Voi, asked if he understood the accusations against him. “Why did you tell me that I’m Medhanie Yehdego?” the man replied. “Did you understand the accusations against you?” Lo Voi repeated. “Yes,” he said. “But why did you tell me that I’m Medhanie Yehdego?” “Yeah, apart from the name . . .”

Lo Voi can’t have been surprised by the suspect’s question. Two days earlier, when the Italians released a video of the man in custody—handcuffed and looking scared, as he descended from the military jet—Estefanos received phone calls from Eritreans on at least four continents. Most were perplexed. “This guy doesn’t even look like him,” an Eritrean refugee who was smuggled from Libya by Mered said. He figured that the Italians had caught Mered but used someone else’s picture from stock footage. For one caller in Khartoum, a woman named Seghen, however, the video solved a mystery: she had been looking for her brother for more than two weeks, and was stunned to see him on television. She said that her brother was more than six years younger than Mered; their only common traits were that they were Eritreans named Medhanie. Estefanos told me, “I didn’t know how to contact the Italians, so I contacted Patrick Kingsley,” the Guardian’s migration correspondent, whose editor arranged for him to work with Lorenzo Tondo, a Sicilian journalist in Palermo. That evening, just before sunset, Ferrara received a series of messages from Tondo, on WhatsApp. “Gery, call me—there’s some absurd news going around,” Tondo, who knew Ferrara from previous cases, wrote. “The Guardian just contacted me. They’re saying that, according to some Eritrean sources, the man in custody is not Mered.” Ferrara was not deterred, but he was irritated that the Sudanese hadn’t passed along any identification papers or fingerprints. That night, Tondo and Kingsley wrote in the Guardian that Italian and British investigators were “looking into whether the Sudanese had sent them the wrong man.” Soon afterward, one of Ferrara’s superiors informed Tondo that the prosecution office would no longer discuss the arrest. “I’ve decided on a press blackout,” he said. In recent years, smuggling trials in Italy have often been shaped more by politics than by the pursuit of truth or justice. As long as Libya is in chaos, there is no way to prevent crowded dinghies from reaching international waters, where most people who aren’t rescued will drown. At disembarkations, police officers sometimes use the threat of arrest to coerce refugees into identifying whichever migrant had been tasked with driving the boat, then charge him as a smuggler. The accused is typically represented by a public defender who doesn’t speak his language or have the time, the resources, or the understanding of the smuggling business to build a credible defense. Those who were driving boats in which people drowned are often charged with manslaughter. Hundreds of migrants have been convicted in this way, giving a veneer of success to an ineffective strategy for slowing migration. When the man being held as Mered was assigned state representation, Tondo intervened. “I knew that this guy was not going to be properly defended,” he told me. “And, if there was a chance that he was innocent, it was my duty—not as a journalist but as a human—to help him. So I put the state office in touch with my friend Michele Calantropo,” a defense lawyer who had previously worked on migration issues. For Tondo, the arrangement was also strategic. “The side effect was that now I had an important source of information inside the case,” he said. On June 10th, in the interrogation room, the suspect was ordered to provide his personal details. He picked up a pencil and started slowly writing in Tigrinya. For almost two minutes, the only sound was birdsong from an open window. An interpreter read his testimony for the record: “My name is Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe, born in Asmara on May 12, 1987.”

That afternoon, Berhe, Calantropo, and three prosecutors met with a judge. “If you give false testimony regarding your identity, it is a crime in Italy,” the judge warned. Berhe testified that he had lived in Asmara, the capital of Eritrea. Like many other refugees, he had fled the country during his mandatory military service. “So, what kind of work have you done in your life?” the judge asked. “I was a carpenter. And I sold milk.” “You what?” “I sold milk.” “Are you married?” “No,” Berhe said. “Who did you live with in Asmara?” “My mom.” “O.K., Mr. Medhanie,” the judge said. “I’m now going to read you the, um, the crimes—the things you’re accused of doing.” “O.K.” The judge spent the next several minutes detailing a complex criminal enterprise that spanned eleven countries and three continents, and involved numerous accomplices, thousands of migrants, and millions of euros in illicit profits. She listed several boatloads of people who had passed through Mered’s connection house and arrived in Italy in 2014. Berhe sat in silence as the interpreter whispered rapidly into his ear. After the judge finished listing the crimes, she asked Berhe, “So, what do you have to say about this?” “I didn’t do it,” he replied. “In 2014, I was in Asmara, so those dates don’t even make sense.” “And where did you go after you left Asmara?” “I went to Ethiopia, where I stayed for three months. And then I went to Sudan.” There, Berhe had failed to find a job, so he lived with several other refugees. Berhe and his sister were supported by sporadic donations of three hundred dollars from a brother who lives in the United States. Berhe had spent the past two and a half weeks in isolation, but his testimony matched the accounts of friends and relatives who had spoken to Estefanos and other members of the press. “Listen, I have to ask you something,” the judge said. “Do you even know Medhanie Yehdego Mered?” “No,” Berhe replied. “I don’t have any more questions,” the judge said. “Anyone else?” “Your honor, whatever the facts he just put forward, in reality he is the right defendant,” Claudio Camilleri, one of the prosecutors, said. “He was delivered to us as Mered,” he insisted, pointing to the extradition forms. “You can read it very clearly: ‘Mered.’ ” Along with Berhe, the Sudanese government had handed over a cell phone, a small calendar, and some scraps of paper, which it said were the only objects in Berhe’s possession at the time of the arrest. But when the judge asked Berhe if he owned a passport he said yes. “It’s in Sudan,” he said. “They took it. It was in my pocket, but they took it.” “Excuse me—at the moment of the arrest, you had your identity documents with you?” she asked. “Yes, I had them. But they took my I.D.” Berhe told his lawyer that the Sudanese police had beaten him and asked for money. As a jobless refugee, he had nothing to give, so they notified Interpol that they had captured Mered. The prosecutors also focussed on his mobile phone, which had been tapped shortly before he was arrested. “The contents of these conversations touched on illicit activities of the sort relevant to this dispute,” Camilleri said. At the time, Berhe’s cousin had been migrating through Libya, en route to Europe, and he had called Berhe to help arrange a payment to the connection man. “So, you know people who are part of the organizations that send migrants,” the judge noted. “Why were they calling you, if you are a milkman?” The interrogation continued in this manner, with the authorities regarding as suspicious everything that they didn’t understand about the lives of refugees who travel the perilous routes that they were trying to disrupt. At one point, Berhe found himself explaining the fundamentals of the hawala system—an untraceable money-transfer network built on trust between distant brokers—to a prosecutor who had spent years investigating smugglers whose business depends on it. When Berhe mentioned that one of his friends in Khartoum worked at a bar, the judge heard barche , the Italian word for boats. “He sells boats?” she asked. “No, no,” Berhe said. “He sells fruit juice.” “Great—now we’re endangered and reviled.” The prosecutors also asked Berhe about the names of various suspects in the Glauco investigations. But in most cases they knew only smugglers’ nicknames or first names, many of which are common in Eritrea. Berhe, recognizing some of the names as those of his friends and relatives, began to implicate himself. “Mera Merhawi?” a prosecutor asked. Mered’s brother is named Merhawi. “Well, Mera is just short for Merhawi,” Berhe explained. “O.K., you had a conversation with . . .” “Yes! Merhawi is in Libya. He left with my cousin Gherry.” Believing that coöperation was the surest path to exoneration, Berhe provided the password for his e-mail and Facebook accounts; it was “Filmon,” the name of one of his friends in Khartoum. The prosecutors seized on this, remembering that Filmon was the name of the person identified in a wiretap of Mered’s brother Merhawi. The prosecution failed to note that Berhe has twelve Filmons among his Facebook friends; Mered has five Filmons among his. After the interrogation, the Palermo magistrate ordered a forensic analysis of Berhe’s phone and social-media accounts, to comb the data for inconsistencies. When officers ran everything through the Glauco database, they discovered that one of the scraps of paper submitted by the Sudanese authorities included the phone number of a man named Solomon, who in 2014 had spoken with Mered about hawala payments at least seventy-eight times. They also found that, although Berhe had said that he didn’t know Mered’s wife, Lidya Tesfu, he had once corresponded with her on Facebook. Tesfu told me that she and Berhe had never met. But he had thought that she looked attractive in pictures, and in 2015 he started flirting with her online. She told him that she was married, but he persisted, and so she shut him down, saying, “I don’t need anyone but my husband.” When the prosecutors filed this exchange into evidence, they omitted everything except Tesfu’s final message, creating the opposite impression—that she was married to Berhe and was pining for him. Like so many others in Khartoum, Berhe had hoped to make it to Europe. His Internet history included a YouTube video of migrants in the Sahara and a search about the conditions in the Mediterranean. The prosecutors treated this as further evidence that he was a smuggler. Worse, in a text message to his sister, he mentioned a man named Ermias; a smuggler of that name had launched the boat that sunk off the coast of Lampedusa. By the end of the interrogation, it hardly mattered whether the man in custody was Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe or Medhanie Yehdego Mered. Berhe was returned to his cell. “The important thing is the evidence, not the identity,” Ferrara told me. “It only matters that you can demonstrate that that evidence led to that person.” The N.C.A. removed from its Web site the announcement of Mered’s arrest. This was the first extradition following a fragile new anti-smuggling partnership between European and East African governments, known as the Khartoum Process. There have been no extraditions since. Within the Eritrean community, Estefanos told me, “everyone was, like, ‘What a lucky guy—we went through the Sahara and the Mediterranean, and this guy came by private airplane!’ Everybody thought he would be released in days.” Instead, the judge allowed Berhe’s case to proceed to trial. It was as if the only people who were unwilling to accept his innocence were those in control of his fate. Toward the end of the preliminary hearing, one of the prosecutors had asked Berhe if he had ever been to Libya. In the audio recording, he says “No.” But in the official transcript someone wrote “Yes.”

Tondo and Kingsley wrote in the Guardian that the trial “risks becoming a major embarrassment for both Italian and British police.” Tondo told me that, the night after the article’s publication, “I got a lot of calls from friends and family members. They were really worried about the consequences of the story.” Tondo’s livelihood relied largely on his relationship with officials at the magistrate’s office, many of whom frequently gave him confidential documents. “That’s something that began during the Mafia wars, when you could not really trust the lawyers who were defending mobsters,” he said. Tondo was thirty-four, with a wife and a two-year-old son; working as a freelancer for Italian and international publications, he rarely earned more than six hundred euros a month. “I survived through journalism awards,” he said. “So what the fuck am I going to do”—drop the story or follow where it led? “Every journalist in Sicily has asked that sort of question. You’re at the point of jeopardizing your career for finding the truth.” In Italy, investigative journalists are often wiretapped, followed, and intimidated by the authorities. “The investigative tools that prosecutors use to put pressure on journalists are the same ones that they use to track criminals,” Piero Messina, a Sicilian crime reporter, told me. Two years ago, Messina published a piece, in L’Espresso , alleging that a prominent doctor had made threatening remarks to a public official about the daughter of Paolo Borsellino, one of the anti-Mafia prosecutors who was killed in 1992. Messina was charged with libel, a crime that can carry a prison sentence of six years. According to the Italian press-freedom organization Ossigeno per l’Informazione, in the past five years Italian journalists have faced at least four hundred and thirty-two “specious defamation lawsuits” and an additional thirty-seven “specious lawsuits on the part of magistrates.” At a court hearing, Messina was presented with transcripts of his private phone calls. “When a journalist discovers that he’s under investigation in this way, he can’t work anymore” without compromising his sources, Messina told me. Police surveillance units sometimes park outside his house and monitor his movements. “They fucked my career,” he said. Messina’s trial is ongoing, and he is struggling to stay afloat. A few months ago, La Repubblica paid him seven euros for a twelve- hundred-word article on North Korean spies operating in Rome. “The pay is so low that it’s suicide to do investigative work,” he told me. “This is how information in Italy is being killed. You lose the aspiration to do your job. I know a lot of journalists who became chefs.” Prosecutors have wide latitude to investigate possible crimes, even if nothing has been reported to the police, and they are required to formally register an investigation only when they are ready to press charges. In a recent essay, Michele Caianiello, a criminal-law professor at the University of Bologna, wrote that the capacity to investigate people before any crime is discovered “makes it extremely complicated to check ex post facto if the prosecutor, negligently or maliciously, did not record in the register the name of the possible suspect”—meaning that, in practice, prosecutors can investigate their perceived opponents indefinitely, without telling anyone. In 2013, the Italian government requested telephone data from Vodafone more than six hundred thousand times. That year, Italian courts ordered almost half a million live interceptions. Although wiretaps are supposed to be approved by a judge, there are ways to circumvent the rules. One method is to include the unofficial target’s phone number in a large pool of numbers—perhaps a set of forty disposable phones that have suspected links to a Mafia boss. “It’s a legitimate investigation, but you throw in the number of someone who shouldn’t be in it,” an Italian police-intelligence official told me. “They do this all the time.” Tondo continued reporting on the Medhanie trial, embarrassing the prosecutors every few weeks with new stories showing that the wrong man might be in jail. At one of Berhe’s hearings, a man wearing a black jacket and hat followed Tondo around the courthouse, taking pictures of him with a cell phone. Tondo confronted the stranger, pulling out his own phone and photographing him in return, and was startled when the man addressed him by name. After the incident, Tondo drafted a formal complaint, but he was advised by a contact in the military police not to submit it; if he filed a request to know whether he was under investigation, the prosecutors would be notified of his inquiry but would almost certainly not have to respond to it. “In an organized-crime case, you can investigate completely secretly for years,” Ferrara told me. “You never inform them.” A few months later, the man with the black hat took the witness stand; he was an investigative police officer. “First, I’ll read the minutes from your last weddings.” Tondo makes a significant portion of his income working as a fixer for international publications. I met him last September, four months after Berhe’s arrest, when I hired him to help me with a story about underage Nigerian girls who are trafficked to Europe for sex work. We went to the Palermo magistrate to collect some documents on Nigerian crime, and entered the office of Maurizio Scalia, the deputy chief prosecutor. “Pardon me, Dr. Scalia,” Tondo said. He began to introduce me, but Scalia remained focussed on him. “You’ve got balls, coming in here,” he said. This spring, a Times reporter contacted Ferrara for a potential story about migration. Ferrara, who knew that she was working with Tondo on another story, threatened the paper, telling her, “If Lorenzo Tondo gets a byline with you, the New York Times is finished with the Palermo magistrate.” (Ferrara denies saying this.)

One afternoon in Palermo, I had lunch with Francesco Viviano, a sixty-eight-year-old Sicilian investigative reporter who says that he has been wiretapped, searched, or interrogated by the authorities “eighty or ninety times.” After decades of reporting on the ways in which the Mafia influences Sicilian life, Viviano has little patience for anti-Mafia crusaders who exploit the Cosa Nostra’s historic reputation in order to buoy their own. “The Mafia isn’t completely finished, but it has been destroyed,” he said. “It exists at around ten or twenty per cent of its former power. But if you ask the magistrates they say, ‘No, it’s at two hundred per cent,’ ” to frame the public perception of their work as heroic. He listed several public figures whose anti-Mafia stances disguised privately unscrupulous behavior. “They think they’re Falcone and Borsellino,” he said. In recent decades, Palermo’s anti-Mafia division has served as a pipeline to positions in Italian and European politics. In December, 2014, Sergio Lari, a magistrate from the Sicilian hill town of Caltanissetta, who had worked with Falcone and Borsellino and solved Borsellino’s murder, was nominated for the position of chief prosecutor in Palermo. But Francesco Lo Voi, a less experienced candidate, was named to the office. The following year, Lari began investigating a used-car dealership in southern Sicily. He discovered that its vehicles were coming from a dealership in Palermo that had been seized by the state for having links to the Mafia. Lari informed Lo Voi’s office, which started wiretapping the relevant suspects and learned that the scheme led back to a judge working inside the Palermo magistrate: Silvana Saguto, the head of the office for seized Mafia assets. “Judge Saguto was considered the Falcone for Mafia seizures,” Lari told me. “She was in all the papers. She stood out as a kind of heroine.” Lari’s team started wiretapping Saguto’s line. Saguto was tipped off, and she and her associates stopped talking on the phone. “At this point, I had to make a really painful decision,” Lari said. “I had to send in my guys in disguise, in the middle of the night, into the Palermo Palace of Justice, to bug the offices of magistrates. This was something that had never been done in Italy.” Lari and his team uncovered a vast corruption scheme, which resulted in at least twenty indictments. Among the suspects are five judges, an anti-Mafia prosecutor, and an officer in Italy’s Investigative Anti-Mafia Directorate. Saguto was charged with seizing businesses under dubious circumstances, appointing relatives to serve as administrators, and pocketing the businesses’ earnings or distributing them among colleagues, family, and friends. In one instance, according to Lari’s twelve-hundred-page indictment, Saguto used stolen Mafia assets to pay off her son’s professor to give him passing grades. (Saguto has denied all accusations; her lawyers have said that she has “never taken a euro.”) Lari refused to talk to me about other prosecutors in the Palermo magistrate’s office, but the police-intelligence official told me that “at least half of them can’t say they didn’t know” about the scheme. Lari said that Saguto was running “an anti-Mafia mafia” out of her office at the Palace of Justice. Except for Lari, every prosecutor who worked with Falcone and Borsellino has either retired or died. The Saguto investigation made Lari “many enemies” in Sicilian judicial and political circles, he said. “Before, the mafiosi hated me. Now it’s the anti-mafiosi. One day, you’ll find me dead in the street, and no one will tell you who did it.”

The investigations of the Palermo magistrate didn’t prevent its prosecutors from interfering with Calantropo’s preparations for Berhe’s defense. A week after the preliminary hearing, he applied for permission from a local prefecture to conduct interviews inside a migrant-reception center in the town of Siculiana, near Agrigento, where he hoped to find Eritreans who would testify that Berhe wasn’t Mered. Days later, Ferrara, Scalia, and Camilleri wrote a letter to the prefecture, instructing its officers to report back on whom Calantropo talked to. Calantropo, after hearing that the Eritreans had been moved to another camp, decided not to go. “It’s not legal for them to monitor the defense lawyer,” Calantropo said. “But if you observe his witnesses then you observe the lawyer.” Calantropo is calm and patient, but, like many Sicilians, he has become so cynical about institutional corruption and dubious judicial practices that he is sometimes inclined to read conspiracy into what may be coincidence. “I can’t be sure that they are investigating me,” he told me, raising an eyebrow and tilting his head in a cartoonish performance of skepticism. “But, I have to tell you, they’re not exactly leaving me alone to do my job.” Last summer, Meron Estefanos brought Yonas and another Eritrean refugee, named Ambes, from Sweden to Palermo. Both men had lived in Mered’s connection house in Tripoli in 2013. After they gave witness statements to Calantropo, saying that they had been smuggled by Mered and had never seen the man who was on trial, Tondo contacted Scalia and Ferrara. “I was begging them to meet our sources,” Tondo recalled. “But they told us, ‘We already got Mered. He’s in jail.’ ” (Estefanos, Calantropo, Yonas, and Ambes remember Tondo’s calls; Ferrara says that they didn’t happen.) Although Mered is reputed to have sent more than thirteen thousand Eritreans to Italy, the prosecutors seem to have made no real effort to speak with any of his clients. The Glauco investigations and prosecutions were carried out almost entirely by wiretapping calls, which allowed officials to build a web of remote contacts but provided almost no context or details about the suspects’ lives—especially the face-to-face transactions that largely make up the smuggling business. As a result, Ali, Mered’s Libyan boss, is hardly mentioned in the Glauco documents. When asked about him, Ferrara said that he didn’t know who he was. Ambes showed me a photograph that he had taken of Ali on his phone. After Yonas and Ambes returned to Sweden, the Palermo magistrate asked police to look into them. E.U. law requires that asylum claims be processed in the first country of entry, but after disembarking in Sicily both men had continued north, to Sweden, before giving their fingerprints and their names to the authorities. Investigating them had the effect of scaring off other Eritreans who might have come forward. “I don’t believe that they are out there to get the truth,” Estefanos said, of the Italian prosecutors. “They would rather prosecute an innocent person than admit that they were wrong.” Calantropo submitted into evidence Berhe’s baptism certificate, which he received from his family; photos of Berhe as a child; Berhe’s secondary-school report card; Berhe’s exam registration in seven subjects, with an attached photograph; and a scan of Berhe’s government-issued I.D. card. Berhe’s family members also submitted documents verifying their own identities. Other documents established Berhe’s whereabouts. His graduation bulletin shows that in 2010, while Mered was smuggling migrants through Sinai, he was completing his studies at a vocational school in Eritrea. An official form from the Ministry of Health says that in early 2013—while Mered was known to be in Libya—Berhe was treated for an injury he sustained in a “machine accident,” while working as a carpenter. The owner of Thomas Gezae Dairy Farming, in Asmara, wrote a letter attesting that, from May, 2013, until November, 2014—when Mered was running the connection house in Tripoli—Berhe was a manager of sales and distribution. Gezae wrote, “Our company wishes him good luck in his future endeavors.” Last fall, one of Berhe’s sisters travelled to the prison from Norway, where she has asylum, to visit him and introduce him to her newborn son. But she was denied entry. Only family members can visit inmates, and although her last name is also Berhe, the prison had him registered as Medhanie Yehdego Mered. “It’s not you, Adam. It’s men.” Last December, the government of Eritrea sent a letter to Calantropo, confirming that the man in custody was Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe. “It’s very strange that the European police never asked the Eritrean government for the identity card of Medhanie Yehdego Mered,” Calantropo said. (Ferrara said that Italy did not have a legal-assistance treaty with Eritrea.) When I asked Calantropo why he didn’t do that himself, he replied, “I represent Berhe. I can only ask on behalf of my client.” The prosecution has not produced a single witness who claims that Berhe is Mered. Instead, Ferrara has tried to prove that Mered uses numerous aliases, one of which may be Berhe. A few years ago, Ferrara turned a low-level Eritrean smuggler named Nuredine Atta into a state witness. After he agreed to testify, “we put him under protection, exactly like Mafia cases,” and reduced his sentence by half, Ferrara said. Long before Berhe’s arrest, Atta was shown the photograph of Medhanie Yehdego Mered wearing a cross. He said that he recalled seeing the man on a beach in Sicily in 2014, and that someone had told him that the man’s name was Habtega Ashgedom. In court, he couldn’t keep his story straight. In a separate smuggling investigation, prosecutors in Rome discounted Atta’s testimony about Mered as unreliable. After the extradition, Atta was shown a photo of Berhe. “I don’t recognize him,” he said. Later, on the witness stand, he testified that he was pretty sure he’d seen a photo of Berhe at a wedding in Khartoum, in 2013—contradicting Berhe’s claim that he had been selling milk in Asmara at the time. Berhe’s family, however, produced a marriage certificate and photographs, proving that the wedding had been in 2015, in keeping with the time line that Berhe had laid out. In court, Ferrara treated the fact that Atta didn’t know Mered or Berhe as a reason to believe that they might be the same person. Ferrara is also trying to link Berhe’s voice to wiretaps of Mered. The prosecution had Berhe read phrases transcribed from Mered’s calls, which they asked a forensic technician named Marco Zonaro to compare with the voice from the calls. Zonaro used software called Nuance Forensics 9.2. But, because it didn’t have settings for Tigrinya, he carried out the analysis with Egyptian Arabic, which uses a different alphabet and sounds nothing like Tigrinya. Zonaro wrote that Egyptian Arabic was “the closest geographical reference population” to Eritrea. The tests showed wildly inconsistent results. Zonaro missed several consecutive hearings; when he showed up, earlier this month, Ferrara pleaded with the judge to refer the case to a different court, meaning that Zonaro didn’t end up testifying, and that the trial will begin from scratch in September. Many of the wiretapped phone calls that were submitted into evidence raise questions about the limits of Italian jurisdiction. According to Gioacchino Genchi, one of Italy’s foremost experts on intercepted calls and data traffic, the technological options available to prosecutors far exceed the legal ones. When both callers are foreign and not on Italian soil, and they aren’t plotting crimes against Italy, the contents of the calls should not be used in court. “But in trafficking cases there are contradictory verdicts,” he said. “Most of the time, the defense lawyers don’t know how to handle it.” Genchi compared prosecutorial abuses of international wiretaps to fishing techniques. “When you use a trawling net, you catch everything,” including protected species, he said. “But, if the fish ends up in your net, you take it, you refrigerate it, and you eat it.”

On May 16th, having found the number and the address of Lidya Tesfu, Mered’s wife, in Italian court documents, I met her at a café in Sweden. She told me that she doesn’t know where her husband is, but he calls her once a month, from a blocked number. “He follows the case,” she said. “I keep telling him we have to stop this: ‘You have to contact the Italians.’ ” I asked Tesfu to urge her husband to speak with me. Earlier this month, he called. In the course of three hours, speaking through an interpreter, Mered detailed his activities, his business woes, and—with some careful omissions—his whereabouts during the past seven years. His version of events fits with what I learned about him from his former clients, from his wife, and from what was both present in and curiously missing from the Italian court documents—though he quibbled over details that hurt his pride (that Ali had slapped him) or could potentially hurt him legally (that he was ever armed). Mered told me that in December, 2015, he was jailed under a different name for using a forged Eritrean passport. He wouldn’t specify what country he was in, but his brother’s wiretapped call—the one that referred to Mered’s pending return from Dubai—suggests that he was probably caught in the United Arab Emirates. Six months later, when Berhe was arrested in Khartoum, Mered learned of his own supposed extradition to Italy from rumors circulating in prison. In August, 2016, one of Mered’s associates managed to spring him from jail, by presenting the authorities in that country with another fake passport, showing a different nationality—most likely Ugandan—and arranging Mered’s repatriation to his supposed country of origin. His time in prison explains why the Italian wiretaps on his Sudanese number picked up nothing in the months before Berhe was arrested; it also explains why, when the Italians asked Facebook to turn over Mered’s log-in data, there was a gap during that period."
404,http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/how-one-of-the-last-american-typewriter-companies-survives,newyorker,A Prisoner’s Only Writing Machine,[],"Kenneth Foster, Jr., became a writer on death row. When he was nineteen, he drove three friends to two armed robberies in San Antonio, Texas; late that night, one of the friends shot and killed a man. Foster was in the car, approximately eighty feet away, but, under the Texas Law of Parties, he was convicted, in 1996, of capital murder. (Foster, like more than a third of the prisoners executed in Texas, is African-American.) He started writing a few years later, after he watched correctional officers forcibly remove a prisoner from his cell. “This man was gassed, wrestled down, cuffed and dragged to his fate,” he told me recently, in a letter. The prisoner was executed by lethal injection, and Foster began to grasp that, one day, the same thing would happen to him. He needed to share what he saw and felt. “I have written with everything from pen, typewriter, marker, to my own blood,” he explained. “I have written on tables, floors, on walls when I only had a crack of light, in the dark, under blinding lights.” He bought his first typewriter, a Smith Corona, around 1999, and he began writing letter after letter in an effort to stop his execution, which was set for August 30, 2007. The state kept death-row prisoners in solitary confinement, or “seg,” and, alone in his cell, Foster began to think of his typewriter as a companion. He recalled: Regardless that I’ve had countless of these cheap machines each one is “baby.” The receiver of my affection and attention. Without “her” I didn’t feel complete. With “her” I felt like I was on a DELL in an office somewhere in upper Manhattan. While guys spent time in these Seg cells calling out chess moves over the walkways or doing push-ups until their veins bulged from their temples, I was in my cell pecking away trying to create a different world for myself. Some kind of way I felt I could rewrite my future. In Texas, before prisoners are put to death, the seven-member Board of Pardons and Paroles reviews their applications for clemency one last time. On August 30th, Foster saw his wife and grandfather, and, in a small act of protest against capital punishment, he refused to eat a final meal. Then his father arrived. “Six to one!” he shouted, ecstatic. The board had read Foster’s typewritten application and voted to recommend that his death sentence be commuted to life in prison. An hour later, Governor Rick Perry called off the execution. Foster said that as soon as he was sent back to a prison cell, he resumed writing. In the years that followed, many prisons began to regulate typewriters. When Foster’s typewriter broke a few years ago, he discovered that the commissary stocked only clear-plastic machines made by Swintec. This model often broke, he said, but he depended on it. “Buttons stop working, centering goes off,” he told me. It costs two hundred and twenty-five dollars. “That’s a ludicrous price to pay for such junk, but for a person that produces as much material as myself it is absolutely necessary.”

Just across I-95 from New York City, in a light-industrial patch of Moonachie, New Jersey, a one-story building houses the headquarters of the Swintec Corporation, the nation’s sole supplier of clear typewriters. Eighty-five people used to work in the office; fewer than ten do today. Among them is Ed Michael, Swintec’s prison-sales manager. He joined the company in 1985. “We didn’t think about the prison market until the early two-thousands,” he told me. “We had no sense of the amount of business that was available.” Swintec started out as a supplier of office devices like shredders and adding machines, but the rise of personal computing cut deeply into its profits. Then Swintec employees realized that PCs weren’t making it into prisons: few American prisons permit computers, and many require that electronics be constructed out of transparent plastic, to prevent inmates from hiding contraband inside. “It was a breakthrough,” Michael told me. At corrections conferences, guards confirmed that clear-plastic typewriters would reduce the need for tedious inspections. “It was good for them, good for us.” More than two million people are incarcerated in the United States; they represent an immense and literally captive market. In total, states spend more than fifty billion dollars a year on their correctional systems, much of which goes to private companies in the form of contracts for construction, food, medical services, phone lines, and products sold to inmates. Swintec typewriters sell modestly, on the order of three thousand to five thousand machines per year, Michael said. Each costs roughly the same as a cheap laptop. But, unlike laptops, typewriters also consume a steady stream of supplies. One catalogue sent to prisons across the U.S. sells ribbons (eight dollars), correction tape (fourteen dollars for a six-pack), and printwheels (forty-nine dollars). The handful of inmates with whom I corresponded all told me that few people in prison can afford Swintec typewriters. In that catalogue, they’re the most expensive item for sale. (A clear-plastic television is as much as eighty dollars cheaper than the cheapest Swintec.) Wages for incarcerated people can generally be measured in cents per hour. “We don’t feel that our machine is overpriced,” Michael told me, citing the costs of developing special features like spell-check and cut-and-paste. He wouldn’t say how much Swintec spends to manufacture its machines, which are shipped in from factories in Indonesia and Japan, but he did say that the company profits when prisons specifically approve their devices. “A lot of states will mandate that their inmates can only buy those types of machines,” he said. That’s one reason that a typewriter company can survive in the era of smartphones. I asked Tom Furrier, a typewriter repairman in Arlington, Massachusetts, what he thought of the price of Swintec machines, which he occasionally sells and repairs. “It might as well be a thousand dollars, to some people,” he said. “But I don’t think the cost is outrageous, by any means.” Hundreds of old-fashioned typewriters sit on shelves in Furrier’s shop. I asked him why prisoners couldn’t use refurbished machines like that. “You could almost fashion anything out of these pieces,” he told me, pointing to the steel lever arms of an Underwood. “It would be lethal, I’m sure. Almost any part in this machine.”

John J. Lennon, who is serving twenty-eight years to life for a 2001 murder, used a Swintec typewriter to become a journalist in prison. When I visited him recently, at Sing Sing Correctional Facility, in Ossining, New York, he told me that he traded his first typewriter to another prisoner for drugs. But eventually he joined a writer’s workshop run by a Hamilton College professor, Doran Larson, and a Swintec helped him write about his life: the man he killed; a stabbing he survived; the mother who had, through everything, continued to support him. Lennon’s cell has no chair, so, until recently, he would sit on an upturned bucket next to the bed, upon which he would place the typewriter. Lately, on account of back pain, he sits on the bed and rests his typewriter on his lap. “You’ll hear my typewriter going all day,” he said. Lennon’s Swintec allows him to save a maximum of seven thousand characters. “You have to get the first four pages solid, delete, then start the next four,” he told me. During periods when his typewriter is broken, he writes letters by hand, in a neat cursive scrawl. A few years ago, he asked a fellow-prisoner to tattoo a typewriter on his arm. In 2013, Lennon wrote an essay arguing that gun-control laws could have stopped him from buying the assault rifle that he had used for murder. “Despite the Xanax dulling my emotions, my heart pounded when I picked up the M-16,” he typed. “A surge of power rushed through me when I felt the trigger.” He mailed the piece to a few magazines; The Atlantic published it on its Web site. “It’s a high when you get something published,” he told me. During our conversation, he started one sentence with, “When I’m out, maybe working for a magazine.” Around us, parents played Scrabble with their incarcerated sons, and children drank soda with their incarcerated fathers. “Hopefully my third act is a little sexier than my second,” he said. Others have achieved what Lennon aspires to. In 2003, Daniel Genis, a Russian-American in his early twenties, was arrested for a string of robberies in Manhattan. In prison he wrote “Narcotica,” a novel about drug addiction, on a Swintec, and since his release he has written about incarceration for Vice and the Daily Beast. But such stories are rare. During my visit to Swintec headquarters, Ed Michael told me about Stanley (Tookie) Williams, III, a gang member who killed four people in Southern California. Michael seemed moved by the fact that, while on death row in California, Williams used a Swintec to write books for children. I asked what happened to him. “They finalized his sentence,” Michael said. “They did it. Yeah. So he’s not there anymore.”"

409,http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/trucking-as-a-state-of-mind,newyorker,Trucking as a State of Mind,[],"Finn Murphy arrived for his first day of work at Callahan Bros. Moving & Storage on May 22, 1976. He had just turned eighteen. In the fall, he would be starting at Colby College; his parents were churchgoing golfers from Cos Cob, Connecticut, who imagined a professional career for their son. Murphy had different ideas. He liked the cardboard-box smell of the Callahan office and admired the movers, who wore T-shirts brined with sweat. Later that day, he helped carry a four-hundred-pound lateral file down a set of winding stairs. When it slipped, he writes, in “ The Long Haul: A Trucker’s Tales of Life on the Road ,” its “metal edge carved a crimson serpent down the inside of my forearm.” Inspecting the cut, Murphy thought, “First blood.” He was angry with his parents and with society in general; he wanted “tough work for tough men.” At Colby, he smoked a lot of pot and conducted an independent study about the economics of the long-haul-moving industry. After his junior year, he dropped out to become a mover full time. “From now on, I’ll be the captain of my ship and the master of my soul,” he recalls thinking. “To put it another way: Screw you, everybody.”

A mood of mystery surrounds movers and truckers. Like priests, movers shepherd us through life’s transitions; like cowboys, truckers drive the roads we’ll never know. Both see America in ways the rest of us don’t. In “The Long Haul,” Murphy, who specializes in long-distance moves and drives an eighteen-wheeler, promises to bring us into his semi-mythic world. And yet Murphy himself is the book’s real mystery. In the 1970 film “Five Easy Pieces,” Jack Nicholson played Bobby Dupea, a classical pianist who gives up music to work on an oil rig. By turns, Bobby was charming and contemptuous, contemplative and enraged, wise and impulsive, truculent and loose. Murphy, another prepster gone rogue, is all of these things, too, and one spends much of the book wondering what drives him. Like Anthony Bourdain’s “ Kitchen Confidential ” and Henry Marsh’s “ Do No Harm ,” “The Long Haul” is an occupational memoir with an untold human story at its center. In crushingly hard work, Murphy seems to be escaping from himself.

Much of “The Long Haul” focusses on the mechanics of long-haul moving. It’s cyclical work that begins and ends with a trailer resembling “an operating room scrubbed for the next surgery.” In between, there’s a lot of packing, lifting, loading, and hauling. The furniture is always heavy; the driving is often terrifying; the combination darkly absurd. Early in the book, on a journey from Fairfield, Connecticut, to Aspen, Colorado, Murphy, in the Rockies, descends the twelve-thousand-foot Loveland Pass. The hairpins are covered in ice and slush. His fifty-three-foot trailer weighs twenty thousand pounds and contains furniture belonging to “a former investment banker from a former investment bank who apparently escaped the toppled citadel with his personal loot intact”—including eight six-hundred-pound Qing-dynasty tombstones. “I downshift my thirteen-speed transmission to fifth gear, slow to 23 mph, and set my Jake brake to all eight cylinders,” Murphy writes. As the brakes struggle to resist the truck’s momentum, the whole cab shudders and Murphy’s arms shake. A jackknife seems imminent. At such moments Murphy’s life resembles “Mad Max” and “Antiques Roadshow” combined.

Murphy likes “low company and hard work,” but also has a crush on Terry Gross and reads “Mansfield Park” in the sleeper of his cab. Is trucking really the right life for him? Midway through “The Long Haul,” he gets fed up with life on the road and quits. Two decades later—after he’s “washed ashore in a city out West” with “no job, no plans, no nothing”—he returns to it, determined “to approach the work with serious intellectual intention toward performing even the smallest tasks properly.” Earlier this year, in a book called “ Masters of Craft: Old Jobs in the New Urban Economy ,” the sociologist Richard Ocejo investigated why certain blue-collar jobs—butcher, barber, bartender, distiller—have become suddenly prestigious while others have not. “Why are there no ‘cool’ plumbers, electricians, or maintenance workers?” Ocejo asks. He finds that only certain kinds of work are seen as having the “philosophical underpinnings” that—once they are enacted theatrically—give manual laborers the intellectual aura of knowledge workers. At times, Murphy seems determined to unearth a philosophy of long-haul moving. His goal is to practice moving and trucking in an elevated way.

To articulate this philosophy, Murphy devotes much of “The Long Haul” to the nuances of moving. He compares loading boxes into the truck to an athletic version of Tetris. (A well-loaded trailer contains many “tiers” of furniture, with heavy items on the bottom and smaller, odd-shaped items, called “chowder,” on top; a good mover can walk around a house and build tiers in his head.) As a “boutique” mover specializing in high-end relocations, Murphy—like Don Ainsworth, the dangerous-goods trucker in John McPhee’s “ A Fleet of One ”—owns and operates his own truck. He hires his own moving teams, and, in partnership with a dispatcher, sets his own schedule—a never-ending sprint of packing, driving, and unpacking. He stays awake with the help of “Dr Cola”—a combination of Coke and Dr Pepper—and saves time and money by sleeping in his cab. Regular truckers, called “freighthaulers,” are “gearheads” who boast about their powerful trucks and look down on movers as “bedbuggers.” They are also employees of big shipping companies who often live hand to mouth. Murphy may be knee-deep in the “muddy, filth-strewn, windblown end of the American cesspit”—packing boxes in the attic of an elderly hoarder, say, with a crew of probable felons he recruited at a local bar—but he makes around two hundred thousand dollars a year. (He looks down, too, on the clichéd freighthauler aesthetic: country music, big belt buckles, tattoos.)

Out on “the big slab”—the highway—truckers are responsible for checking the connectors and couplings that link their cabs to their trailers, and for monitoring tire pressure (a big job when there are eighteen tires). In a similar way, they must maintain psychological equilibrium. Drivers find solace in loose, anonymous fellowship. In a coin-operated truckstop shower in Kittery, Maine, another trucker approaches Murphy (“Now don’t get all edgy there, driver”), introduces himself as “Lone Ranger” (his C.B. handle; Murphy’s is “U-Turn”), and shares his life story. On the road, drivers use the radio to warn each other about hazards—natural and man-made (“Kojak with a Kodak 201 sunset” means “a state trooper has a radar gun at mile-marker 201 on the westbound side”). One night in South Carolina, Murphy finds himself “running convoy” with nine other trucks. For a hundred and thirty miles, the convoy, carrying fresh flowers, steel, and hot tubs, drives sixty-five, undisturbed by “four-wheelers” (that is, by regular cars). “There was a plane of consciousness that we had together,” Murphy writes. “It’s the closest thing to a Zen experience I know except when I’m in my loading trance.”

Murphy understands himself as a chronicler of American decline. He reports that quality American furniture has disappeared—it’s been replaced by IKEA —and that no one owns books anymore. Hauling cross-country means “breezing through one dead or dying town after another” in a landscape that “looks like an episode from ‘The Walking Dead’ ”; everywhere, rings of chain stores and pawnshops surround decaying post-industrial downtowns. Murphy concludes that, outside of the big cities, university towns are the only good places left. Ruminating on American tourism posters—apple orchards in New England, porch swings down South, cowboys out West—he writes, “If a tourist poster of America were made with some verisimilitude, it would show a Subway franchise inside a convenience-store gas station with an under-paid immigrant mopping the floor and a street person at the traffic light holding a cardboard sign that reads ANYTHING HELPS .”"
410,http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/literary-style-and-the-lessons-of-memoir,newyorker,Literary Style and the Lessons of Memoir,[],"In his book “Memoir: An Introduction,” from 2011, the scholar G. Thomas Couser argues that we go to the genre not so much for detail or style as for “wisdom and self-knowledge,” for what the main character, who is always the author, has learned. Sometimes, though, the style is the lesson. Earlier this year, the Seattle poet Paul Hunter published “Clownery,” which follows Hunter from his birth in the rural Midwest, through college, marriage, fatherhood, divorce, high-school and college teaching, grease- and gear-filled shirtsleeve jobs, caregiving for an ill sister and playing with grandchildren. The chapters conclude with Hunter’s late-life meditations, “trying to keep from a lip-smacking bitterness” as he imagines “the end of the planet as a hospitable home.” Hunter published his first chapbook in 1970, and has been giving us verse about rural and wild America, and practical prose about sustainable farming, every few years since 2000. In “ Clownery ,” rather than using “I” or “me,” or naming any characters, Hunter tells his own story as that of a nameless “clown.”

This simple device has astonishing effects, making Hunter’s life at once more generic—it’s easier to see yourself in “the clown” than in “Paul Hunter”—and funnier and sadder. “One morning out in the country the little clown’s mother was washing her mother’s hair in the kitchen pantry, behind the curtain where they boiled their water and took their washtub baths,” he writes. And later: “The clown knew nothing of planning, and snagged on a nail ripped his pants. Got caught and stayed caught till he was practically naked.” The floppy-shoes aspects of puberty and old age, when we may feel at once too big and too small, too late and too early, fit the conceit almost too easily: “Aging for clowns was more of a ripening that just went on and on. . . . Clowns were born weepy with blubber lips anyhow, and pratfalls demanded lifelong practice,” Hunter writes. “Clowns were always at an awkward stage,” “hiding twitchy flat feet . . . in big shoes.” Sentence by sentence, he manages to sound like a rambling talker, a corn-fed storyteller, even though, each time you finish a page or a chapter, you realize just how elegantly assembled the volume is.

Hunter’s unusual autobiography is one of a few recent books that reinvent, or fracture, the memoir’s form. All come from small presses; all come long after the stylish, formally inventive, and popular books of the late-nineties memoir boom (Dave Eggers’s “ A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius ,” for example, and Lauren Slater’s “ Lying ”). Popular memoirs these days are more direct: it’s generally easy to say what makes the lives they chronicle stand out, so that readers and critics focus on their subjects, whether it’s Appalachia (J. D. Vance’s “ Hillbilly Elegy ”), weight, shame, and trauma (Roxane Gay’s “ Hunger ”), or plant science (Hope Jahren’s nearly perfect “ Lab Girl ”).

Yet experiments in the genre continue, many of them, like Maggie Nelson’s breakthrough book, “ The Argonauts ,” from 2015, intimately connected to the drive toward new forms, and the use of fragments and white space, in contemporary poetry. These memoirs take cues from prose poems and lyrical essays, like those in Claudia Rankine’s “Citizen.” They also use the devices of poetry—interruption, compression, extended metaphor—to pay book-length attention to individual real lives, and, not coincidentally, they come from independent publishers known for their poets and poems.

The writer Jessica Anne told the Chicago Tribune that she began her book “ A Manual for Nothing ” because “I got excited reading unclassifiable books by authors like Maggie Nelson and Lidia Yuknavitch , and I wanted to try it.” She might have fashioned from the material of her life a conventional memoir of family dysfunction and bad sexual decisions. Anne was raised—or not raised—by a mother whose series of boyfriends rivalled, in their unreliability, her series of ailments, including a struggle with terminal cancer that seems to have been imaginary. Anne attended a “Fame”-style performing-arts high school, dropped out of college, discovered feminism, travelled to London, returned to Chicago to make a career as a singer and monologuist, and settled down (with her husband) to write the book.

“A Manual for Nothing” is part collage of half- remembered facts, part tongue-in-cheek guide to womanhood, and part imaginary dialogue, with speaking parts for Shakespeare’s Cleopatra and for Patti LuPone. Its numbered propositions, many of them in the second person, some of them absurd, accrete a willful resistance to realism, even as they frame what seem to be facts from her life. From “Maroon Chart,” a short chapter about menstruation: “Ovulation stains a period’s blood red as a stage curtain. . . . Once the menstrual blood is bright, you become your father’s next of kin.” Elsewhere in the book, Anne imagines telling a boyfriend, “I thought we were forever! I thought you were the pearl onion of my special, special day!” That’s probably not what she said at the time.

The dismemberment of a life into lists—one of the chapters comprises thirty-three short noun phrases—lets Anne frame events that must have terrified her at the time (her mother’s feigned cancer, for example) not as the most important moments in her life but as material to be assimilated, made into something just inches away from a joke. An unwanted sexual experience is “not quite rape, it’s just one of those awkward nights to giggle and gossip over. . . . Everyone’s laughing at you. Don’t cry.” In order to free herself from her past, and to push back against patriarchy’s expectations—so her chopped-up form suggests—she has to generalize, to satirize, to cut her life story into bits that she can crumple or rearrange. Paul Hunter learns equanimity by presenting his life as the life of a circus clown; Jessica Anne learns to imagine control.

The Brooklyn songwriter and poet Jasmine Dreame Wagner, in her own recent memoir, “ On a Clear Day ,” learns to notice particularity—and to get outside her own wish to generalize, to let big theories explain her life. “On a Clear Day” is a capacious book of traveller’s observations, cultural criticism, and quarter-life-crisis notes about deserts, gallery art, and Brooklyn bohemians in our “golden era of listicles.” It’s the kind of book that tries to take the temperature of a generation (Wagner’s first book appeared in 2012) or at least of a generation’s narrow, gallery-going, artsy urban slice. In Wagner’s Brooklyn, “the cacophony of lo-fi indie rock reverb” is also “the sound of gentrification, “the sound of if only ,” “the sound of why me .” Throughout the volume, Wagner puts her name-checked role models (Didion, Deleuze, C. D. Wright, Leslie Jamison) to clever use.

Learning from poets’ sharply quotable lines, and from travel writers’ set pieces and first-person assertions, Wagner has made a book to dip into, open almost at random, or get lost in. In this respect, the book resembles, as she knows, the endless branching paths of social media, which become her subject: “my method of describing the sunset, its noise, is likewise noise. Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr.” Fragmentary prose, composed of disconnected observations and advice, goes back as far as the Bible, but Wagner’s combination of patience and jumpiness, and her search for “the real, presence, materiality” in snippets that keep slipping away from her, seem to fit our age of distraction and hyper-alertness, when we might look up from Proust, or from the Grand Canyon, to see if we’ve been retweeted, or liked, or tagged.

Wagner presents the sublimity of deserts, the welcome alienation of new sites, “the wind’s ripples in the dunes, the dunes’ ripples on the tectonic plate,” almost as a more conventional travelogue would. But her wish to say what she sees works at startling cross-purposes with her critic’s wish to generalize—it is as if she were grasping both for the high-level wisdom that G. Thomas Couser seeks in all memoir and for the ground-level immediacy that Joseph Conrad sought when he said that he wrote fiction “above all, to make you see.” Some gallery artists face the same dilemma: should they focus on visual experience, or on difficult abstract ideas? Sometimes, Wagner manages to follow both Couser and Conrad at once. Her description of winter in the suburbs, for instance, treats the snow as a tangible symbol for—but also as an alternative to—abstraction: “snow blots out the words on the strip mall marquee. It has no part. It speaks of no prior experience . . . . Like chicks swollen in our shells, we must scrape through its opacity to release ourselves.”

That line implies—in harmony with almost all memoirs, but against the grain of some poets—that we still have selves to release. Wagner seems to believe that, but she doesn’t take it for granted: she worries, and who wouldn’t, that the speaking self these days is too like an advertisement, or a means of self-aggrandizement. In her crowded Brooklyn, “in order to secure a voice equal to those of corporations . . . people become brands,” flaunting “the qualities of successful brands, such as media visibility [and] message consistency.” Sell yourself, in other words, or get erased. It’s a grim conclusion for the tradition of memoir, from St. Augustine to our time, and it’s a conclusion that Wagner’s canny fragments, like Anne’s sarcastic lists and Hunter’s tender metaphors, refuse. “The closer I come to my own erasure,” she writes of her time in the Southwestern deserts, “the stronger my work’s urge / to story… If my language is obscure / I’ll vanish in its steam.”"
411,http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson-sorkin/when-anthony-scaramucci-fell-in-love-with-donald-trump,newyorker,When Anthony Scaramucci Fell in Love with Donald Trump,[],"“Jake, I don’t care,” Anthony Scaramucci, Donald Trump’s new communications director , told Jake Tapper on Sunday, on CNN’s “ State of the Union .” Scaramucci added, “You know who doesn’t care? The President doesn’t care.” It was a line, and a sentiment, that Scaramucci has repeated often, in one form or another, over the past few days; there seems to be a lot that neither man cares about. In this instance, Scaramucci didn’t care about what Tapper suggested was an extravagant act of hypocrisy on his part. During the Republican primaries, Scaramucci had written a column for the Fox Business Network Web site warning against demagoguery and xenophobia, and saying that the G.O.P. faced “a moral debt restructuring, one caused by the reckless behavior of a man who knows a thing or two about bankruptcy.” Tapper, reasonably enough, took this to have been a criticism of the man who is now Scaramucci’s boss, and asked how many positions and principles Scaramucci was willing to renounce in return for a White House office. Scaramucci had already deleted tweets in which he’d declared himself pro-choice, pro gun control, and opposed to the conspiracy theories of climate-change denialists. Tapper suggested that people might think, “Wow, this guy is willing to suppress everything he believes in order to get close to power.” “Nonsense,” Scaramucci said. The whole question, to his mind, embodied everything that was wrong with Washington. He then compared himself to Winston Churchill and Ronald Reagan. He also mentioned that Trump had called him from Air Force One—what that was supposed to explain wasn’t clear—and that he loved the President.

Perhaps Scaramucci admires Trump’s knowledge of bankruptcy, perhaps especially moral bankruptcy, not as a degraded state but one in which some unprofitable principles can be written off and new, more marketable ones acquired. Scaramucci has a background in finance, and is currently disentangling himself from SkyBridge Capital, a fund that invests in other funds; Forbes estimated that a sale of his stake might yield close to eighty million dollars . (He also had a career in media, alongside his business ventures, as a host of shows like “Wall Street Week,” on the Fox Business Network.) Or maybe, as he told Tapper, he just saw the light during the campaign and realized that Trump would be “phenomenal” for America, and thus came by his flashy obsequiousness honestly, at least once other candidates he’d preferred, such as Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, had dropped out. It doesn’t entirely matter. This Administration is such an ethical morass that one can get lost wondering about the state of everybody’s soul. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, for example, had always openly loved Donald Trump, who is now doing his best to squish what is left of Sessions’s self-respect, by saying that he ought never to have hired him. Sessions apparently lost Trump’s affection by not acting to protect him from the many investigations into Russia’s role in the 2016 Presidential election.

Scaramucci is doing his best to make up for that lapse. When Tapper asked him about the investigation, he offered up the novel theory that, if the Russians had really been up to something, we would never have known—“they’re super confident in their deception skills in hacking”—and thus the existence of evidence that they were, say, reaching out to the Trump campaign was actually proof that they were not. Scaramucci didn’t take credit for coming up with that one himself; he was repeating something “somebody said to me yesterday, I won’t tell you who.”

“I don’t know who this anonymous person is. . . .” Tapper protested.

“How about, how about it was the, how about it was the President, Jake?” Scaramucci said, with what, for reasons we may never understand, sounded like a note of triumph. The revelation of his source was bolstered by yet another reference to a communication from on high: “He called me from Air Force One.”

Scaramucci appears to believe that if he expresses enough delight in name-dropping and what his boss calls his “braggadocio”—playing up his persona as the Long Island guy who made good in Manhattan, known to friends and foes alike as “the Mooch”—it will come across as charming, or at least provide enough of a distraction to pass for an answer. When Tapper asked him if the President could pardon himself (Trump has reportedly asked his lawyers about this, and tweeted over the weekend that Presidential-pardon powers have no limit), Scaramucci said that he didn’t know. But, he added, “I took constitutional law from Larry Tribe”—a professor at Harvard Law School, which, as Scaramucci had already mentioned, he attended—“and if Professor Tribe is listening, I know he doesn’t like the President, but I did get an A-minus in your course.” Pressed on the question of pardon power, Scaramucci said that it “doesn’t matter anyway, because that is another one of those stupid hypotheticals. He’s not going to have to pardon himself, because he’s done absolutely nothing wrong. So, we don’t even have to worry about it.""

There are likely to be many craven, circular answers of this kind in a Scaramucci-run communications operation. On Friday, in his first engagement with the press, Scaramucci was asked whether he stood by Trump’s assertion that three million illegal votes were cast in the 2016 election. “So, if the President says it, let me do more research on it, but my guess is that there’s probably some level of truth to that,” Scaramucci said. It wasn’t clear that the press could expect that research to extend much further than into whether the President had said it and still believed it. It only underscored the question of what the press, or the public, could expect from Scaramucci.

Radical honesty doesn’t seem like an option. Neither does actually useful information on the workings of the executive branch, or of Congress. When he was asked, on Friday, why he believed that the President would get “a win” on health care, he said, “The President has really good karma, O.K.? And the world turns back to him. He’s genuinely a wonderful human being, and I think, as the members of Congress get to know him better and get comfortable with him, they’re going to let him lead them to the right things for the American people. So, I think we’re going to get the health care done.” Despite lines like that, there is a theory that Scaramucci will offer, if nothing else, lively engagement and coherent sentences—a contrast, in other words, to Sean Spicer , the increasingly gloomy press secretary who fled the building on news of Scaramucci’s appointment. For a while, watching Spicer was edifying in a backward sort of way, in that his flailing made the senselessness of the President’s positions manifest. But watching him had begun to feel a little cruel, his humiliation by the White House too deliberate. On Friday, Scaramucci offered a last jab when he said, of Spicer, “I love the guy, and I wish him well, and I hope he goes on to make a tremendous amount of money.”

Money: maybe then Trump would respect poor Spicer. It was a way of reminding everyone in the room that money was something that Scaramucci already has. In the Trump White House, though, he may be surprised at how little it buys him, and at what price."

The order, which the Girls Scouts were granted on Monday night, prevents Trump from coming within three hundred feet of any gathering of the Scouts’ organization.

Carol Foyler, a Girl Scouts spokesperson, said that while the G.S.U.S.A. sought the restraining order “out of an abundance of caution,” the girls themselves were “in no way, shape or form” afraid of President Trump.

“They’re prepared to deal with bobcats and bears,” she said. “They can handle a malignant narcissist.”

Trump wasted little time responding to the Girl Scouts’ action, lashing out at the organization in a blistering early-morning tweet storm.

“Failing Girl Scouts bad (or sick) guys,” Trump wrote. “Mints, cookies terrible. Sad!”"

If this motion, which called on the Senate to take up discussion of the health-care bill that the House of Representatives passed in May, had been defeated, the repeal effort would likely have been finished. But McConnell and his colleagues managed to cobble together just enough votes to keep their ambitions alive.

The swing vote was cast by Shelley Moore Capito, the junior senator from West Virginia, who, last week, had joined with two of her Republican colleagues, Maine’s Susan Collins and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, to block McConnell’s idea of having a vote solely on repealing the A.C.A., without putting in place any replacement measures. If Capito had stuck with Collins and Murkowski, both of whom voted against the procedural motion on Tuesday, it, too, would have failed. But, after meeting with Donald Trump in her home state on Monday, Capito put party loyalty before the interests of her constituents, about a third of whom are on Medicaid.

The vote was also marked by the dramatic appearance of John McCain, who returned to the Senate for the first time since being diagnosed with brain cancer. After receiving a standing ovation from his colleagues, McCain cast a vote in favor of McConnell’s motion, and then spoke from the floor of the Senate with great passion. After referring to his thirty-year career in the Senate, and his work with politicians of widely divergent views from both parties, he went on:

I hope we can again rely on humility, on our need to coöperate, on our dependence on each other to learn how to trust each other again and by so doing better serve the people who elected us. Stop listening to the bombastic loudmouths on the radio and television and the Internet. To hell with them. They don’t want anything done for the public good. Our incapacity is their livelihood.

Let’s trust each other. Let’s return to regular order. We’ve been spinning our wheels on too many important issues because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle. That’s an approach that’s been employed by both sides, mandating legislation from the top down, without any support from the other side, with all the parliamentary maneuvers that requires.

We’re getting nothing done. . . . We’ve tried to do this by coming up with a proposal behind closed doors in consultation with the Administration, then springing it on skeptical members, trying to convince them it’s better than nothing, asking us to swallow our doubts and force it past a unified opposition. I don’t think that is going to work in the end. And it probably shouldn’t.

These were stirring words, and they contained a lot of truth. But what good did this verbal tour de force do? In voting for McConnell’s motion, McCain participated in precisely the sort of cynical partisan political maneuver that he inveighed against. For months now, McConnell has been scheming to shove through a monumentally consequential reform without any hearings, markups, or efforts to reach out to Democrats. After last week, when this scheming looked destined to fail, he called for Tuesday’s vote on the “motion to consider”—even though he had not made clear what sort of measure the members would be taking up.

McCain supported McConnell’s motion. In doing so, he helped enable the Majority Leader to pursue his fallback strategy: getting practically any sort of measure passed and tossing the details of reform over to a Senate-House conference, which would deliberate in secrecy, with little input from anyone outside the G.O.P. leadership.

The Senate is now set to vote on three bills that have practically no chance of getting fifty-one votes: a repeal-only bill; the “repeal-and-replace” bill that McConnell originally proposed; and a revised version of the McConnell bill that includes an amendment from Ted Cruz, of Texas, which would allow insurers to sell cheap catastrophic-insurance policies outside of the Obamacare exchanges. After these votes are held, McConnell is expected to propose a so-called “skinny” repeal bill, which calls for the repeal of the individual and employer mandates but leaves everything else to be decided by the House-Senate conference.

If he had been following his own advice, McCain would have broken with McConnell and voted against the motion. If the motion had failed, the Republican leadership would have had little choice but to start talks with the Democrats about patching up the Obamacare insurance exchanges and, perhaps, making modest changes to Medicaid. Indeed, earlier this month, after McConnell’s repeal-and-replace bill failed to garner the support of fifty-one Republicans, Lamar Alexander, the chairman of the Senate health committee, announced plans to convene bipartisan hearings on ways to stabilize the individual-insurance markets. Now that McConnell’s motion has passed, such plans are in abeyance.

To be sure, this is only an interim victory for the Republican leadership: the ultimate outcome of their repeal efforts remains uncertain. Even if McConnell succeeds in punting the ball over to a House-Senate conference, the full Senate will eventually have to vote on a final piece of legislation, which will have specific terms that can be analyzed and discussed. Getting a final bill passed won’t be easy.

For now, though, the G.O.P. campaign against Obamacare is still alive, and it owes its life to subterfuge. In the House, Speaker Paul Ryan managed to assemble a majority for his bill only by persuading his colleagues that any flaws it contained would be fixed in the Senate. That didn’t happen. Instead, McConnell now wants to abdicate the Senate’s deliberative responsibilities and kick things back to the House.

As McCain noted, these “responsibilities are important, vitally important, to the continued success of our Republic. And our arcane rules and customs are deliberately intended to require broad coöperation to function well at all. The most revered members of this institution accepted the necessity of compromise in order to make incremental progress on solving America’s problems and to defend her from her adversaries.”

For his long record of service to the country, his bravery, and his acerbic streak, McCain is himself widely revered. It is a great pity, indeed a tragedy, that he and many other Republican senators didn’t act upon his words."
415,http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1966/01/22/among-the-wild-things,newyorker,Maurice Sendak’s Wild Things,[],"As I studied the pictures of Max and his companions, it seemed to me that I had never seen fantasy depicted in American children’s books in illustrations that were so powerfully in motion. Brian O’Doherty, the former art critic of the Times , has written that Sendak is “a fantasist in the great tradition of Sir John Tenniel and Edward Lear,” and I agree. O’Doherty has also described Sendak as “one of the most powerful men in the United States,” in that he “has given shape to the fantasies of millions of children—an awful responsibility.” I had known a few men who possessed power, but never this kind of power, so I made arrangements to meet the creator of the wild things.

In the past few years, I have become increasingly interested in Sendak’s work, reading his books for my own pleasure as well as for the amusement of my children. His drawings, I have found, are oddly compelling. Intensely, almost palpably alive, they seem to move on the page and, later, in memory. This quality is pervasive in “Where the Wild Things Are,” the story of a boy named Max who assumes a demonic face and puts on a wolf suit one night and makes mischief. His mother calls him a “ WILD THInG !” and Max answers, “ I’LL EAT YOU UP !” He is sent to bed without his supper. Standing in his room, Max watches a forest grow until it becomes the world. An ocean tumbles by with a boat in it for Max, and he sails to where the wild things are. The wild things—a colony of monsters—try to frighten Max, but, frowning fiercely, he commands them to be still. Cowed, they make Max King of the Wild Things. Then, at Max’s order, a rumpus begins—six wordless pages of howling, dancing, tree-climbing, and parading by Max and the wild things. Max presently stops the revels, though, and sends the wild things to bed without their supper, and then, feeling lonely, gives up his crown. The wild things so hate to see Max leave that they try to scare him into staying, but he is not intimidated, and he sails back to his room, where he finds his supper waiting for him.

Sendak has trouble believing in his commercial success largely because his creations are so much at variance with the sort of thing that usually sells well in his field. Far too many contemporary picture books for the young are still populated by children who eat everything on their plates, go dutifully to bed at the proper hour, and learn all sorts of useful facts or moral lessons by the time the book comes to an end. The illustrations are usually decorative rather than imaginative, and any fantasy that may be encountered either corresponds to the fulfillment of adult wishes or is carefully curbed lest it frighten the child. Many of these books, homogenized and characterless, look and read as if they had been put together by a computer. Sendak’s work, on the other hand, is unmistakably identifiable as his. He will not illustrate to order, increasingly depending on himself as the writer, and, when he illustrates the texts of others, choosing only those that seem real to him. “Maurice is not an artist who just does an occasional book for children because there’s money in it or because he thinks it will give him an easy change of pace,” Sendak’s editor, Ursula Nordstrom, who is director of the children’s book department of Harper & Row, has said. “Children’s books are all he does and all he wants to do. His books are full of emotion, of vitality. When one of his lines for a drawing is blown up, you find that it’s not a precise straight line. It’s rough with ridges, because so much emotion has gone into it. Too many of us—and I mean editors along with illustrators and writers of children’s books—are afraid of emotion. We keep forgetting that children are new and we are not. But somehow Maurice has retained a direct line to his own childhood.” Sendak, moreover, does not subscribe to the credo that childhood is a time of innocence—a point of view that, as it is usually interpreted, results in tales and pictures soothing to parents but unreal to the children. The young in Sendak’s books—particularly the books he writes himself—are sometimes troubled and lonely, they slip easily into and out of fantasies, and occasionally they are unruly and stubborn. Nor are they the bright, handsome boys and softly pretty little girls who are so numerous in so many picture books for children. The Sendak boys and girls tend to appear truncated, having oversized heads, short arms, and quite short legs.

My son’s familiarity with Maurice Sendak’s creations is shared by a sizable and constantly growing number of American children under eight. As a writer, as an illustrator, and as both, Sendak has been associated with a number of successful children’s books of the past decade. In addition to the “Little Bear” series, the “Nutshell Library,” and “Where the Wild Things Are,” there have been “A Hole Is to Dig,” written by Ruth Krauss, “The BatPoet” and “The Animal Family,” both written by the late Randall Jarrell, “Lullabies and Night Songs,” with music by Alec Wilder, and “Hector Protector.” More than fifty other children’s books contain illustrations by Sendak, and more than half a dozen have texts by him; many of them sell well enough to keep Sendak surprised by his affluence.

“Pierre!” Nicholas announced. The next jump was the most ambitious yet, and Nicholas fell off the bed. As he rubbed his knee, my wife asked, “Are you hurt?” In a much softer voice, he replied, “Yes, Mother Bear.” Mother Bear is a large, comfortable source of reassurance in “Little Bear,” a series of four books written by Else Holmelund Minarik and illustrated by Maurice Sendak. The Pierre whom Nicholas had been emulating is the hero of a book called “Pierre,” which is part of the four-volume “Nutshell Library,” written and illustrated by Maurice Sendak; Pierre, even after he is swallowed by a famished lion, will say only “I don’t care.” On top of a chest of drawers next to Nicholas’s bed is a large picture of a dancing creature with horns, sharp teeth, yellow eyes, and a scaly body. He is a wild thing—an inhabitant of “Where the Wild Things Are,” a book written and illustrated by Maurice Sendak. Some reviewers of children’s books have asserted that the wild things are frightening, but Nicholas finds them quite funny.

I looked puzzled, and Sendak smiled. “You see, I don’t believe, in a way, that the kid I was grew up into me,” he said. “He still exists somewhere, in the most graphic, plastic, physical way. It’s as if he had moved somewhere. I have a tremendous concern for him and interest in him. I communicate with him—or try to—all the time. One of my worst fears is losing contact with him.” Sendak frowned. “I don’t want this to sound coy or schizophrenic, but at least once a day I feel I have to make contact,” he went on. “The pleasures I get as an adult are heightened by the fact that I experience them as a child at the same time. Like, when autumn comes, as an adult I welcome the departure of the heat, and simultaneously, as a child would, I start anticipating the snow and the first day it will be possible to use a sled. This dual apperception does break down occasionally. That usually happens when my work is going badly. I get a sour feeling about books in general and my own in particular. The next stage is annoyance at my dependence on this dual apperception, and I reject it. Then I become depressed. When excitement about what I’m working on returns, so does the child. We’re on happy terms again. Being in that kind of contact with my childhood is vital to me, but it doesn’t make me perfectly certain I know what I’m doing in my work. Especially in books for children under six. I don’t think anyone really knows what kids that young like and what they don’t like. They’re formless, fluid creatures—like moving water. You can’t stop one of them at any one point and know exactly what’s going on. A child may react strongly to a book because it reaches him emotionally in some way the author intended. Then, again, it may be that he once saw a duck from a train window and never saw one again until he looked at the book, and though the book is rotten, he loves it because there’s a duck in it. Once in a while I encounter reactions to one of my books that make me think I may be getting some idea of what happened. From letters and from talking to parents and librarians, I’ve found out that, of the four books in the Nutshell Library, ‘Pierre’ is invariably the favorite with children. But here, too, I don’t know what level the child is reacting on. On one level, ‘Pierre’ is slapstick. Then, the text has a rhythmic quality—the repetition that kids like—and some children may be drawn mainly by that. On another level, Pierre is defiant—irrationally so, when it comes to the lion that finally eats him—and the child may enjoy a surface identification with the fun of rebellion. And, on a deeper level, Pierre is saying, ‘I’m me . I’ll be what I am and I’ll do what I want to do.’ The book that children have reacted to most strongly, though, is ‘Where the Wild Things Are.’ They wear out copies at libraries and keep rereading it at home. Some have sent me drawings of their own wild things, and they make mine look like cuddly fuzzballs. My wild things have big teeth. Some of their wild things not only have big teeth but are chewing on children. I have yet to hear of a child who was frightened by the book. Adults who are troubled by it forget that Max is having a fine time. He’s in control. And by getting his anger at his mother discharged against the wild things he’s able to come back to the real world at peace with himself. I think Max is my truest creation. Like all kids, he believes in a world where a child can skip from fantasy to reality in the conviction that both exist. One seven-year-old boy wrote me a letter.” Sendak rose, rummaged through a file folder in the bookcase, found the letter, and handed it to me. The boy had written, “How much does it cost to get to where the wild things are? If it is not too expensive my sister and I want to spend the summer there. Please answer soon.”

A Sealyham terrier came in. This, I was told, was Jennie, who was twelve years old and had a tendency to brood. Jennie has appeared in most of Sendak’s books, often looking more cheerful than she does in real life. Having sniffed at me briefly, Jennie left. Sendak lit a cigarette. As I looked at him, I found that he reminded me of the children in his books, and I told him so. “Yes, they’re all a kind of caricature of me,” he said. “They look as if they’d been hit on the head, and hit so hard they weren’t going to grow anymore. When I first started showing my work to children’s-book editors, about seventeen years ago, they didn’t encourage me, and a major reason was the kind of children I drew. One editor, I remember, told me they were too European. What she meant was that they seemed ugly to her. And even now I’ll get a letter at least twice a year from a librarian who wants to know why my children are so drab. Well, they’re not drab, but they’re not innocent of experience, either. Too many parents and too many writers of children’s books don’t respect the fact that kids know a great deal and suffer a great deal. My children also show a great deal of pleasure, but often they look defenseless, too. Being defenseless is a primary element of childhood. It’s not that I don’t see the naturalistic beauty of a child. I’m very aware of that beauty, and I could draw it. I know the proportions of a child’s body. But I am trying to draw the way children feel —or, rather, the way I imagine they feel. It’s the way I know I felt as a child.” Sendak leaned forward, and continued, “It may be that in projecting how I felt as a child onto the children I draw I’m being terribly biassed and inaccurate. But all I have to go on is what I know—not only about my childhood then but about the child I was as he exists now.”

The first day I visited his studio, Sendak, a short, shy man with dark-brown hair and green eyes, smiled after he saw me staring intently at the picture. “It’s hard to get away from her, isn’t it?” he said. “If you stay here long enough, you’ll find that her eyes follow you around the room.” He moved in front of the photograph. “Her face is unfinished—a round, beautiful child’s face—but her eyes tell you she could be forty-five years old. Such knowledge and pain are already there. I couldn’t do without her.”

Sendak, a bachelor, lives in a duplex on Ninth Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. On the street level he has a bedroom and a large living room with a piano and a profusion of bookcases, one of them reserved for first editions (he has close to two hundred) of works by Henry James. On the floor below are a spacious kitchen, a dining room with a brick fireplace, and a small studio, lit only by the lamp over Sendak’s drawing board, which is to the left of the room’s entrance. On the walls of the studio are paintings, photographs, and posters advertising art exhibits. A bookcase near the studio door contains an extensive collection of children’s books, formed largely around Sendak’s favorite illustrators: Randolph Caldecott and George Cruikshank, of nineteenth-century England; Ludwig Richter and Wilhelm Busch, of the same period in Germany; A. B. Frost and Edward Windsor Kemble, Americans who between them spanned the last half of the nineteenth century and the first three decades of this one; Ernst Kreidolf, a Swiss artist of those years; and, among contemporaries, the late Hans Fischer of Switzerland and André François of France. To the right of Sendak’s drawing board is a worktable, and above this is a pegboard supporting a swarm of objects. Among them are talismans—a brontosaurus constructed for him by a nephew, for instance—and postcard reproductions of paintings by Watteau, Goya, William Blake, and Winslow Homer; there are also a number of toys that Sendak has brought back from Europe, where he goes about every other year. Across the room from the worktable, an imposing high-fidelity unit stands on top of another bookcase, this one containing a large record collection, in which works by Mahler, Mozart, Beethoven, Wolf, Wagner, and Verdi are heavily represented. What dominates the room, however, is a huge photograph. Taken at an orphanage in Sicily, it shows a ten-year-old girl standing sidewise in front of a whitewashed wall. She is wearing a ragged white dress, a fly has alighted on her back, and she looks out into the room with enormous black eyes. Her hand is on her hip—a pose that is frequently assumed by the children in Sendak’s books.

Fantasy, I learned in subsequent visits to the studio, has been familiar terrain to Sendak from his earliest years. He was born in Brooklyn on June 10, 1928, the youngest of three children of Philip and Sarah Sendak. (His sister, Natalie, was eight when he was born, and his brother, Jack, was five.) Both parents had come to America before the First World War from Jewish shtetls , or small towns, outside Warsaw. The father, who worked in the garment district, told his children long stories based on tales he remembered from his childhood and alive with myth and fantasy. “He was a marvellous improviser, and he’d often extend a story for many nights,” Sendak recalls. “One short one I’ve always wanted to make into a book was about a child taking a walk with his father and mother. He becomes separated from them. Snow begins to fall, and the child shivers in the cold. He huddles under a tree, sobbing in terror. An enormous figure hovers over him and says, as he draws the boy up, ‘I’m Abraham, your father.’ His fear gone, the child looks up and also sees Sarah. He is no longer lost. When his parents find him, the child is dead. Those stories had something of the character of William Blake’s poems. The myths in them didn’t seem at all factitious. And they fused Jewish lore with my father’s particular way of shaping memory and desire. That one, for instance, was based on the power of Abraham in Jewish tradition as the father who was always there—a reassuring father even when he was Death. But the story was also about how tremendously my father missed his parents. Not all his tales were sombre, though. My father could be very witty, even if the humor was always on the darker side of irony.”

In addition to the tales his father told, and occasional stories told by his mother, books, to which Sendak early formed a passionate attachment, also stimulated his imagination. His sister gave him his first books—“The Prince and the Pauper” and “The Three Musketeers.” Besides being fascinated by the contents of the books, he was drawn to them as physical entities. “I can still remember the smell and feel of the bindings of those first two books,” he says. “I didn’t read them for a long time. It felt so good just having them. They seemed alive to me, and so did many other inanimate objects I was fond of. All children have these intense feelings about certain dolls or other toys. In my case, this kind of relationship, if you can call it that, was heightened because up to the age of six I spent a lot of time in bed with a series of illnesses. Being alone much of the time, I developed friendships with objects. To this day, in my parents’ home there are certain toys that I played with as a child, and when I visit my parents, I’m also visiting those toys.”

In “Kenny’s Window,” which was published in 1956, and was the first book that Sendak wrote as well as illustrated, he distilled much of his own childhood—the attachment to particular objects, the fantasy, the loneliness. Kenny wakes from a dream and remembers meeting in a garden a rooster, who gave him seven questions to answer. In the course of searching for the answers, he has serious conversations with several of his toys. Kenny is angered by a favorite Teddy bear, who reproaches him for having been left under the bed all night, but soon Kenny writes the bear a poem assuring him of his love, and that conflict is resolved. In fantasy, Kenny journeys to Switzerland and talks with a goat in order to find the answer to one of the rooster’s questions: “What is an only goat?” An only goat, Kenny finally learns, is a lonely goat who is not allowed by an overprotective master to do what he most enjoys doing. There is also a meeting, on the roof of Kenny’s house, with a talking, flying horse. Kenny resolves not to tell his parents about the horse and its ability to talk and to fly. (“They’d say it was a dream. They don’t know how to listen in the night.”) Another crisis occurs when one of Kenny’s two favorite lead soldiers reminds the other of a promise Kenny has broken—to take care of them always. The first soldier is chipped in four different places. He complains to Kenny. Enraged at being made to feel guilty, Kenny exiles the chipped soldier to the outside ledge of his window in the cold, but then he brings the soldier in again and tells him he has not broken his promise. When the rooster later asks Kenny one of the seven questions again—“Can you fix a broken promise?”—Kenny answers, “Yes, if it only looks broken, but really isn’t.”

In his adult life, Sendak’s rapport with particular inanimate objects has not been limited to the toys in Brooklyn. One afternoon, in his studio, he pointed out to me several pens on his drawing board, and said, “Some of these pens are with me, and some are against me. In a store, some look as if they want to be sold to me. Others will fight me to the end. I may antagonize some and not be able to win back their friendship, but others are less stubborn.” He picked up a small, smooth rock. “This is a friend,” he said. “I found him on a beach in Italy in 1953. He goes with me on all my trips.” Sendak looked at me somewhat warily, and added, “I suppose that sounds strange.” Since I have similar feelings about an old lighter and three pipes, I was able to tell him it didn’t.

Sendak did have other friends besides objects as he grew up. He had a close relationship with his brother Jack. Both boys enjoyed drawing, and one of their amusements was making books. These combined cut-out newspaper photographs and comic strips with sketches of the Sendak family. The books were bound with tape, had elaborately illustrated covers, and contained a good deal of painstaking hand lettering.

“I was always conscious of usable material for books,” Sendak recalls. “I remember examining my grandmother all the time and placing her in various fantasies. And I was so conscious of the streets on which I lived that I can remember them now in complete detail—how many houses there were, who lived in which house, what the people looked like. During my early teens, I spent a lot of time at the window, sketching the kids at play, and those sketchbooks are, in a sense, the foundation of much of my later work. Maybe that’s another reason the children in my books are called European-looking. Many of them resemble the kids I knew growing up in Brooklyn. They were Jewish kids, and they may well look like little greenhorns just off the boat. They had—some of them, anyway—a kind of bowed look, as if the burdens of the world were on their shoulders.”

“The Sign on Rosie’s Door,” a Sendak book published in 1960, begins with the dedication:

Remembering Pearl Karchawer _ all the Rosies_ _ and Brooklyn._

Rosie is a girl with an unusually lively imagination, and she gets her friends—who do indeed look like Jewish children on the streets of Brooklyn—to take part in her fantasies. At one point, Rosie, sitting on a cellar door and covered from head to foot in a red blanket, identifies herself as “Alinda the lost girl.” “Who lost you?” asks a neighborhood literalist. “I lost myself,” Rosie answers. Like the fantasies in “Kenny’s Window” and a number of Sendak’s other stories, Rosie’s often involve highly active play. She announces that her “Magic Man” is coming, and all the children close their eyes, because he will not appear otherwise. They hear her speak to him, and when they are allowed to open their eyes again, Rosie tells them that the Magic Man has informed her that they can all be firecrackers. Rosie and her friends proceed to leap and dance through several pages.

When the teen-age Sendak wasn’t making books, he was reading other people’s. Though some were stories for children, his reading was indiscriminate. His sister subscribed to the Book-of-the-Month Club, and he read many of the volumes she received. “Now I can’t remember any children’s books or artists that profoundly influenced me in those years except Walt Disney,” he says. “I now say it to my shame, yet he did something tremendous for me. His pictures did move, and they often embodied lots of fantasy. With whatever money I had, I’d buy his coloring and cutout books, and I made animated sequences of my own based on his characters. And when I saw Disney’s ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’ at the Radio City Music Hall, I had an inkling of what it was I especially wanted to do. It was only later that I could see how Disney had despoiled beautiful stories and had abused the idea of animation. Kids don’t always know about the vulgar and tasteless, and to me Disney was a god. I remember a Mickey Mouse mask that came on a big box of cornflakes. What a fantastic mask! Such a big, bright, vivid, gorgeous hunk of face! My ambition was to work for Disney.”

Sendak graduated from Lafayette High School, in Brooklyn, in 1946. “I was an art major in high school, but we had no real instruction—I just sat and did what I wanted to,” he says. After school and weekends, he had worked for All American Comics, his job being to adapt “Mutt and Jeff” strips for comic books, fitting them into the page, filling in backgrounds, and extending the story line when necessary. He enjoyed this work, but school, by contrast, was a place of acute discomfort. “Nearly every morning, in order to get there, I had to talk myself out of a state of panic, he says. “I couldn’t stand being cloistered with other children, and I was usually so embarrassed that I stammered.”

After graduation, he went to work full time at Timely Service, a window-display house in lower Manhattan, beginning in a warehouse, where he helped construct store-window models of such figures as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs out of chicken wire, papier-mâché, spun glass, plaster, and paint. “It was one of the best times of my life,” Sendak says. “I was in Manhattan, and, for the first time, I knew people who were artists, who considered their work for Timely Service just a job to enable them to do real painting at night in their cold-water flats. There were all kinds of people I’d never met in Brooklyn.” When he had been at Timely Service for nearly two years, he was promoted to the department that conceived the window-display designs to be built in the warehouse. There he was unhappy. “The department consisted of another kind of artist—people in their fifties who had never got anywhere,” he recalls. Sendak left the display house in the summer of 1948, and during the next two months, at home in Brooklyn, he and his brother constructed six intricate animated wooden toys, performing scenes from “Little Red Riding Hood,” “Little Miss Muffet,” “Hansel and Gretel,” “Aladdin’s Lamp,” “Old Mother Hubbard,” and “Pinocchio.” The pieces, five of which Sendak now has in his studio, are in the tradition of eighteenth-century German lever-operated toys. When a lever on Little Red Riding Hood’s basket is pulled, for instance, a ferocious wolf leaps out of bed and Little Red Riding Hood collapses. The Sendak brothers took their toys to F. A. O. Schwarz. Their work was received with respect, but an official at the store pointed out that it would be too costly to reproduce the toys in large quantities. “Nor were we ready to compromise, if a compromise had been suggested,” Sendak says. “We wanted a workshop of little old men creating the little wooden parts, and we would not have permitted any kind of plastic substitute.” Ultimately, though, Richard Nell, Schwarz’s window-display director, was sufficiently impressed by the way in which Maurice Sendak had painted the toys to hire him as an assistant in the construction of window displays. (His brother, meanwhile, although he went on to work in the electronics field, has also written several children’s books, two of which Maurice has illustrated.)

Sendak worked at the toy store for three years, and attended evening classes at the Art Students League during most of that time. “It was the only kind of school I could endure, because it was freewheeling,” he says. “What you learned depended on what you wanted to learn.” Sendak took classes in life drawing, oil painting, and composition, and feels that he benefited particularly from the instruction in composition he was given by the illustrator John Groth. “He was important for me because he gave me a sense of the enormous potential for motion, for aliveness, in illustrations,” Sendak recalls. “And he himself was so deeply committed to the field that he showed how much fun creating in it could be.”

At F. A. O. Schwarz, Frances Chrystie, the store’s book buyer, who was a friend of Sendak’s, knew that he was eager to try illustrating children’s books, but when she suggested introducing him to Miss Nordstrom—partly because Harper’s was the publisher whose children’s books he most admired—he demurred, out of shyness. Miss Chrystie thereupon arranged for Miss Nordstrom to “happen by” one day, in the spring of 1950, when Sendak had tacked up a broad variety of his pictures on the walls of the store’s studio. The next day, Miss Nordstrom called Sendak and offered him the opportunity to illustrate Marcel Aymé’s “The Wonderful Farm.” He accepted, and the book was published in 1951. This was not the first time Sendak’s work had been published; in 1947 he had done diagrams and spot drawings for “Atomics for the Millions,” written by Hyman Ruchlis, one of his high-school teachers, and three years later he had illustrated a book about the Sabbath, “Good Shabos, Everybody,” for the United Synagogue Commission on Jewish Education, but “The Wonderful Farm” was the first real children’s book he had worked on. “It made me an official person,” Sendak now says.

In 1952, Sendak became widely known in the children’s-book field as the illustrator of Ruth Krauss’s “A Hole Is to Dig.” The book was quite unconventional for its time. It had no story. Instead, Miss Krauss, by talking with and listening to children, had assembled a series of children’s definitions, among them “A face is so you can make faces,” “Buttons are to keep people warm,” “A whistle is to make people jump,” and—a particular favorite with the book’s readers—“A tablespoon is to eat a table with.” The general idea of “A Hole Is to Dig” has since been repeated many times, often coyly. But Sendak’s small people, seen at play among themselves, sticking out their tongues, closing their eyes in anticipation of being kissed by their dogs’ tongues, wiggling their toes, and sliding delightedly in the mud, never seem saccharine.

An established illustrator had originally been considered for the assignment, but when he was shown simply a collection of definitions, he felt that there was no book in them at all. From the start, however, Sendak was enthusiastic about the book’s possibilities. “It was like being part of a revolution,” he says. “This was the first time in modern children’s-book history that a book had come directly from kids. The notion was so startling to some academics, in fact, that the book was included in a course at Columbia on the uses of language. And, you know, some of those definitions have become part of the language. Working on that book, I learned something else, too. When it seemed to me to be all done, Ruth Krauss pointed out that I was giving the kids who would read the book middle-class attitudes toward their roles. I had the boys doing what boys were expected to do and girls doing what they were expected to do. God forbid a boy should be jumping rope! Of course, that isn’t the way it is, and at the last minute I made some quick changes.”

“A Hole Is to Dig” prepared the way for such later works by others as “A Friend Is Someone Who Likes You,” “Love Is a Special Way of Feeling,” and “Happiness Is a Warm Puppy,” and it was influential in other ways, too. Its format was small, and its success brought back what Sendak identifies as “the little book,” adding, “And, God help us, it hasn’t stopped.” The book was printed on brown-tinted paper, and for the illustrations Sendak had deliberately used his most “old-fashioned” style, his pen-and-ink drawings including a considerable amount of crosshatching, in the tradition of nineteenth-century German and British illustrators.

The success of “A Hole Is to Dig” was such that Sendak was able to leave F. A. O. Schwarz, move to Manhattan, and become a freelance illustrator. Assignments poured in, from Miss Nordstrom and from editors at other publishing houses, and in the years that followed Sendak illustrated the work of various writers. There have been seven more books by Ruth Krauss, and seven books for older children by the Dutch-born writer Meindert Dejong, and Sendak has also had the privilege of collaborating posthumously with Tolstoy (“Nikolenka’s Childhood”), the German Clemens Brentano (“The Tale of Gockel, Hinkel & Gackeliah” and “Schoolmaster Whackwell’s Wonderful Sons”), the German Wilhelm Hauff (“Dwarf Long-Nose”), and the American Frank Stockton (“The Bee-Man of Orn” and “The Griffin and the Minor Canon”). In a preface to “The Griffin and the Minor Canon,” Sendak describes his basic aim as an illustrator: “I wanted at all costs to avoid the serious pitfall of illustrating with pictures what the author had already . . . illustrated with words. I hoped, rather, to let the story speak for itself, with my pictures as a kind of background music—music in the right style and always in tune with the words.”

Sendak elaborated on the degree to which he conceives his work musically in an article called “The Shape of Music,” which appeared in the Sunday Herald Tribune late in 1964. “The spontaneous breaking into song and dance seems so natural and instinctive a part of childhood,” he wrote. “It is perhaps the medium through which children best express the inexpressible; fantasy and feeling lie deeper than words—beyond the words yet available to a child—and both demand a more profound, more biological expression, the primitive expression of music.” Sendak is convinced that children will respond most spontaneously to illustrations that, in his words, “have a sense of music and dance and are not something just glued onto the page.”

In the work of the illustrators that Sendak most admires, he invariably finds a musical quality that he terms “authentic liveliness.” He points to the linear arabesques in the lamb’s dance of death in Boutet de Monvel’s drawings for La Fontaine’s “Fables Choisies pour les Enfants,” and to the same artist’s “harmonic inventions” achieved by the subtle use of color and line. In the work of Randolph Caldecott, Sendak is fascinated not only by the abundance of actual dancing, singing, and playing of instruments but also by the many ways in which Caldecott used the theme-and-variations technique, combining simple themes into what Sendak describes as “a fantastically various interplay of images.”

When Sendak is at work, he not only thinks in musical terms but often has music playing. He begins by trying to find the composer and the piece of music that fit the mood and tone of the story on his drawing board, and he may listen to many recordings before he hits on the right musical colors. “Books, too, can be evocative for me when I’m working on a series of illustrations,” he says. “I often turn to James, Stendhal, D. H. Lawrence, and Melville—especially James, with his acute sensitivity to what happens inside someone growing. But it is music that does most to open me up. That’s why I have all these records—and I go to quite a lot of concerts, too. The other night, for example, I was sitting here listening to ‘Die Meistersinger,’ which I know by heart, and got excited about it all over again. What struck me this time was that Wagner, in some mysterious way, had made the atmosphere—the very night air—of Nuremberg into music. I could see the city and smell it. And that’s the kind of thing I want to convey in my illustrations. The pictures should he so organically akin to the text, so reflective of its atmosphere, that they look as if they could have been done in no other way. They should help create the special world of the story. When this kind of drawing works, I feel like a magician, because I’m creating the air for a writer.”

In illustrating stories of his own, Sendak sometimes encounters an odd difficulty in performing this magic. “I find myself writing things that I don’t like to draw, as if I were two separate people,” he explains. “As a writer, I may, for instance, ask the illustrator part of me to draw too many specific details of a room or of clothes. As an illustrator, I most enjoy interpreting emotions. In ‘Where the Wild Things Are,’ those two selves fused, in that the illustrations were a complete imaginative backdrop to the feelings experienced in the course of fantasy. Being dreamlike and fluid, the scenes aren’t hung up with the kind of particulars that are involved in aiming at literal verisimilitude.”

“Where the Wild Things Are,” which was published in 1963, marked a key stage in Sendak’s development. In 1964, the book received the Caldecott Medal, awarded annually by the American Library Association for the most distinguished American picture book for children. Sendak went to St. Louis for the presentation, and in his acceptance speech he said, “With ‘Where the Wild Things Are,’ I feel I am at the end of a long apprenticeship. By that I mean all my previous work now seems to have been an elaborate preparation for it.” Miss Nordstrom says that “Where the Wild Things Are” is of singular historical importance because “it is the first American picture book for children to recognize that children have powerful emotions—anger and fear as well as the need Max had, after his anger was spent, to be ‘where someone loved him best of all.’ ” She adds, “A lot of good picture books have had fine stories and lovely pictures, and some have touched beautifully on basic elements in a child’s life—physical growth, coming to terms with a new sister or brother, and the like. But it seems to me that ‘Where the Wild Things Are’ goes deeper than previous picture books have gone.”

Miss Nordstrom was not surprised that the book met with some hostile reactions from critics and librarians. “The furor reminded me of the New York Public Library’s refusal to give shelf room to E. B. White’s ‘Stuart Little’ for some months back in 1945, when it came out,” she says. “The statement that Mrs. Little’s second son was born looking very much like a mouse made one librarian there unable to sleep for three nights. Or so she told me. But the children who read and loved that book weren’t thinking of any actual process of giving birth to a mouse—they thought it was nice to have a mouse in the family. There were even some negative reactions to ‘A Hole Is to Dig.’ One librarian was appalled at the definition ‘A face is to make faces with.’ She said she didn’t want her children making faces and when ‘Where the Wild Things Are’ came out, another librarian told me the book would frighten little children to death. ‘But Max conquers those monsters,’ I said. ‘He becomes king of the wild things.’ But she was obviously horrified, perhaps too horrified to imagine that children might react with pleasure to the book.” A reviewer for the Journal of Nursery Education mused, “We should not like to have it left about where a sensitive child might find it to pore over in the twilight.” Publishers’ Weekly , after saying that “the plan and technique of the illustrations are superb,” cautioned, “But they may well prove frightening, accompanied as they are by a pointless and confusing story.” Among the adults who were not traumatized by Max’s journey was a critic for the Library Journal , who wrote, “Each word has been carefully chosen to express Max’s mood precisely,” and “The wild things who acclaim him their king are at once both ugly and humorous.” The critic did, however, feel compelled to add, “This is the kind of story that many adults will question and for many reasons, but the child will accept it wisely and without inhibition, as he knows it is written for him.” A reviewer for the Cleveland Press was also both appreciative of the book and apprehensive about possible adult storms, noting, “Boys and girls may have to shield their parents from this book. Parents are very easily scared.”

Sendak had expected a certain amount of angry reaction to “Where the Wild Things Are.” In his speech accepting the Caldecott Medal, he referred with some acerbity to those noncontroversial children’s books that offer “a gilded world unshadowed by the least suggestion of conflict or pain, a world manufactured by those who cannot—or don’t care to—remember the truth of their own childhood.” Of these he said, “Their expurgated vision has no relation to the way real children live. I suppose these books have some purpose—they don’t frighten adults. . . . The popularity of such books is proof of endless pussyfooting about the grim aspects of child life, pussyfooting that attempts to justify itself by reminding us that we must not frighten our children. Of course, we must avoid frightening children, if by that we mean protecting them from experiences beyond their emotional capabilities; but I doubt that this is what most people mean when they say, ‘We must not frighten our children.’ The need for half-truth books is the most obvious indication of the common wish to protect children from their everyday fears and anxieties, a hopeless wish that denies the child’s endless battle with disturbing emotions.”"

“The Cong were after me,” Trump said, visibly stirred by the memory. “And then, just in the nick of time, I got my deferment.”

The former reality-show star said he had never shared his record as a war hero before because “I don’t like to boast.”

He said that he only disclosed the episode now because “the way this nation treats our deferment veterans is a disgrace.”

Trump complained that he received no official commendation or medal for his heroism, calling the lack of recognition “shameful.”

“Those brave Americans who, like me, avoided being captured by not serving at all—we are the true heroes,” he said.

Trump’s tale of valor appeared to move many members of his audience, some of whom waited in line after his speech to thank him for his lack of service.

417,http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/24/a-novel-brings-israels-conflicts-to-new-york,newyorker,A Novel Brings Israel’s Conflicts to New York,[],"As a form, the novel can never decide quite how stylish it should be. Is it a mirror or a music, a camera or a painting? Is it best designed for the long haul or for fine circular flights? Is it where we make a fetish of the perfect sentence, or a more relaxed religion of the appropriate form? Nabokov liked to dismiss writers who failed the Nabokovian sentence test, such as Camus, Mann, and Stendhal (who indeed likened the novel to a mirror). But the novelist ideally writes in paragraphs and chapters, not in sentences, as Woolf reminded her readers. Novelistic form, the accretion of many sentences, must find its own deeper, slower rhythm. In this regard, Iris Murdoch once divided the twentieth-century novel into the journalistic and the crystalline, and Woolf, the modernist aesthete who also loved Dickens and Scott and Tolstoy, couldn’t quite decide whether she liked her novels hospitably journalistic or stylishly crystalline. Like many of us, she wanted different pleasures from different novelists.

Joshua Cohen is an extraordinary prose stylist, surely one of the most prodigious at work in American fiction today. (And he is only thirty-six.) At his best, he resembles Saul Bellow: his sentences are all-season journeyers, able to do everything everywhere at once. He can be witty, slangy, lyrical, ironic, vivid; he possesses leaping powers of metaphor and analogy. Most writers develop certain talents at the expense of others, but Cohen relishes verbs as much as adjectives, metaphor-making as much as epigram-minting. Style is a patent priority: his fiction displays the stretch marks of its originality. In his new novel, “ Moving Kings ” (Random House), there are wonderfully strange verbs. In a cab: “The driver rancored away in Arabic, to himself or just a specter.” At a party: “A girl brisked over.” There are interesting new adjectives (or nouns turned into adjectives): “A hypermarket, a pharmacy, a dun huttish structure topped with a blinking red neon star.” And precise metaphorical descriptions, like this one of traffic in Queens: “He turned onto Northern Boulevard heading south. The cars seeped like spread tar and hardened into traffic.” Or the heat in Mexico: “The sun was sowing him a migraine.” But even when Cohen is not putting out his flags the prose is alert, tense with vitality. Here David King, newly arrived in Israel, prepares to meet his cousins: “The next morning, the second day—the day that God divided the sky from the waters below and so created the conditions for jetlag—David’s cousins were waiting in the lobby.”

Cohen is, in fact, a crystalline novelist with a journalistic openness to the world; his stylish sentences are loaded with the refuse of the real, with the facts, social data, and informational surplus of postmodernity. In this will to supreme combination, he resembles Thomas Pynchon (with Joyce the blessed progenitor), or David Foster Wallace. Cohen’s previous novel, the massive and massively ambitious “ Book of Numbers ” (2015), marched, in seven-league boots, over vast terrain: comparative theology, postmodern philosophy, questions of contemporary gender, the monstrous complacencies of the Internet age. As in Wallace’s work, there is a recognizable tension between the priority of style and the boisterous claims of the world, a tension as old as realism itself.

There are moments in Cohen’s work when his worldly omnivorousness (the desire to cover everything) and his stylistic talents (the desire to cover everything in the most brilliant style) seem to be running a race with each other. “Book of Numbers” was sometimes hard to read, not because it was incomprehensible or too demanding but because its textures were overwhelming, and because it struggled to find a form that could contain and focus those textures. Cohen’s natural inclination is toward a loquacious, storytelling largesse, but each of his sentences is also a micro-adventure in abundance. Here, in his new novel, he sketches some of the guys who work for David King’s company, King’s Moving. Each brief portrait is a stuffed pantechnicon:

Gyorgi had worked as a mover until he’d touched a female minor who’d clerked at a gypsum sheather in Paterson, served most of a lenient sentence, and was now confined behind a storage cage to be more findable by his parole officer. . . . Ronaldo Rodriguez, AKA Ronriguez, AKA Godriguez, AKA Burrito Ron, earned the last of his nicknames pioneering the technique of taking a customer’s odd loose possessions and rolling them up in a rug for efficiency of transport. He was a squat wide-assed low center of gravity surmounted by a slick pubic moustache. Malcom C, alias Talcum X, powdered his pits to stay dry and his hands to improve his grip. He was bullet bald and jacked, with two additional adductor muscles found in only .006% of the population.

“Moving Kings” also struggles with form, but this may represent a conscious effort on the author’s part at self-contraception. It is relatively brief (two hundred and forty pages), accessible, and more or less conventionally structured; it is highly intelligent but not a novel of ideas, and though its prose does plenty of swaggering, the swagger belongs to the characters—which is to say, most of the novel is written in close third-person or free indirect style, the grammar of everyday contemporary realism. It’s the right style for this novel’s world, which is burly with particularities and vibrant with voice. The atmosphere at times resembles a Jewish “Sopranos,” minus the violence—men, family, moneymaking, muscle. David King, the son of a Jewish immigrant and Holocaust survivor, reared in Queens, owns a successful moving company with storage facilities in all five boroughs. We first encounter him at a fancy fund-raiser in the Hamptons, where he stands out like a sweating cart horse among dry Arabians—bigger, coarser, burdened by work and apprehensions of work: “He moved among the servers who made $8.75 an hour and so who made about 14 cents, 14.5833 cents, he did the figures in his head, for each minute it took them to carve him primerib or fix him a scotch or direct him and his menthols to a smoking area.”

David King is recognizable enough, if not to the partygoers on Long Island: much less successful at life than at business; cocky, self-reliant, thinly cultured, wounded, comically poor in diet and karma. He has survived a heart attack, a pulverizing divorce from Bonnie, his Christian-convert wife—“Bonnie, the Fordham Road Albanian Orthodox who’d dipped in the mikveh and stepped out dripping for him”— and an affair with Ruth, his office manager. He has witnessed and waited out his daughter Tammy’s drug addiction and recovery, her graduation from N.Y.U. rewarded by the paternal gift of a brownstone in Crown Heights.

Until now, David’s Jewishness has been atavistically reflexive. He has visited Israel from time to time, but hasn’t given the country much concentrated thought, tending to liken its fate to his business prospects: if the core concern is strong, you don’t sweat the smaller stuff, which you can’t do much to influence anyway. That changes in the spring of 2015, after David’s heart attack. His cousin Dina e-mails to ask if he might host (and employ) her son, Yoav, who is finishing his national service in the Israeli Army. David responds from his convalescence in a way that seems forgivably sentimental, if also novelistically convenient. To have Israeli family in America, thinks David, is to have Israel in America: “If he’d stay in touch with Israel, if he’d maintain with Israel, certain responsibilities would devolve on the living after his demise. He was almost sure of it, he almost said it aloud: who among the living was going to shovel the dirt in his grave or say a kaddish? His daughter?”

A certain kind of Jewish novel would proceed to burn this familiar fuel: a father finds a substitute son, a religiously indolent American Jew renovates his ancient inheritance, the tough guy from Queens, getting older and sicker, softens up a bit. Cohen prepares the fire but proves nicely uninterested in the combustion. Wary of conventional payoffs, or even of conventional rises and falls, he likes to swerve away from a story or a character he has spent many pages establishing, in search of a fresh center of interest. The intermittency can be frustrating. As a novelist, he’s jittery, mobile, always on the prowl for new material, not so much easily distracted as easily consumed, quickly recentered. Once he has set up Yoav’s arrival and David’s soft patriarchal anticipation, he largely moves his focus away from David’s American scene and fills in, at some length, Yoav’s experiences as an Israeli soldier during the 2014 Gaza War."
419,http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-veteran-ice-agent-disillusioned-with-the-trump-era-speaks-out,newyorker,"A Veteran ICE Agent, Disillusioned with the Trump Era, Speaks Out",[],"In March, two months after President Trump took office, I received a text message from a veteran agent at Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ). I had been trying to find field agents willing to describe what life was like at the agency in the Trump era. This agent agreed to talk. Over the past four months, we have texted often and spoken on the phone several times. Some of our discussions have been about the specifics of new federal policies aimed at dramatically increasing the number of deportations. At other times, we’ve talked more broadly about how the culture at ICE has shifted. In April, the agent texted me a screen shot of a page from the minutes of a recent meeting, during which a superior had said that it was “the most exciting time to be part of ICE ” in the agency’s history. The photo was sent without commentary—the agent just wanted someone on the outside to see it.

The agent, who has worked in federal immigration enforcement since the Clinton Administration, has been unsettled by the new order at ICE . During the campaign, many rank-and-file agents publicly cheered Trump’s pledge to deport more immigrants, and, since Inauguration Day, the Administration has explicitly encouraged them to pursue the undocumented as aggressively as possible. “We’re going to get sued,” the agent told me at one point. “You have guys who are doing whatever they want in the field, going after whoever they want.” At first, the agent spoke to me on the condition that I not publish anything about our conversations. But that has changed. Increasingly angry about the direction in which ICE is moving, the agent agreed last week to let me publish some of the details of our talks, as long as I didn’t include identifying information.

“We used to look at things through the totality of the circumstances when it came to a removal order—that’s out the window,” the agent told me the other day. “I don’t know that there’s that appreciation of the entire realm of what we’re doing. It’s not just the person we’re removing. It’s their entire family. People say, ‘Well, they put themselves in this position because they came illegally.’ I totally understand that. But you have to remember that our job is not to judge. The problem is that now there are lots of people who feel free to feel contempt.”

Like many ICE employees, the agent was a critic of President Barack Obama, whose push to standardize enforcement practice and micromanage agents, particularly during his second term, was a source of frustration at the agency. Yet with Obama gone, and the era of micromanagement over, the agent sees long-standing standards being discarded and basic protocols questioned. “I have officers who are more likely now to push back,” the agent said. “I’d never have someone say, ‘Why do I have to call an interpreter? Why don’t they speak English?’ Now I get it frequently. I get this from people who are younger. That’s one group. And I also get it from people who are ethnocentric: ‘Our way is the right way—I shouldn’t have to speak in your language. This is America.’ ” It all adds up, the agent said, “to contempt that I’ve never seen so rampant towards the aliens.”

The agent’s decision to allow me to write about our conversations came after learning that ICE was making a push, beginning this week, to arrest young undocumented immigrants who were part of a large wave of unaccompanied minors who crossed the border in recent years and who, until now, had been allowed to live in the U.S. Rather than detaining these young people, the government had placed them in the care of families around the country. Most of them are trying to lead new lives as American transplants, going to school and working. ICE now plans to pursue those who have turned eighteen since crossing the border, and who, as a result, qualify for detention as legal adults. “I don’t see the point in it,” the agent said. “The plan is to take them back into custody, and then figure it out. I don’t understand it. We’re doing it because we can, and it bothers the hell out of me.”

The agent went on, “The whole idea is targeting kids. I know that technically they meet the legal definition of being adults. Fine. But if they were my kids travelling in a foreign country, I wouldn’t be O.K. with this. We’re not doing what we tell people we do. If you look next month, or at the end of this month, at the people in custody, it’s people who’ve been here for years. They’re supposed to be in high school.”

The agent was especially concerned about a new policy that allows ICE to investigate cases of immigrants who may have paid smugglers to bring their children or relatives into the country. ICE considers these family members guilty of placing children “directly in harm’s way,” as one spokeswoman recently put it, and the agency will hold them “accountable for their role in these conspiracies.” According to ICE , these measures will help combat “a constant humanitarian threat,” but the agent said that rationale was just a pretext to increase arrests and eventually deport more people. “We seem to be targeting the most vulnerable people, not the worst.” The agent also believes that the policy will make it harder for the government to handle unaccompanied children who show up at the border. “You’re going to have kids stuck in detention because parents are too scared of being prosecuted to want to pick them up!” the agent said.

U.S. immigration courts are facing a backlog of half a million cases, with only a limited number of judges available to hear them and issue rulings. “We still have to make decisions based on a responsible use of the government’s resources—you can’t lock everybody up,” the agent said. “We’re putting more people into that overburdened system just because we can. There’s just this school of thought that, well, we can do what we want.”

Before this year, the agent had never spoken to the media. “I have a couple of colleagues that I can kind of talk to, but not many,” the agent said. “This has been a difficult year for many of us.” These people, not just at ICE but also at other federal agencies tasked with enforcing the nation’s immigration laws, are “trying to figure out how to minimize the damage.” It isn’t clear what, exactly, they can do under the circumstances. “Immigration is a pendulum—it swings to the left sometimes, or it swings to the right,” the agent told me last week. “But there was a normal range. Now people are bringing their own opinions into work.” In the agent’s view, ICE is a changed agency.

“I like predictability,” the agent said. “I like being able to go into work and have faith in my senior managers and the Administration, and to know that, regardless of their political views, at the end of the day they’re going to do something that’s appropriate. I don’t feel that way anymore.”"

421,http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-senate-health-care-vote-o-rama-a-guide-for-the-perplexed,newyorker,The Senate Health-Care Vote-O-Rama: A Guide for the Perplexed,[],"Are you confused by what’s happening as the Senate debates various health-care-reform proposals? Join the club. “I read and analyze health legislation for a living. And I’m having trouble keeping up with the big and complicated changes in real time,” Larry Levitt, a senior vice-president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, tweeted on Tuesday night, as a series of votes began. On Wednesday, there were more votes, and there will be still more on Thursday—many, many of them, as the process climaxes in a so-called Vote-O-Rama.

Many of these votes don’t mean much: they concern Democratic amendments that have no chance of passing. But some of the votes are highly consequential, and two of them have already delivered significant setbacks to the Republican Party leadership. On Tuesday night, an amended version of the Better Care Reconciliation Act, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s proposal to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, was defeated , with fifty-seven senators voting against it, including nine Republicans. And, on Wednesday afternoon, a proposal to repeal Obamacare but put off a replacement for two years, which was McConnell’s Plan B, was also defeated , this time with fifty-five senators against it.

Much of the news coverage and commentary then began to focus on the last remaining big vote, on a so-called skinny-repeal bill, which could take place late Thursday. Skinny repeal could be considered McConnell’s Plan C. But before considering the details of this proposal it is worth dwelling for a moment on what has already happened. Earlier this week, McConnell got senators to agree to start a floor debate without knowing what sort of proposals would be considered. This cynical tactic gave new life to the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare. The subsequent votes then represented an important victory for everybody who has opposed the Republicans’ plans, and especially those who have sought to exert pressure on elected G.O.P. officials.

In failing to pass either a repeal-and-replace bill or a repeal-only bill, the G.O.P. has publicly demonstrated that it’s too fractured to turn history back to before March of 2010, when the A.C.A. became law. The effort to resurrect the Better Care Reconciliation Act ran into opposition from ultra-conservative senators, such as Mike Lee and Rand Paul, who didn’t think the bill went far enough, as well as moderate Republicans, such as Susan Collins, Dean Heller, and Lisa Murkowski, who were concerned about the slashing cuts to Medicaid that the measure contained. Then, in opposing the repeal-only bill, which would have created great uncertainty for tens of millions of Americans and chaos in the health-care industry, four more moderates joined Collins, Heller, and Murkowski: Lamar Alexander, Shelley Moore Capito, John McCain, and Rob Portman.

Taken together, these votes suggest that it is now highly likely that a good deal of Obamacare will remain in place—the unresolved question is just how much.

If you believe the news reports about what the skinny-repeal bill will look like when McConnell finally releases it, most of the A.C.A. appears likely to emerge unscathed, including the Medicaid expansion, which has enabled about fourteen million Americans to get health care; the Obamacare exchanges, where more than twelve million people signed up this year to purchase private insurance; the federal subsidies that greatly reduce the cost of these policies for low-to-middle-income households; the regulations that force insurers to offer comprehensive policies; the prohibition on insurers barring people with preëxisting conditions; and the taxes on the one per cent that help to finance the system. A number of reports say that the skinny-repeal bill would target only the individual and employer mandates, as well as the taxes on medical devices.

Of course, these reports could be wrong. And, in any case, it is unwise to take at face value anything that McConnell plans to do. Repealing the two mandates would have broad and damaging repercussions. According to a 2015 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, eliminating the individual mandate would increase the number of uninsured by about fifteen million over a decade and raise premiums for everybody else by about twenty per cent. Among health-care experts, there is debate about whether, as enrollment in insurance plans fell and prices rose, the Obamacare exchanges could then eventually enter a death spiral. On Wednesday, Levitt warned about this as a serious possibility. Loren Adler, an analyst at the Brookings Institution, said that although repealing the mandates would create some serious problems, it would not be sufficient to destroy the insurance exchanges, because the continued availability of the federal subsidies would prevent the number of enrollees from falling too far.

The other, even bigger, problem with the skinny-repeal bill is that it likely won’t be designed to be the final version of the Republican legislation. Practically everybody on Capitol Hill believes that McConnell is putting it forward as a ruse to toss the ball to a House-Senate conference, which could then come back with a much broader bill that would torpedo the insurance exchanges, roll back the Medicaid expansion, and get rid of the taxes on the rich.

“GOP leaders would craft that version behind closed doors during Congress’ August recess and in early September,” Bob Greenstein, the president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, warned in a blog post on Wednesday. “They would then present it to the House and Senate for final votes later in September, with limited debate and no amendments allowed—and with GOP leaders applying maximum pressure on Republican senators and House members to fall in line. In short, the ‘skinny repeal’ bill is a Trojan horse designed to resuscitate the effort to repeal large parts of the ACA and impose big Medicaid cuts that would jeopardize coverage for millions of the nation’s neediest people.”

Based on McConnell’s record, there is every reason to suppose that he would very much like this scenario to play out as Greenstein described it. After the votes on Tuesday and Wednesday, however, many people on Capitol Hill are doubtful that even the Senate Majority Leader, with all his Machiavellian ways, will be able to pull it off. “Almost every GOP aide I’ve talked to—both House and Senate—are skeptical that a conference committee will come up with something that can pass the Senate,” Axios’s Caitlin Owens reported on Wednesday evening. “If the Senate couldn’t accomplish this feat itself, the reasoning goes, why would a conference committee that must bridge the gap between Senate moderates and the House Freedom Caucus?”

If the skinny-repeal bill got through the Senate, but the effort to put together a more comprehensive piece of legislation then failed, the Republican leaders from both houses could conceivably settle for making the Senate bill law—and Donald Trump could conceivably declare victory on health care and move on. But I am getting ahead of the story. Right now, it isn’t entirely clear if McConnell will get anything passed at all, and the most effective way to insure that the G.O.P.’s effort to wreck Obamacare is permanently frustrated would be to prevent the skinny-repeal bill from getting fifty-one votes. If that is what you would like to see happen, and especially if you live in a red state, this is a good day to call your senator.

425,http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/discovering-the-brilliance-of-helio-oiticica,newyorker,Discovering the Brilliance of Hélio Oiticica,[],"I’m getting braver at saying the name of a sorely under-known Brazilian artist whose retrospective at the Whitney Museum, “Hélio Oiticica: To Organize Delirium,” comes as an overdue revelation. Oiticica died in 1980, of a stroke, at the age of forty-two, after early success in Rio de Janeiro, a brush with fame in London, obscurity during seven years in New York, and a return to Rio that, at one opening, occasioned a riot. Along the way, he turned from superb abstract painting to innovative work in sculpture, film, writing, political action, and participatory installation, much of which remains as fresh as this morning. The sand, huts, potted plants, caged parrots, and inscribed poetry of his sprawling “Tropicália” (1968) await your barefoot delectation, should you choose to park your shoes in the rack provided. So do the multifarious love nests (mattresses, straw, chopped-up foam rubber, water) of a more austere faux beach, “Eden” (1969). Works that he made in New York and, at the time, showed only privately exalt sex, drugs, and rock and roll—delirium aplenty, yet managed with acute aesthetic intelligence. But back to the name. My pronunciation can still come out a little different every time, along a scale from the “Oy-ti- seek -a” recommended in the Times to the “Whoa-ta- cee -kah” that a self-confident Midwestern friend of mine swears by. I mention this because a tin ear for Portuguese makes me typical in an art world that, with exceptions, has long been inattentive to Latin America.

Oiticica was born in Rio in 1937 to an upper-middle-class and deeply cultured family. His father was a polymath engineer, mathematician, scientist, and experimental photographer whose own father, a philologist, published an anarchist newspaper. Oiticica spent two years in Washington, D.C., starting in 1947, while his father worked at the National Museum of Natural History. He devoured modern philosophy, favoring Nietzsche. Back in Rio, he wrote plays, studied painting, and, in 1955, joined a group of artists who were strongly influenced by European geometric abstraction. (This put them on a course alien to artists in the United States, where Abstract Expressionism—soon to be followed by Pop art and minimalism—sought to eclipse European modernism. The split proved enduring.) In hundreds of small paintings—too few, in the show, to sate my appetite for them—the young Oiticica rang startling changes, mixing homage and rivalry, on the styles of Mondrian, Malevich, and Klee.

By 1960, with like-minded compatriots including Lygia Pape (her own grand retrospective currently at the Met Breuer signals a corrective attention to Latin- American art), Oiticica had developed sculptural expansions of painting, with standing and suspended panels. Those led to his “Penetrables”—booths that could be entered—and “Bólides,” finely built wooden boxes with drawers or flaps that viewers could open to find various raw materials, mostly earthen. He took to frequenting Rio’s favelas, the direly impoverished hillside shantytowns that overlook the prosperous city. The improvisatory folk culture there inspired his “Parangolés”: garments for festive wear, mainly capes, that he stitched together from swaths and scraps of colorful fabric. With concerted study, he became an expert samba dancer. When, in 1965, Rio’s Museum of Modern Art barred entry to Parangolé-clad folk brought by Oiticica to dance at the opening of a show that he was in, the group disported outside in what became a legendary ad-hoc pageant. A military coup in Brazil in 1964 had ushered in a period of governmental oppression, which initially spared artistic activities. Needling of the junta by Oiticica and other artists—“Be an outlaw, be a hero,” he printed in black on a red banner with the image of a fallen youth—ended, in 1968, with a crackdown that drove many, including him, into exile. Like other aspects of his quicksilver character, his politics were ambiguous: leftist in general but what might be termed pop-aristocratic in effect. Jimi Hendrix became a guiding light to Oiticica at least as consequential as Marcel Duchamp.

“Creleisure,” Oiticica termed the principle of his sensual installation “Eden” at London’s Whitechapel Gallery, in 1969. The idea of Dionysian pleasure-seeking as a creative and, somehow, politically meaningful pursuit was much in the air then. (An observer at the Whitechapel show, perhaps in the mood for an orgy, deplored the no-fun restraint of British viewers.) But Oiticica was too tough-minded to indulge in hippieish peace and love. “Sex and Violence, That’s What I Like,” he had lettered on one Parangolé. His gayness became a driving personal cause and may have figured in his move, in 1970, with funds from a Guggenheim grant, to post-Stonewall New York, where he took an apartment on Second Avenue in the East Village. He relished the round-the-clock bacchanal of the West Side piers, photographed hustlers, and filmed the drag star Mario Montez. But he disdained the commercially oriented scene at Andy Warhol’s Factory for, he said, “raising marginal activity to a bourgeois level.” Insuring his own marginality, he took to dealing cocaine, a drug that became something like the love of his life. He gave varieties of it poetic names: Snows of Kilimanjaro, for one, and Carol Channing’s Diamonds, for another. In an undated, lovely still-life photograph, a little heap of the intoxicant rests on a box of Bold laundry detergent.

I never met Oiticica, as far as I can recall, though he lived three short blocks from me and knew artists whom I knew—notably the dazzling Gordon Matta-Clark—in a scrappy SoHo milieu that was minuscule by today’s standards. I get to sample at the Whitney what (perhaps luckily for me in the long run) I missed out on in the hermetic scene that Oiticica hosted. “CC5 Hendrix-War” (1973) is a room equipped with six comfortable hammocks. Projected on the walls and ceilings are overlapping slides of the cover of “War Heroes,” a posthumous Hendrix album, from 1972, as its thrilling songs play from multiple speakers. On the cover, decorating Hendrix’s face like war paint, are lines of cocaine. Cradled in a hammock the other day, I couldn’t imagine anywhere in the world I would rather be, tracking subtle variations in the changing slides: for example, a matchbook first closed, then open, then burning, then, finally, burned. The work’s form anticipates subsequent generations of installation artists, none of whom can beat it for immersive and bracing cogency. Of course, Oiticica’s blitzed afflatus was insane, as any former addict will tell you. After 1975, references to cocaine dwindled in his work.

Oiticica was a great one for planning. His buoyant writings in English, displayed in vitrines and seductively recited through earphones, hatch intricate Utopian schemes, often architectural in character. In 1971, he proposed one that involved labyrinthine spaces, for construction in Central Park, called “Subterranean Tropicália Projects.” Judging by the maquette in the show, I endorse reviving the idea. Oiticica’s feel for spatial arrangement and proportion, developed in his early painting and sculpture, is just about preternatural. Had he lived longer, we would likely be blessed with a number of landmark achievements in public art.

In 1978, weary of New York and of being harassed, for want of a green card, by U.S. immigration authorities, Oiticica returned to Rio. His last major work, “PN27 Penetrable, ‘Rijanviera’ ” (the title was taken from a coinage referring to Rio de Janeiro in “Finnegans Wake”), ends the Whitney show in a spirit of chastening ritual. Entering a pavilion that is made of translucent, subtly hued plastic panels, you wade through running water and emerge on soft sand, amid a rock garden. The work’s solemnity didn’t deter rowdies in 1979 who attended the show in Copacabana where it was introduced, incautiously augmented with blasting Hendrix music. When the installation’s water pump broke, flooding the gallery, a number of the viewers went wild, wrecking a nearby piece by Lygia Pape and forcing Oiticica to physically defend his own (he is said to have hit one vandal in the face with a rock). But the contretemps seems not to have marred his happiness at being back in Brazil—“free free free,” he wrote to a friend. When he died, he had a profusion of projects in development, and a future ahead of him that invites our imagining. ♦"

A range of Trump’s traits were on display: lying (he wildly misrepresented the terms of the most recent Senate bill); an obsession with betrayal (he complained that senators who were his friends “might not be very much longer”); hinting at retribution (he said of Dean Heller, who had helped stall an earlier version of the bill, “He wants to remain a senator, doesn’t he?”); and inconsistency (he can’t seem to decide whether he wants to replace the bill or just repeal it). The one plausible notion Trump presented at the meeting was that, under President Obama, congressional Republicans had “an easy route: we’ll repeal, we’ll replace, and he’s never going to sign it.” Trump added, “But I’m signing it.” In other words, Trump had turned the Republicans into people with a real job—a hard job—and revealed their inability to perform it.

Yet, at the meeting, when Trump said that Obamacare is “gone, it’s failed—it’s not going to be around,” he was just repeating what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his colleagues have said any number of times. The bill got as far as it has in the Senate the same way that a similar one was passed in the House, with lies told in public and callousness dealt in private. Republican legislators peddled conspiracy theories about Obamacare being part of a scheme to strip Americans of their freedoms. The Senate version was drafted in secret and reflected an almost complete indifference to the needs of any Americans, really, apart from the wealthiest. McConnell, for his part, greeted Trump’s White House rant as a welcome act of statesmanship, portraying the President as a latter-day Lyndon Johnson “totally engaged,” behind the scenes, in the effort to round up votes.

In acting as though the bill still has a chance, McConnell may be undertaking another Trump-like maneuver: reducing matters of state to the level of farce. The Republicans have fifty-two Senate seats—fifty-one, for the moment, given the absence of John McCain, who last week received a diagnosis of brain cancer. This means that, with Vice-President Mike Pence as a tiebreaker, McConnell can lose only one vote. Every configuration of the bill so far has been unacceptable to more than one senator, for reasons both good and bad.

As the senators skittered between plans that would result in the loss of insurance coverage for as many as twenty-two or maybe thirty-two million Americans, some of them, including Heller and Susan Collins, expressed genuine concern about the devastating effect the bill would have on their constituents. Others, notably Jerry Moran, Rand Paul, and Mike Lee, insisted that the bill didn’t do enough to scrub Obamacare, and much of the Medicaid system, from the landscape. The damage that a repeal-without-replace plan would inflict was too much for Collins, Shelley Moore Capito, and Lisa Murkowski, who said that they would vote against bringing any such bill to the floor. For that, they were called traitors to their party, and threatened with primary challengers. Meanwhile, Ted Cruz slipped in an amendment that made the bill even worse, by opening a door to “junk” insurance plans and exorbitant premiums for people with preëxisting conditions.

All of this might suggest either that the G.O.P. was a party stumbling away in shame from a self-inflicted defeat or one that was narrowly saved by the obstinacy of a few of its members, who prevented it from doing something truly harmful to the lives of Americans. But to say that the divisions in the Republican caucus represent a coherent ideological debate between well-defined factions—business, populist, Freedom Caucus, libertarian—would be to assign to the process a dignity it doesn’t merit. The Republican leadership’s argument of last resort, when whipping votes, has been that the Party has to do something dramatic about Obamacare simply because, for the past seven years, it has said that it would. That is an explanation of a quagmire, not a call to arms. Capito, in defending her dissent, said, “ I did not come to Washington to hurt people ,” but it is far from clear what the Republicans did come to Congress to do. No one seems to have had an Obamacare-replacement plan at hand that makes even mathematical sense.

Still, McConnell has said that he will delay the Senate’s August recess, if necessary, to try for another vote on something: repeal, replace, or a thrown-together bill to be named later; his zigzagging mirrors that of the President. If this attempt fails, the backup plan seems to be to turn the matter over to the executive branch and let it commit whatever acts of regulatory, budgetary, and administrative vandalism it can, to break the system bit by bit. For example, it could withhold crucial cost-sharing subsidies, or decline to defend Obamacare against various lawsuits that its opponents, including the House Republicans, have brought against it. Uncertainty on such points is a major reason that some of the Obamacare exchanges are in a state of disarray. As with the primaries last year, the Party, with no center or true direction, may end up just leaving it to Trump.

The final drive to pass the bill will be another measure of how Trumpist the G.O.P. has become—and more tests of its character are on the way. This week, Donald Trump, Jr., will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about his meeting with various Russians; Jared Kushner, the President’s son-in-law, will appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee, though in closed session. The Republicans will have to decide how they will conduct those hearings and whether they are willing to insure that the investigation into Russia’s involvement in the Presidential election remains intact.

That question, too, just became more difficult. On the same day that Trump chastised the senators, he also humiliated one of their former colleagues, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, by saying, in an interview with the Times , that he would never have chosen Sessions if he’d known that he would recuse himself from the proceedings. Trump also seemed to confirm reports that his lawyers are investigating Robert Mueller, the special counsel on the case, in a search for excuses to get rid of him.

At this point, it will look like negligence if the Republicans don’t have a plan for what they will do if the President pushes Sessions out or orders the firing of Mueller. According to the Washington Post , Trump has asked his lawyers about the extent of his power to pardon his associates and family members, which would also serve to scuttle the investigation. He reportedly even asked about pardoning himself. The Senate Republicans may be wishing they had that option, too. ♦"

Stephen Greenblatt’s essay on his Jewish family, his experiences with anti-Semitism at Yale, and Shakespeare’s character Shylock, in “The Merchant of Venice,” overlooks the way that Shylock’s language limits his participation in Venetian society (“ If You Prick Us ,” July 10th & 17th). Shylock, unlike nearly every other character in the play, is unable to employ figurative language, and the metaphors he attempts are few and simple. His speech is literal, low, and often unattractive, and although these qualities make him more fully present to modern audiences, they render him more alien to the society that surrounded him. Even Shylock’s “Hath not a Jew eyes” speech—powerful, compelling, and full of humanity and raw emotion—is still completely literal, devoid of figurative language. Shakespeare supplies us with no scene in which Shylock speaks in normal and sympathetic tones, prays in a synagogue, invites a friend to supper, or cracks a joke that is not designed to hurt someone. All society, not just Christian society, is painful to him. No wonder Shylock does not appear in Act V. As Greenblatt says, in its formal design the play steadfastly remains a comedy.

Janet McGrath

College Park, Md.

When my father, Gerald Berlin, the son of Jewish immigrants, applied to Yale Law School, he presented a letter of recommendation from one of his professors at the University of Virginia. It read, “Gerald is a Jew, but he is not one of these New York Jews. He is from Virginia. And that makes all the difference.” At U.Va., my father was recruited by some of the “gentlemen” he met playing touch football to join Kirby Court, a club that had not previously admitted Jewish members. Apparently, they were fooled by his Southern accent and charm, and didn’t realize that he was Jewish. My father went on to an illustrious career, which included an appointment as the Massachusetts assistant attorney general for civil rights. But he always maintained a healthy skepticism of institutions that thrived on the insularity that Greenblatt describes.

Joshua D. Berlin

Arlington, Mass.

Greenblatt says that “what Shakespeare bequeathed to us offers the possibility of an escape from the mental ghettos most of us inhabit.” One mental ghetto is the belief that great literature is morally good for us, a premise that Greenblatt seems to accept. In “The Merchant of Venice,” the attitude toward Shylock is similar to that of people who find Israel’s claims to victimhood hypocritical in the light of its ongoing treatment of Palestinians. Perhaps it was ludicrous to an Elizabethan audience that a man who was willing to kill another man by holding him to a financial contract portrayed himself as a victim. It seems more plausible that Shakespeare shared the centuries-long prejudice against Jews than that he got carried away by his humanity and thus rendered his work, in Greenblatt’s words, an “uncomfortable” mix of high-mindedness and anti-Semitic attitudes.

Ed Hundert and Roger Seamon

Vancouver, B.C.

Greenblatt, in describing the universality of “our species’ cultural birthright,” and the “mixed blessings” of its contradictions, uses a derogatory term for the Saami, the indigenous people of Scandinavia: Laplander. We are not Laplanders, and we consider the word a racial slur. In our native land, we have been treated the way North America’s indigenous people have been treated—Saami were once even displayed in a human zoo in Germany. The irony of making a point about commonality while denigrating a particular group is disappointing.

432,http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/07/11/the-candy-man,newyorker,Roald Dahl’s Subversive Storytelling,[],"Roald Dahl, the British author of children’s books, wrote in a tiny cottage at the end of a trellised pathway canopied with twisting linden trees. He called it the “writing hut,” and, since Dahl was nearly six feet six, he must have inhabited it like a giant in an elf’s house. Dahl died in 1990, at the age of seventy-four, but one day a year his widow, Felicity, invites children to the estate where he lived, in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, and local families swarm in like guests at Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory. There are games—Splat the Rat and Guess the Number of Sweeties in the Jar—and tea, cakes, and orange squash for sale. An R.A.F. band plays in the shade of the house. This year, I attended myself. The appointed day was hot and bright, with a clear sky that Dahl would have described as “milky blue.” The girls wore sherbet-colored canvas hats; the boys, their pale legs poking out of shorts, looked destined for sunburns. Many of the kids peered inside the writing hut—they weren’t allowed in—and seemed to discover there further evidence that Dahl was a strangely sympathetic adult who shared a preoccupation with candy, a clinical fascination with the body, and a love of ingenious, self-devised schemes. The adults who looked into the hut were less impressed. The walls, lined with Styrofoam, were stained sepia from all the cigarettes Dahl smoked; there was a grotty wing chair; and wires for a jury-rigged heating system dangled from the ceiling. “You’d expect it to be grander,” one woman said. But the kids saw more possibilities in a musty old hut of one’s own. They liked the fact that Dahl, unsatisfied with desks, had designed a baize-covered writing board, to balance on his lap just so. And they loved that he kept, on a side table, a jar containing gristly bits of his own spine, which had been removed during an operation on his lower back. Next to the jar was a waxy-looking knob that turned out to be Dahl’s hip bone, along with a titanium replacement. “It makes a good letter opener,” one little boy said of the prosthetic hip. “Has it got blood on it?” another asked hopefully. Several young visitors asked for permission to hold the ball of chocolate-bar wrappers that Dahl had made as a young man; he scrunched a new one into the ball each day, after eating his habitual lunchtime treat. (Now hard and surprisingly heavy, the wad resembles a small cannonball.) Still, what seemed to excite the children the most was the paperback collection of Dahl’s own work. “Look!” several of them cried. “There are the books! ”

Dahl, whose first book for children, “The Gremlins,” was published in 1943, and whose last, “The Minpins,” was published posthumously, in 1991, has been astonishingly popular for nearly half a century. In a 2000 survey, British readers named him their favorite author. Around the world, more than ten million copies of his books sold last year. This number is all the more striking because Dahl did not write an extended series, which is often the key to mega-success as a children’s writer. Nor, in an era when many children’s books are specifically marketed to either boys or girls, does his work appeal primarily to one gender. Six of his books have been made into movies, and a monster-budget version of “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” (1964), directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp as the daft, dangerous, and endlessly inventive confectioner, Willy Wonka, opens in July. Dahl is also, however, a children’s writer whom many adults over the years have disliked or distrusted, though they have not always found it easy to say why. It’s not because his work is sexually explicit (a common complaint about, say, Judy Blume’s). There is no hint of sex, or even romance, in Dahl’s children’s books, most of which are intended for preadolescent children. Nor are they disappointing as pieces of writing—quite the opposite. Dahl’s books, which move along at a seductively brisk pace, are propelled by crisp verbs (“clambered,” “chirruped,” “rasped”) and delightful made-up words (“swishfiggler,” “snozzcumber,” “Vermicious Knids”). He plays exuberantly with synonyms (“He’s dotty!” they cried. “He’s barmy!” “He’s batty!” “He’s nutty!” “He’s screwy!” “He’s wacky!”). The tone is conversational, confiding, and funny, with a liberal sprinkling of exclamation points and phrases written entirely in capital letters. It’s as if the sentences came embedded with their own stage directions. (Like “Winnie the Pooh” and “Alice in Wonderland,” Dahl’s books originated as stories told aloud to children; he had five of his own.) In a Dahl book, you are never out of earshot of a sly authorial voice that is sharing a secret joke about a character—or is announcing that it’s about to yank you out of a scene that’s becoming a bit too gross or distressing. Adults’ objections to Dahl have more to do with his sensibility. There is bathroom humor: the protagonist of “The B.F.G.” (1982), the Big Friendly Giant, insists on “whizpopping,” his word for farting, in front of the Queen. And Dahl has a waspish tone—unsentimental, ever so slightly sadistic, and archly amusing—that’s closer to Evelyn Waugh’s than to Beverly Cleary’s. (Lemony Snicket, the author of “A Series of Unfortunate Events,” owes a significant debt to Dahl.) “Matilda” (1988) is the story of a prodigiously bright little girl who suffers at the hands of her boorish mother and father. The book offers a bracingly disdainful commentary on neglectful, selfish parents. But, first, Dahl has a little fun at the expense of the doting ones: It’s a funny thing about mothers and fathers. Even when their own child is the most disgusting little blister you could ever imagine, they still think he or she is wonderful. Some parents go further. They become so blinded by adoration they manage to convince themselves their child has qualities of genius. Well, there’s nothing very wrong with all this. It’s the way of the world. It’s only when the parents begin telling us about the brilliance of their own revolting offspring, that we start shouting, “Bring us a basin! We’re going to be sick!” School teachers suffer a good deal from having to listen to this sort of twaddle from proud parents, but they usually get their own back when the time comes to write their end-of-term reports. If I were a teacher, I would cook up some real scorchers for the children of doting parents. “Your son Maximilian,” I would write, “is a total wash-out. I hope you have a family business you can push him into when he leaves school because he sure as heck won’t get a job anywhere else.” Or, if I were feeling lyrical that day, I might write, “It is a curious truth that grasshoppers have their hearing organs in the sides of their abdomen. Your daughter Vanessa, judging by what she’s learnt this term, has no hearing organs at all.” Routinely in Dahl’s books, adults who mistreat children or animals get grotesque comeuppances, and these are often engineered by the victims, through their own cunning and courage. In “The Twits” (1980), the repellent Mr. and Mrs. Twit are glued upside down to the floor by the enterprising monkeys and birds they’ve been tormenting. In “James and the Giant Peach” (1961), the evil Aunt Spiker and Aunt Sponge are crushed to death when James and the eponymous peach roll down a hill. And it’s not just bad parents who get their comeuppance. In “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” Dahl metes out nasty punishments to unpleasant children. The greedy Augustus Gloop is squeezed into the chocolate works; the gum-chewing Violet Beauregarde blows up into a giant blueberry; the television addict Mike Teavee is miniaturized; the spoiled Veruca Salt is dropped down a garbage chute. That the kids all make it out of the factory in the end doesn’t much soften the fact that Wonka saw them go with no regret—indeed, with considerable glee. In many children’s books—contrary to what parents tell their children about the meaning of appearances—physical ugliness signifies its moral equivalent. Dahl takes this to an extreme, describing his villains’ repulsive attributes with brio: Mr. Hazell’s “great, glistening, beery face . . . as pink as a ham,” in “Danny, the Champion of the World” (1975); Aunt Sponge’s resemblance to “a great white soggy overboiled cabbage”; the “grizzly old grunion of a grandma” in “George’s Marvelous Medicine” (1981)—the one Dahl book I find irredeemably sour—who has “a small puckered-up mouth, like a dog’s bottom.” Dahl shared with George Orwell an acute sense of why small children often see adults as unsightly or intimidating. “Part of the reason for the ugliness of adults, in a child’s eyes, is that the child is usually looking upward, and few faces are at their best when seen from below,” Orwell wrote. Dahl once said that adults should get down on their knees for a week, in order to remember what it’s like to live in a world in which the people with all the power literally loom over you. In Dahl’s fiction, the bad characters aren’t just bad; they’re swing-kids-around-by-their-braids awful—a quality that some adult readers find unsubtle but many children find hilarious and satisfying. Even the good adult characters are often rash or easily cowed, whereas the kids in Dahl’s books are usually sensible, mature, and unflappable. (The kids make all the “good decisions,” as my nine-year-old son puts it.) And in Dahl’s stories the kinds of elaborate schemes that children are forever concocting—and that sensible adults are forever rejecting as impractical or dangerous—yield triumphant results. When the Giant Peach is attacked by sharks while floating across the ocean, James comes up with the idea of attaching loops of string to a flock of seagulls, in order to lift the peach into the air—and, voilà, that’s precisely what happens! Dahl’s books regularly show up on the American Library Association’s list of titles that patrons ask to be restricted from young children or removed from the shelves. In 1995, a mother attempting to expunge Dahl from elementary-school libraries in Virginia told the Washington Post that in his books “children misbehave and take retribution on adults, and there’s never, ever a consequence for their actions.” According to this surprisingly common critique of Dahl, to defy one adult—no matter how bad a person—is to defy us all. In 1972, the Horn Book , a journal of children’s literature, published a screed against Dahl by Eleanor Cameron, a children’s-book author. “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” she charged, was “one of the most tasteless books ever written for children.” The book was not just about candy; it was candy, “in that it is delectable and soothing while we are undergoing the brief sensory pleasure it affords but leaves us poorly nourished with our taste dulled for better fare.” Dahl reviled television, but his book provided the same easy satisfactions: it was a fast-paced, plot-driven celebration of empty calories. The science-fiction author Ursula K. LeGuin wrote in to second Cameron’s criticism, though she had to admit that “children between eight and eleven seem to be truly fascinated” by Dahl’s books. Indeed, one of her own children, she regretted to say, “used to finish ‘Charlie’ and then start right over from the beginning (she was subject to these fits for about two months at age eleven). She was like one possessed while reading it, and for a while after reading she was, for a usually amiable child, quite nasty.” The books, LeGuin concluded, “provide a genuine escape experience, a tiny psychological fugue, very like that provided by comic books.” In the nineteen-eighties, feminists lambasted Dahl for his supposed misogyny, focussing on “The Witches” (1983). In 1985, one critic called the book “a dangerous publication,” which bore a “striking similarity” to the “misogynistic” fifteenth-century witch-hunting text “Malleus Maleficarum.” It was a bizarre comparison. Dahl does write in “The Witches” that a “witch is always a woman”—but not that a woman is always a witch. The strongest, most appealing character in the book is the boy narrator’s cigar-smoking, tough-minded, and immensely loving grandmother. Anti-Dahlism has been further fuelled by a 1994 unauthorized biography, by the British writer Jeremy Treglown, which presents a complicated, domineering, and sometimes disagreeable man. Dahl was “a war hero, a connoisseur, a philanthropist and a devoted family man who had to confront an appalling succession of tragedies,” Treglown writes. “He was also . . . a fantasist, an anti-Semite, a bully and a self-publicizing trouble-maker.” When his first wife, the actress Patricia Neal, suffered a severe stroke at the age of thirty-nine, he adopted a cruel-to-be-kind strategy—bullying, goading, and sometimes humiliating her into acting again. He was prone to eruptions of pique. In 1981, Robert Gottlieb, who was at the time the editorial director of Knopf, Dahl’s American publisher, severed ties with Dahl, citing his “abusiveness” to the staff. More than once, Dahl offered up anti-Semitic remarks; in 1983, he told a journalist that “there’s a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity . . . I mean there is always a reason why anti-anything crops up anywhere; even a stinker like Hitler didn’t just pick on them for no reason.” (Such noxious sentiments, it must be said, cannot be found in his work for children.) And, in 1989, Dahl, who had no trouble waxing indignant about attempts to ban his own work, denounced Salman Rushdie as “a dangerous opportunist” after the fatwa was issued against him. Dahl’s personal reputation is justifiably tainted, but his work has been unfairly assailed. When it comes to literature for adults, we’ve mostly stopped judging a work by its author’s personal morality. Why should we hold children’s writers to a stricter standard?

Dahl’s own childhood had a lovely, rather magical side, as well as a bitter, Draconian one. He was born in 1916, in Llandaff, Wales, to Norwegian immigrants. His father, Harald, was a successful ship’s broker. His formidable and capable mother, Sofie, looked upon him as her favorite; Roald, one of five children, was known as “the apple.” When Roald was three, the eldest girl, Astri, who was seven, died of appendicitis. Harald Dahl was so “overwhelmed with grief,” Dahl writes in his 1984 memoir, “Boy,” that he had no strength to fight a bout of pneumonia; he died two months later. Each summer, Sofie took the children to a remote island in Norway, where Roald heard marvellous stories about witches and trolls, swam in the ice-blue fjords, and ate ice cream with “thousands of little chips of crisp burnt toffee mixed into it.” Yet the British boarding schools that he attended, starting at the age of nine, were mostly a misery. Much of “Boy” consists of Dahl’s recollections of beatings by his headmasters. Caning was the favored mode of punishment. “I was frightened of that cane,” Dahl writes. “There is no small boy in the world who wouldn’t be. It wasn’t simply an instrument for beating you. It was a weapon for wounding. It lacerated the skin. It caused severe black and scarlet bruising that took three weeks to disappear, and all the time during those three weeks, you could feel your heart beating along the wounds.” When Dahl was at school, his talents seem to have gone unappreciated. A report card from Repton in 1930—which is on display at the new Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre, in Great Missenden—offers the following assessment of his performance in English: “A persistent muddler, writing and saying the opposite of what he means. Fails to correct this by real revision or thought. Has possibilities.” This seems particularly unfair, given that the young Dahl, judging by a sample of his juvenilia at the museum—“The Life Story of a Penny”—already showed flair as a storyteller. But perhaps his teachers didn’t much approve of his nascent sympathy for the underdog—in this case, a lump of copper that must endure having “a picture of King George V’s head stamped cruelly on one side of me.” One compensation for Dahl was that he excelled at games and sports. Being tall probably protected him from a certain amount of torment, too—as a teen-ager, he was well on his way to acquiring his adult nicknames, Lofty and Stalky. He and the other boys at Repton also enjoyed a curious perk, courtesy of the Cadbury chocolate company. “Every now and again, a plain grey cardboard box was dished out to each boy in our House,” Dahl writes in “Boy.” Inside were eleven chocolate bars—aspirants to the Cadbury line. Dahl and the other boys got to rate the candy, and they took their task very seriously. (“Too subtle for the common palate” was one of Dahl’s assessments.) He later recalled this as the first time that he thought of chocolate bars as something concocted—the product of a laboratory setting—and the thought stayed with him until he invented his own crazy factory. Dahl is brilliant at evoking the childhood obsession with candy, which most adults can recall only vaguely. In his books, candy is often a springboard for long riffs on imagined powers and possibilities. Far from being the crude ode to instant gratification that critics like Cameron detect, Dahl’s evocation of candy is an impetus to wonder. When Billy, the boy in “The Giraffe, the Pelly, and Me” (1985), opens his own candy shop—talk about wish fulfillment!—he orders confections from all over the world. “I can remember especially the Giant Wangdoodles from Australia, every one with a huge ripe red strawberry hidden inside its crispy chocolate crust,” he says. “And The Electric Fizzcocklers that made every hair on your head stand straight up on end. . . . There was a whole lot of splendid stuff from the great Wonka factory itself, for example the famous Willy Wonka Rainbow Drops—suck them and you can spit in seven different colours. And his stickjaw for talkative parents.” The word “confection” has a double meaning in Dahl’s world—candy is a source not only of sweetness but of creativity. On a field trip recently, I sat next to three nine-year-old boys who spent forty-five minutes in a Wonka-inspired reverie, inventing their own candies. When Dahl left Repton, in 1934, he did not go to college but instead took a job with Shell, which eventually sent him to East Africa to sell oil. When the Second World War broke out, Dahl joined the R.A.F. as a fighter pilot. “Going Solo,” the sequel to “Boy,” offers lively accounts of Dahl’s encounters with African wildlife—especially the dread black mamba snake—and eccentric British expatriates, “this pack of sinewy sunburnt gophers and their bright bony little wives.” And it contains thrilling stories of Dahl’s experiences flying missions over the Mediterranean. In 1940, he crashed in the Sahara, and suffered injuries that caved in his nose. The plastic surgeon who rebuilt the nose tried, unsuccessfully, to make it look like Rudolph Valentino’s. When Dahl began to suffer blackouts as a result of his crash injuries, he stopped flying, and in 1942 went to Washington, D.C., as a military attaché. He met Martha Gellhorn and Ernest Hemingway and played poker with Senator Harry Truman. He began to write up some of his wartime experiences. He also met Walt Disney, to whom he sold “The Gremlins,” his first children’s story. It was based on an R.A.F. legend of gnomelike creatures with the capacity to sabotage a flight. (No movie version was ever produced.) Most of Dahl’s early writing was for adults. He specialized in wartime stories and macabre tales with surprise endings, or what the British call “a twist in the tail.” In a typical story, a wife kills her husband with a frozen leg of lamb, then cooks the murder weapon and serves it to police investigators. But by the early sixties some of that success had begun petering out. The New Yorker , which had earlier accepted several stories, now sent rejection notices. Dahl’s adult stories were crisply, shiveringly enjoyable—rather like “Twilight Zone” episodes—but they showed little compassion or psychological penetration. It was children, it seemed, not adults, on whom Dahl could lavish empathy. In 1953, he married Patricia Neal, who had recently ended a long affair with Gary Cooper, and the following year bought a house in Buckinghamshire, near his mother and sisters. Dahl adored his children, but in his family life he suffered several tragedies. His baby son, Theo, was badly injured when a car hit the carriage his nanny was pushing across a street in Manhattan. He survived but suffered from hydrocephalus. A daughter, Olivia, died from measles at the age of seven. Treglown writes that, shortly after Olivia’s death, Dahl and Neal visited his old headmaster, the retired Archbishop of Canterbury. Dahl wanted to think that Olivia could have the companionship of dogs in the afterlife, because she had loved them so in life. He was furious when the Archbishop told him that the Christian vision of Heaven did not include canines. In 1965, Neal suffered a stroke while she was pregnant with the couple’s fifth daughter, Lucy. While she recovered, Dahl took over running the household; he even drove the kids to school in the morning. If he was sometimes moody or gruff or turned on people who disappointed him, who can blame him? He was pragmatic and resourceful. Prompted by Theo’s difficulties, he helped devise a valve for draining water on the brain which was used to treat thousands of children. And if he was not physically affectionate with his children—as Tessa Dahl, his eldest daughter, has written—he shared their interest in pranks, knock-knock jokes, and incessant teasing. He also had a gift for creating an aura of magic. Dahl once directed Tessa to look at the grass below her bedroom window. Fairies, he explained, had inscribed her name on the lawn. (He’d done it himself, by sprinkling weed killer.) When the Dahls hosted slumber parties, he’d rouse the children at midnight, take them outside, and tell them stories under a tree. After thirty years of marriage, Dahl divorced Neal, and, in 1983, he married Felicity Crosland, a wood-carver with whom he had been having a long affair. He seems to have found greater happiness and serenity with Felicity, who was fond of gardening and cooking. Tessa Dahl has observed of her father, “When in 1983 he wrote, in ‘The Witches,’ ‘It doesn’t matter who you are or what you look like as long as somebody loves you,’ he was a changing writer. My father had fallen in love. When he married my stepmother in the early eighties, everything altered.” Several of Dahl’s best books—“The B.F.G.,” “The Witches,” “Matilda”—were written during this late period. In these works, his natural acidity is tempered with sweetness. Each book centers on a relationship between a child and an adult which is a dream of perfect understanding and companionability. The boy protagonist of “The Witches” adores his Grandmamma, who tells him the gruesome truth about witches and helps him defeat them. When the boy is transformed into a mouse—one that still has his own voice and feelings—he is comforted to realize that, with a mouse’s shorter life span, he won’t outlive her. He tells her happily, “I’ll be a very old mouse and you’ll be a very old grandmother and soon after that we’ll both die together.” (None of Dahl’s ideal adult companions are mothers—they are fathers, grandparents, or mother surrogates, such as the ladybug in “James and the Giant Peach.”) In “The B.F.G.,” an orphaned and unloved girl, Sophie, forms a strong friendship with the only living giant who refuses to eat human beings: “Words,” he said, “is oh such a twitch-tickling problem to me all my life. So you must simply try to be patient and stop squibbling. As I am telling you before, I know exactly what words I am wanting to say, but somehow or other they is always getting squiffs-quiddled around.” “That happens to everyone,” Sophie said. “Not like it happens to me,” the B.F.G. said. “I is speaking the most terrible wigglish.” “I think you speak beautifully,” Sophie said. “You do?” cried the B.F.G., suddenly brightening. “You really do?” “Simply beautifully,” Sophie repeated. “Well that is the nicest present anyone is ever giving me in my whole life!” cried the B.F.G. “Are you sure you is not twiddling my leg?” “Of course not,” Sophie said. “I just love the way you talk. “How wondercrump!” cried the B.F.G., still beaming. “How whoopsy-splunkers. How absolutely squiffling! I is all of a stutter.” And yet the essence of Dahl is his willingness to let children triumph over adults. He is a modern writer of fairy tales, who intuitively understands the sort of argument that Bruno Bettelheim made in his 1976 book, “The Uses of Enchantment.” Children need the dark materials of fairy tales because they need to make sense—in a symbolic, displaced way—of their own feelings of anger, resentment, and powerlessness. Children also benefit from learning about violence and brutishness in fairy tales, Bettelheim writes, for it counters the “widespread refusal to let children know that the source of much that goes wrong in our life is due to our natures—the propensity of all men for acting aggressively, asocially, selfishly.” Many fairy tales—and most of Dahl’s work—are complex narratives of wish fulfillment. They teach the reader, Bettelheim writes, that “a struggle against severe difficulties in life is unavoidable, is an intrinsic part of human existence—but if one does not shy away, but steadfastly meets unexpected and often unjust hardships, one masters all obstacles and at the end emerges victorious.” Or, in any case, this is a hopeful fantasy which sustains us all."

Speaking to reporters from his office at the Justice Department, Sessions said that, whatever Mrs. Trump had done to eliminate the scourge of cyberbullying, “It clearly has not been enough.”

“From my perspective, cyberbullying is very much a growing problem,” he said. “And with every passing day it gets worse and worse.”

Sessions said that, while he understands that Mrs. Trump has many other responsibilities as First Lady, “anything you can do to get cyberbullying to stop will be very much personally appreciated by me.”

“Please help,” he said, his voice quavering.

In an official statement released later in the day, the First Lady said that she had “kind of forgotten” about her campaign to stop cyberbullying but that she would “get right on it.”"

435,http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/dunkirk-a-war-movie-about-patriotic-ciphers,newyorker,“Dunkirk”: A War Movie About Patriotic Ciphers,[],"The outline of Christopher Nolan’s “Dunkirk” is a clever twist on a familiar trilogy: land, sea, and air. Nolan parses a week of combat during the Second World War, from May 26 through June 4, 1940, and the effort to rescue British and French troops into those three components, and gives each a time frame (a week, a day, an hour, respectively) that corresponds to its speed. The movie thus leaps about in time, with each thread of action moving ahead fitfully, until the three threads unite in the movie’s evident conclusion, the successful retreat of more than three hundred thousand soldiers (about two-thirds of them British, one-third French) across the English Channel from Dunkirk, France, to Great Britain. (The movie is centered on British soldiers; the French are a brief but melodramatic afterthought.) The preservation of this fighting force was, of course, crucial for the preservation of Great Britain and the eventual outcome of the war; the retreat was the defeat that helped to secure victory.

Nolan’s construction turns a forward tread into a mosaic and breaks the sense of a unified dramatic arc into a series of observational anecdotes, of isolated deeds and lonely confrontations. He highlights individual acts of courage and heroism, dependent on infinitesimal details of choice and chance, on which the overall historic event depends. In separating three through-lines and fields of action, Nolan suggests the uncertainty, the indeterminacy, the quasi-metaphysical randomness, and the seemingly miraculous synergy of disparate events of which the outcome was comprised. The hand of pure chance weighs heavily in the opening scene, for instance, which features one British soldier—who has just escaped a heavy-machine-gun barrage in the streets of Dunkirk—reaching the beach, where thousands of other soldiers are lined up and waiting to board ships. Suddenly, a German bomber roars overhead; the soldiers drop to a crouch, bombs fall, and some soldiers are blown to oblivion, while others get up and reassemble, bearing stretchers carrying the fallen toward ships.

That bloodless opening scene is the first sign that “Dunkirk” is no “Saving Private Ryan”; Nolan suppresses the mutilations and agonies of war to focus on its basic moral horror. (There’s only one brief scene of excruciating physical horror, involving fire in the water.) “Dunkirk” is a movie of paradox; its very subject is character, the mettle of men (and almost all of the characters, and all of the principal ones, are male) who, faced with decisions that could mean life or death for themselves and others, master their emotions and act thoughtfully, responsibly, honorably, potentially self-sacrificingly for the good of a collective mission that they’re all aware of: to get back to Great Britain in order to defend it against a likely attack by Germany. Yet Nolan doesn’t delve into their character at all—doesn’t at all consider any personal traits that foster such bravery. The film is, rather, both literally and figuratively, a collection of war stories—a set of anecdotes that stay rigorously within the context of battle, that emphasize the courage and the severity, the existential moment of war (and do so with a portentous shadowing of telling details) while showing nothing (actually nothing) of the soldiers outside the realm of battle.

It has been a recent trend in movies to blank out characters—to filter out thoughts and emotions that render them as complex individuals rather than visual-shorthand types. In many cases (as in “Baby Driver”and “War Machine”), this seems less a directorial choice than a lack of artistic imagination. In Nolan’s case, it’s something of a surprise: for all his jigsaw scripting and visual bombast, Nolan is also a director of backstory. He’s passionate about it (as in “Inception”) as about little else. I’ve been wondering whether, in “Dunkirk,” Nolan feels morally inhibited about ascribing to real-life characters and situations the depth of imagination that he feels free to pour into fictional ones. Yet I think that the blankness of his characters is a directorial decision—not merely the mark but the essence of his overarching artistic strategy.

With “Dunkirk,” Nolan has made what may be the first V.R. movie—one that does its best to put viewers literally into the position of combatants and participants in the Dunkirk rescue, as if viewers were meant to fill in the blanks of the characters’ inner lives with their own and imagine themselves to be fighting the Second World War for the very preservation of Great Britain. It isn’t (I suppose) that Nolan can’t or won’t conceive of that generations’ mental and personal life, but that he’s sufficiently awed by their achievements and wants to place viewers’ little feet into our predecessors’ giant shoes—to let us clomp around in them and imagine the strength that went into even the slightest step under those circumstances. “Dunkirk” is, in that sense, a war movie with a daddy complex. (Nolan differs in this regard from Steven Spielberg, who faces his cinematic father issues by trying on the big shoes himself.)

Of course, there’s much else from those times that is almost impossible to imagine. Many people today would agree that there’s something distinctive and world-historic about the Second World War, which has something to do with what’ s distinctive about the ideological differences between the two sides, between the values of the Allied powers and those of Nazism. But the Germans, let alone the Nazis, seem to have nothing to do with what Nolan’s characters are fighting for. The word “Nazi” is never heard; there’s no mention of Hitler; I don’t even think I heard the word “Germans” (once, someone refers to them by the British slang term “Jerries”). Nolan’s subject lies elsewhere, lies hidden—it’s his tribute to the collective purpose, the national unity, the total mobilization for a total war in which Britain’s very existence, the very existence of national culture, is at stake. Nolan achieves that paean to patriotic unity not by seeing and hearing it forged from multiplicity, but by excluding multiplicity, filtering out everything that isn’t already a part of it. In a weird and likely unintended way, the result is a tribute to the virtue-inspiring power of war.

The fastidiously severe images that are usually a watermark of Nolan’s willful artistry here give way to an anonymously practical recessiveness; rather than inflect his images, he lets the scale of his format, the 70mm. negative and the IMAX screen, do the bulk of the visual work. The next step in the movie’s immersive viewing might have been for cold water to wash along the aisles. Hans Zimmer’s absurdly overbearing music, which virtually bellows emotional commands at viewers, is matched by Nolan’s use of bass sounds—whether those of the music or of sound effects—that made the floor rumble and the seats shake at the IMAX screening I attended. The sensory overload of “Dunkirk” is also an anti-intellectual barrage that effaces the actual differences that were overcome with difficulty in pursuing the war—not just personal ones but also skepticism of bureaucracy, resentment of military discipline and hierarchy, social and political conflicts—the full spectrum of public discord that may have been muted in the midst of the war but that were detailed afterward by journalists, historians, and artists. (George Orwell’s wartime writings also give a sense of it.) “Dunkirk” seems, rather, like one of the self-censoring exhortations of wartime itself. Nolan’s sense of memory and of history is as flattened-out and untroubled as his sense of psychology and of character.

When it comes to watching movies, I’m format-agnostic. It’s a pleasure to see movies projected in public on the big screen. The air section of “Dunkirk,” in particular, is a visual wonder—less because Nolan’s direction of the sequences is distinctive than because solo flight in combat is irresistibly, sensuously fascinating to watch, and has been so since William Wellman’s “Wings” (1927) and Howard Hawks’s “The Dawn Patrol” and Howard Hughes’s “Hell’s Angels” (both from 1930)—and the expanse of sky is all the more engulfing, thrilling, terrifying on a screen the size of an apartment building. But it’s also a pleasure to watch movies, even visually daring movies, at home, on TV or even a computer, and pause to savor, freeze frames, back up, and watch scenes again, or even watch some parts backward. There are differences between the feelings aroused by different modes of viewing—but the differences are different from film to film, and a movie that seems good in one format will always seem so (if differently) in another. Except, perhaps, for “Dunkirk,” which, if it’s not seen in enveloping and engulfing and body-shaking scale, may be nothing at all."

Maggie Haberman covered Donald Trump years ago for the New York tabloids. Now, in the White House, she has a front-row seat to an Administration unlike any other— uniquely hostile to the media, publically, but uniquely open to leaking, in private. The dysfunction goes deep. “We are used to a team of rivals,” Haberman tells David Remnick. “We are not used to a team of the Bloods and Crips, which is essentially what this is, in the White House. These are rival gangs.”"
437,http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/stuart-hall-and-the-rise-of-cultural-studies,newyorker,Stuart Hall and the Rise of Cultural Studies,[],"In the summer of 1983, the Jamaican scholar Stuart Hall, who lived and taught in England, travelled to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, to deliver a series of lectures on something called “Cultural Studies.” At the time, many academics still considered the serious study of popular culture beneath them; a much starker division existed, then, between what Hall termed the “authenticated, validated” tastes of the upper classes and the unrefined culture of the masses. But Hall did not regard this hierarchy as useful. Culture, he argued, does not consist of what the educated élites happen to fancy, such as classical music or the fine arts. It is, simply, “experience lived, experience interpreted, experience defined.” And it can tell us things about the world, he believed, that more traditional studies of politics or economics alone could not.

A masterful orator, Hall energized the audience in Illinois, a group of thinkers and writers from around the world who had gathered for a summer institute devoted to parsing Marxist approaches to cultural analysis. A young scholar named Jennifer Daryl Slack believed she was witnessing something special and decided to tape and transcribe the lectures. After more than a decade of coaxing, Hall finally agreed to edit these transcripts for publication, a process that took years. The result is “ Cultural Studies 1983: A Theoretical History ,” which was published, last fall, as part of an ongoing Duke University Press series called “Stuart Hall: Selected Writings,” chronicling the career and influence of Hall, who died in 2014.

Broadly speaking, cultural studies is not one arm of the humanities so much as an attempt to use all of those arms at once. It emerged in England, in the nineteen-fifties and sixties, when scholars from working-class backgrounds, such as Richard Hoggart and Raymond Williams, began thinking about the distance between canonical cultural touchstones—the music or books that were supposed to teach you how to be civil and well-mannered—and their own upbringings. These scholars believed that the rise of mass communications and popular forms were permanently changing our relationship to power and authority, and to one another. There was no longer consensus. Hall was interested in the experience of being alive during such disruptive times. What is culture, he proposed, but an attempt to grasp at these changes, to wrap one’s head around what is newly possible?

Hall retained faith that culture was a site of “negotiation,” as he put it, a space of give and take where intended meanings could be short-circuited. “Popular culture is one of the sites where this struggle for and against a culture of the powerful is engaged: it is also the stake to be won or lost in that struggle,” he argues. “It is the arena of consent and resistance.” In a free society, culture does not answer to central, governmental dictates, but it nonetheless embodies an unconscious sense of the values we share, of what it means to be right or wrong. Over his career, Hall became fascinated with theories of “reception”—how we decode the different messages that culture is telling us, how culture helps us choose our own identities. He wasn’t merely interested in interpreting new forms, such as film or television, using the tools that scholars had previously brought to bear on literature. He was interested in understanding the various political, economic, or social forces that converged in these media. It wasn’t merely the content or the language of the nightly news, or middlebrow magazines, that told us what to think; it was also how they were structured, packaged, and distributed.

According to Slack and Lawrence Grossberg, the editors of “Cultural Studies 1983,” Hall was reluctant to publish these lectures because he feared they would be read as an all-purpose critical toolkit rather than a series of carefully situated historical conversations. Hall himself was ambivalent about what he perceived to be the American fetish for theory, a belief that intellectual work was merely, in Slack and Grossberg’s words, a “search for the right theory which, once found, would unlock the secrets of any social reality.” It wasn’t this simple. (I have found myself wondering what Hall would make of how cultural criticism of a sort that can read like ideological pattern-recognition has proliferated in the age of social media.)

Over the course of his lectures, Hall carefully wrestles with forebears, including the British scholar F. R. Leavis and also Williams and Hoggart (the latter founded Birmingham University’s influential Center for Contemporary Cultural Studies, which Hall directed in the seventies). Gradually, the lectures cluster around questions of how we give our lives meaning, how we recognize and understand “the culture we never see, the culture we don’t think of as cultivated.” These lectures aren’t instructions for “doing” cultural studies—until the very end, they barely touch on emerging cultural forms that intrigued Hall, such as reggae and punk rock. Instead, they try to show how far back these questions reach."

Educated at a school in Queens

whose slim roster of celebrated alums

boasts Don Rickles number one,

my mother knew little about art,

but she took me to a show

where she withdrew into private air

on seeing “The Potato Eaters”

and “Three Pairs of Shoes”

because the shoes resembled my grandmother’s

high-topped boots my mother knelt before

and laced up every morning

after applying salve

to those diabetes-ulcerated shins.

And the potatoes recalled the fires

she and her brothers built

against the curb:

charred skin, raw at the center,

and called “mickeys” in honor of the Irish.

My mother pointed out how the poor

have only potatoes for dinner, their faces

so rough they looked unearthed themselves.

And the shoes, ravaged by labor. Unlike Heidegger,

who said of “Three Pairs of Shoes,”

“From the dark opening of the worn insides

the toilsome tread of the worker stares forth,”

and utterly unlike Derrida, whose note on that painting

questioned what “constitutes a pair of shoes and how

the elements of such combine different forms of reality,”

my mother said they show how hard some people work."
439,http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/a-new-kind-of-adultery-novel,newyorker,A New Kind of Adultery Novel,[],"In 2015, The Dublin Review ran a goodbye-to-all-that essay by Sally Rooney, a young Irish writer, about her brief career as a university debater. A couple of years earlier, as a student at Trinity College, Dublin, Rooney had risen through the ranks of the European circuit to become the No. 1 debater on the Continent, but she wrote about her feats the way a recovering alcoholic might look back on a time of sotted carousing, at once proud of her exploits and appalled by the person she had been while having them. What Rooney loved about debating was entering a state of “flow,” that magical mental hum when disparate facts and ideas effortlessly assembled themselves in her mind and poured from her mouth as argument. Yet she was also disturbed by her talent for advocating morally dubious positions, like capitalism’s benefits for the poor, or “things oppressed people should do about their oppression.” She quit after winning the championship. “Maybe I stopped debating to see if I could still think of things to say when there weren’t any prizes,” she wrote.

She could. Rooney is now twenty-six and, after earning a master’s in American literature and publishing a few short stories, has just come out with her first novel, “ Conversations with Friends ” (Hogarth). There are prizes for fiction, it’s true, but writing it is a private performance: you judge yourself first on your own stage, by your own rules. Rooney turns out to be as intelligent and agile a novelist as she apparently was a debater, and for many of the same reasons. As its title promises, Rooney’s book glitters with talk, much of it between Frances, the novel’s narrator, and Bobbi, her best friend, two Trinity students supremely gifted in the collegiate sport of competitive banter. Observations, theories, and quips about the world fly between the friends like so many shuttlecocks in a conversation that never ends, because conversations, in our world of screens, don’t have to. They just change format, so that a discussion begun in person continues through texts or e-mails or, as in the following dialogue, instant messages:

Bobbi: if you look at love as something other than an interpersonal phenomenon Bobbi: and try to understand it as a social value system Bobbi: it’s both antithetical to capitalism, in that it challenges the axiom of selfishness Bobbi: which dictates the whole logic of inequality Bobbi: and yet also it’s subservient and facilitatory Bobbi: i.e. mothers selflessly raising children without any profit motive Bobbi: which seems to contradict the demands of the market at one level Bobbi: and yet actually just functions to provide workers for free me: yes me: capitalism harnesses “love” for profit me: love is the discursive practice and unpaid labour is the effect me: but I mean, I get that, I’m anti love as such Bobbi: that’s vapid frances Bobbi: you have to do more than say you’re anti things.

This exchange, so rigorously serious as to be comic, calls to mind another pair of brilliant Dublin students, Cranly and Stephen Dedalus, who stroll around in “ A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man ,” arguing over the Eucharist and apostasy. Cranly and Dedalus came of age in an Ireland riven by religious strife, Bobbi and Frances in an Ireland gutted by the 2008 financial collapse. Capitalism is to Rooney’s young women what Catholicism was to Joyce’s young men, a rotten national faith to contend with, though how exactly to resist capitalism, when it has sunk its teeth so deep into the human condition, remains an open question. To be “anti love,” as Frances declares herself, is as ideologically satisfying as it is emotionally untenable, a weak position that Bobbi pounces on with startling pitilessness.

Frances’s disavowal of love strikes a poignant note, too, for Bobbi was her girlfriend before she became her friend. At the convent high school where they met, Bobbi was a cigarette-smoking contrarian with a pierced nose who freaked out her square classmates and pissed off her teachers. (Her coup de grâce was scrawling “fuck the patriarchy” next to a wall-mounted crucifix.) Frances remembers how, when she was seventeen, Bobbi approached her at a school dance, “radiantly attractive” as she swigged vodka from a bottle of Coke, to ask if Frances liked girls: “It was very easy to act unfazed around her. I just said: sure.”

The relationship lasted for more than a year, and though Frances doesn’t explain why it ended, the friends’ intimacy still has the all-absorbing intensity of romance, as well as its thorny imbalances of power and temperament. Bobbi is the clear star of the pair, beautiful and puckishly charismatic, with a suffer-no-fools bravado that, as Frances says, “could be abrasive and unrestrained in a way that made people uncomfortable, while I tended to be encouragingly polite. Mothers always liked me a lot, for example.” So do men. At the open-mike nights around Dublin where the friends perform spoken-word poetry together, Bobbi ignores any guy who tries to chat them up, leaving him to Frances. “I enjoyed playing this kind of character, the smiling girl,” Frances confesses, but Bobbi considers such agreeableness to be pandering. “Bobbi told me she thought I didn’t have ‘a real personality,’ but she said she meant it as a compliment. Mostly I agreed with her assessment.”

The novel opens at one of these poetry nights, in early summer, where Frances and Bobbi meet Melissa, an established writer and photographer in her thirties. They are familiar with her work; Melissa, impressed with what she has just seen of theirs, invites them back to her house for a nightcap. As Bobbi entertains their host with clever conversation, Frances takes stock of her large, comfortable home, casing it like a thief. Melissa has money, Frances concludes. She also has a husband: Nick, an actor, whom Frances finds “handsome in the most generic way”— a strong, silent hunk with a soft mouth and good cheekbones who looks great without a shirt on, as she discovers later, clicking through images of him on Google. The pictures are old, from cancelled soaps and second-rate films; Nick’s career has never quite taken off. It seems impossible to imagine that he could be the equal of cerebral, impressive Melissa.

There’s an aura of seduction to the boozy night with Melissa. Soon after, she e-mails Frances and Bobbi to suggest profiling them as literary up-and-comers for a local magazine. Flattered, they accept, and as they spend more time with Melissa and Nick, eating dinner at their house, socializing at book launches, a fraught dynamic begins to take shape. Though Frances is the writer—it is her work that the friends perform—Melissa clearly prefers Bobbi, with whom she establishes a rapport of cozy, mutual infatuation. Frances, excluded and hurt, finds herself thrown together with Nick, the other neglected partner in this odd four-person dance. He’s far sharper and subtler than his looks suggest, with a quiet, tentative quality she finds surprising in so masculine a man. “He was the first person I had met since Bobbi who made me enjoy conversation, in the same irrational and sensuous way I enjoyed coffee or loud music,” Frances thinks, though the tone that she and Nick take with each other is so relentlessly sardonic that neither is sure if the flirtation is serious. It is. At Melissa’s birthday party, they kiss. Frances flees in confused shame, but when she returns, a few days later, it is to his bed. “I might never be able to speak again after this,” she thinks, in stunned ecstasy, as he begins to touch her—a frightening thought for someone so used to protecting herself with language, and a freeing one, too. In spite of herself, Frances has stumbled straight into a love story."
440,http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/panoramas-contemporary-scope,newyorker,Panorama’s Contemporary Scope,[],"Modern music festivals affirm the contemporary. They celebrate a cluster of artists, sounds, and songs that appeal broadly enough and affect deeply enough to gather thousands of people and generate millions of dollars in one weekend. Coachella, the greatest of the great lawns, has grown into a coveted pilgrimage and routinely sells huge numbers of tickets before the bill is even announced. Last year, its organizers eyed the city for a second outpost: Panorama débuted amid small controversy, set to take place on Randall’s Island just a few weeks after the long-standing Governors Ball. “Scheduling two same-genre festivals on top of each other like this makes it difficult for either to provide the maximum benefit to its fans, its neighbors, and taxpayers,” Tom Russell, a Governors Ball co-founder, told Billboard . But Panorama went on as planned; local permit politics mattered little to ticket holders, who probably would have trekked to Flushing Meadows for such a stacked lineup, which ranged from Arcade Fire to Kendrick Lamar to LCD Soundsystem.

This year, some seventy singers, rappers, musicians, and d.j.s will set up and break down across Panorama’s three days, July 28-30. Standouts include MGMT, Girl Talk, Breakbot, and Justice, all part of a generation of indie and electronic twiddlers who restructured pop into a bottom-up format a decade ago—MGMT’s “Electric Feel” and Justice’s “D.A.N.C.E.” have proved evergreen, and their brimming appeal arguably set the tone for the current Spotify sound. Angel Olsen, Future Islands, Mitski, Cherry Glazerr, and Bleached are among the names bolstering college rock today, a scene oscillating between folk and punk, but glossier than traditional images of both, and undoubtedly more female. Like those bands, the rappers Vince Staples, Noname, and 24hrs have yet to enjoy the kind of tentpole hits that reach outside their base; still, a steady stream of output has made their divergent sounds—schizophrenic L.A. rap, soft-shell hip-hop soul, and bludgeoning Southern bounce, respectively—speak to many of the same kids.

But few voices speak louder than Frank Ocean’s, and with so few words. The young singer-songwriter plays his first stateside set since the release of “Blonde,” his dazzling third full-length. Reports from the Lovebox Festival, in the U.K., where Ocean appeared earlier this month, described opacity and elusion; trailed by Spike Jonze with camera in hand, Ocean performed mostly new material in even newer ways, touching only on “Thinkin Bout You” from his best-known album, “Channel Orange.” His controversial old pal Tyler, the Creator is back in the public eye as well—Panorama will be his first show since the début of a new record, “Flower Boy,” which plays on his dual personas of agit-rap anarchist and misunderstood nostalgist while hinting at even more layers. After appearances by Solange and Tame Impala, Sunday sets from Nine Inch Nails and A Tribe Called Quest close out the weekend—two iconic groups who have recently offered new material, diving brow-first into the present while retaining their trademark textures. ♦"

443,http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/the-tv-that-created-donald-trump,newyorker,The TV That Created Donald Trump,[],"For months, it felt easier to avoid watching Donald Trump on television. It was like sniffing spoiled milk: you didn’t need a sip to know it was bad. Then, in June, the President held the first meeting of his complete Cabinet. It aired live, as Trump’s early campaign rallies had, in full and without commentary, on CNN. Wearing a striped tie that rhymed with the flag behind him, Trump sat at a massive table, smiling. “Mike?” Trump said, and Vice-President Pence took the cue. “Thank you, Mr. President. It is the greatest privilege of my life to serve as Vice-President to a President who is keeping his word to the American people.” As cameras clicked like cicadas, each appointee offered up an homage; Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, thanked Trump for the “opportunity and the blessing that you’ve given us to serve your agenda.” Many compared the spectacle to something out of North Korea. But it was also a near-replica of a production closer to home. It’s become a wearying, ugly observation, a media truism at once superficial and deep: if “The Apprentice” didn’t get Trump elected, it is surely what made him electable. Over fourteen seasons, the television producer Mark Burnett helped turn the Donald Trump of the late nineties—the disgraced huckster who had trashed Atlantic City; a tabloid pariah to whom no bank would lend—into a titan of industry, nationally admired for being, in his own words, “the highest-quality brand.” And here we were again, at the boardroom table, listening to the compliments to the boss, suspended in that eerie, unstable blend of improvisation and scripting. It was enough to make a television critic nostalgic. As it happens, most episodes of Trump on “The Apprentice” are curiously hard to find: they’re not available to stream or download. Only first-season DVDs are for sale, legally, online—and only used ones. The show is not at the Paley Center for Media’s research library, either. (M-G-M, which owns the rights, declined to comment.) To watch, you’ll need occult methods. But at the Paley you can catch something nearly as illuminating: a video of a panel discussion about the show, from 2004, following its first season. It was filmed the day after “The Apprentice” lost the Emmy for best reality show to “The Amazing Race.” The moderator is the “Access Hollywood” host Billy Bush, who, a year later, played Trump’s wingman in the pussy-grabbing tape. Trump, in a dark suit, leans forward in his chair, hands clasped. Mark Burnett, wearing jeans and a shell necklace, lounges next to him. Both are aglow. A year earlier, NBC, whose TV programming was then run by Jeff Zucker, had been in free fall, with the hit sitcom “Friends” about to end and nothing to replace it. Burnett and Trump had provided Zucker with a hat trick: the network’s first strong reality franchise; a solution for its Must-See TV Thursday slot; and a lure for ads from corporations like Pepsi and Microsoft. Bush asks surprisingly tough questions: he wonders whether Burnett softened Trump with an image “makeover”; he talks about whether reality television is a fad, and whether it’s cruel; and he asks what it felt like to lose the Emmy. As the drip of praise slows, Trump shows flashes of sourness, griping about old enemies, like the host of “The View”—“this fat slob Joy Behar who can’t stand me.” Burnett never wavers. A brilliant entrepreneur, and one of the most powerful men in television, he had produced “Survivor,” on CBS, which exploded the economics and aesthetics of television, launching a transformative new genre. “The Apprentice” was the savvy workplace variation that he pitched to Trump in 2002. And yet Burnett presents himself, whether humbly or cannily, as Trump’s acolyte: Robin to Trump’s Batman, he insists. Then he casts Trump in a fresh light, years before the 2016 campaign. Trump, Burnett explains, struck him as “a real American maverick tycoon.” Donald “will say whatever he wants.” He “takes no prisoners. If you’re Donald’s friend, he’ll defend you all day long. If you’re not, he’s going to kill you. And that’s very American. He’s like the guys who built the West. America is the one country that supports the entire world—because of guys like Donald, who create jobs and a tax base that can support the entire planet.” That’s what “The Apprentice” means to him, the producer concludes, with a grin: it’s “a love letter from me to America, and to New York City, because we chose New York City, about what makes America great.”

In a 1981 segment of “Rona Barrett Looks at Today’s Super Rich,” the gossip columnist asks the thirty-four-year-old Trump if he’d consider a run for President. Trump laments that television has ruined politics, to the extent that Abraham Lincoln could no longer get elected: “He was not a handsome man and he did not smile at all.” He skirts questions about his political pull, his controversial tax abatements. With his cold eyes, baby cheeks, and rosebud mouth, he resembles James Spader—silky and guarded, a Master of the Universe in a boxy brown suit. Throughout the eighties, as Trump built Trump Tower, then the Javits Center, helping to make Manhattan into a luxury playground, he played himself on television. He was omnipresent in pop culture, often as a punch line. He was the “short-fingered vulgarian” of Spy and the inspiration for the bully-villain of “Back to the Future Part II.” But on TV he had swagger: in 1985, he feuded with Mayor Ed Koch on “60 Minutes”; he was a sharp-dressed landlord on the Judith Krantz miniseries “I’ll Take Manhattan”; he appeared briefly in a 1983 “This Old House” episode about Trump Tower. There were numerous appearances on David Letterman, and the time when he asked Larry King, “Do you mind if I sit back a little bit, because your breath is very bad. . . . Has this ever been told to you before?” (King laughed, shocked, and then analyzed Trump’s neg: “That’s how you get the edge.”) Early on, Trump had greater self-control than he had as a candidate, but he couldn’t quite crack the likability factor—and, maybe, he didn’t want to. Long before Tony Soprano launched the anti-hero drama, Trump was that guy. He was a handsome go-getter, but also an arrogant self-promoter, proud of his toughness, a flirt with a fat wallet. On “60 Minutes,” he complains about media coverage. “I believe they like to make me out as somebody a little more sinister than I really am,” he tells Mike Wallace. “I don’t look at myself, necessarily, as being sinister.” In 1990, Trump appeared on a game show called “Trump Card,” set at Trump’s Castle, in Atlantic City. As his life became unstable, rocked by divorces and bankruptcies, his TV persona stayed flush. He made cameos on sitcoms: on a 1994 episode of “The Fresh Prince of Bel Air” (Carlton faints in admiration); on a 1996 episode of “The Nanny” (he dates Fran). In 1999, he ruined a perfectly good episode of “Sex and the City.” In these incarnations, Trump is a Manhattan fixture. And yet it feels as though he’s shrunk to a fun-size Trump: red tie, yellow hair, “the Donald.” He’s less an icon than he is a retro cartoon. By the turn of this century, in the eyes of New Yorkers, all that remained of the once powerful developer was his logo. This was when he began to reinvent himself as a star in new genres: reality television, pro wrestling, and cable news, particularly Fox News. These combative art forms suited his style—flamboyant and vaudevillian. When Trump first entered TV, the entire medium had been dismissed as junk. Now, even as critics were swooning over the artistry of cable drama, Trump swerved deeper, into stranger regions, straight into the types of television that nobody took seriously, the ones dismissed as guilty pleasures.

When Burnett pitched Trump to NBC, it was as the host of only the first season of “The Apprentice”; after him, new tycoons, including Mark Cuban and Martha Stewart, were supposed to step in. According to the book “Trump Revealed” (2016), by Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher, the plan quickly changed. Trump’s comfort on camera, his ability to improvise—including the “You’re fired!” tagline—cemented his value, as did the strong first-season ratings. Burnett conceived of the show as “Survivor” in the “urban jungle,” and it became NBC’s flagship. Trump’s relationship with viewers was transformed: “He was a hero, and he had not been one before,” Jim Dowd, then NBC’s publicity director, told Kranish and Fisher. Rewatching “The Apprentice” more than a decade later, it’s easy to see why it struck a chord. Glossy and upbeat, the show, which débuted after 9/11 but before the economic collapse, introduced itself as a stirring advertisement for Wall Street as a meritocracy. Each episode opens with the earworm “For the Love of Money,” by the O’Jays, with its “moneymoneymoneymoney” groove: “Talk about cash money! / Dollar bills, y’all . . . For that lean lean lean mean green / Almighty dollar.” The credits feature a dazzling, supersaturated montage of Manhattan, studded with Trump logos, along with cabs, clocks, sped-up clouds. The names of contestants glide by, in neon, formatted as Wall Street tickers. In the voice-over that begins the pilot, Trump recasts his failures as triumphs: “I fought back and won—big league. I used my brain. I used my negotiating skills.” Now he will teach us to do the same. The show’s early contestants were bona-fide strivers, with business backgrounds, not show-biz wannabes. In Season 1, there’s a nerd, Sam Solovey, who moons over Trump like a stalker; and there’s the villainous, dishonest Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth, who became a breakout star (and, once Trump was elected, assistant to the President in the White House). But the contest narrows to a white Loyola graduate named Bill Rancic and an African-American Harvard M.B.A., Kwame Jackson. As Joshua Green points out, in his book, “Devil’s Bargain,” “The Apprentice” attracted an unusually high percentage of black and Latino viewers, in part because it highlighted contestants from those groups not as criminals but as entrepreneurs. It also featured contestants from Asian, Indian, and Middle Eastern backgrounds, and, in Season 5, recent immigrants. But race is rarely explicitly discussed. Gender is, all the time. In fact, from a certain angle, the show resembles a “Lean In” feminist boot camp. In this utopian twist on Wall Street, half the players are female, and, initially, all are on the same team. Together, they strategize about how to work with their eccentric male boss and his icy female lieutenant (in later seasons, Trump’s daughter Ivanka). He’s a supportive mentor, but he’s also prone to saying things like “You’re all beautiful women. Do you think you had an advantage over the men, in selling ice cream?” The show’s early “challenges” are sweetly low-key: in the pilot, the players hawk lemonade—no brand names are visible. As with most reality shows, a huge proportion of the series consists of facial expressions—apprehension, disgust, glee—with musical cues, to heighten tiny conflicts. But each episode ends in grandeur, when Trump arrives to pass judgment. First, the losing team deconstructs its failings. Then three candidates grovel before him. Finally, one gets fired, and descends in a golden elevator. These final sequences take place in a boardroom so dimly lit that stripes of shadow pass over the contestants’ faces, as if they were crossing into the underworld. In many ways, “The Apprentice” is a classic reality show of the era, a sleek blend of game show, documentary, and soap opera, spiked with comedy. And yet “The Apprentice” is also “classy,” in Trumpian terms: no one eats bugs or gets too drunk. It’s a fun, upscale fantasy, a voguing competition in executive realness. “You jest.” In one way, however, it departs radically from reality: no one criticizes the boss. Instead, the Trump of “The Apprentice” receives endless praise, even behind his back. All scandal and debt are erased; Trump’s combative streak is alchemized into Daddy’s tough love. Celebrities who sign up for reality shows often agree to be made fun of. On “The Apprentice,” while Trump is outrageous, he’s rarely ridiculous: if he insults people, they deserve it (and often love it). He’s a family man and a business genius. Contestants are grateful for his attention, even negative attention, since he could be off doing deals. Frequently, he narrates from a helicopter, hovering like Zeus. Early on, the prizes are tied to Trump’s biography: a visit to his Louis Quatorze apartment (which he describes as being generally reserved for “Presidents and kings”), to meet his then girlfriend, Melania; dinner at the 21 Club, where the winner is seated at the “Fred Trump table.” In the finale, the winner chooses which Trump property to help manage. Often, the winners—who do, in fact, go on to work for Trump, with a salary of $250,000—tell him that they’ve chosen the project that will let them be “closer to you.” The Trump of “The Apprentice” is not a wholly foreign figure. In the second episode, he practically pulls the advertising C.E.O. Donny Deutsch off his feet with a handshake. He rates women’s looks reflexively. He’s also hung up on eugenics, an unspoken contradiction of the show’s meritocratic themes. In one episode, Sam is interrogated in the boardroom. “You don’t believe in the genetic pool? That what you have, you have?” Trump asks Sam. “I’ve got genetic pool big-time, Mr. Trump!” Sam insists, gesticulating. “Just like you got from your father, Fred Trump, and your mother, Mary Trump.” Trump determines who has a “lousy personality” and who “is not very well liked”—this comes up most often with women, especially in the show’s final rounds. He can be crude. “This suit is really gross,” he says, dangling a skimpy bathing suit, designed by a black gay contestant. Yet the negativity doesn’t linger. “The Apprentice” is set in a patriotic world of capitalist potential, where the boss takes you in a helicopter to view the Empire State Building (he boasts, deceptively, about his stake in it), and to gaze at the sunset-lit Statue of Liberty, which is, in Trump’s telling, “one of the truly beautiful symbols of anything, anywhere in the world.” In an emotional voice-over, the contestant Adam Israelov speaks about his immigrant father, who arrived with “nothing in his pocket.” “Not bad, Adam,” Trump says. “If you make a lot of money, this”—he gestures at their private aerie—“is the way you’re going to live.”

After Season 1, the ratings began to drop. Each year, Trump obsessed over and lied about them, needling reporters who cited them. Even during the 2004 Paley panel, which took place just over a week into the second season, Trump complained that the show’s launch did better because in January “everyone was watching TV,” whereas, in September, “everyone was playing golf.” As cable began its ascent, Trump clung tightly to network values: quality measured only by ad dollars and Nielsen ratings. The producers began to fiddle with the recipe. The second season stuck with the men against the women; the next tried “street smarts” versus “book smarts.” Then back to a battle of the sexes, then no categories, with the contestants instead advertised as “personally selected by Trump.” He had other ideas: in 2005, Entertainment Weekly reported that he wanted to pit black contestants against white ones. (“Whether people like that idea or not, it is somewhat reflective of our very vicious world,” he explained later.) The sixth season jumped to Los Angeles, where each week’s winning team (the Haves) lived in a mansion and the losers (the Have-nots) in a “tent city.” Each year, the challenges got less creative; often, contestants were simply deputized to promote a sponsor. Trump seemed crankier and nastier. He more frequently called people “losers,” “quitters,” “pathetic.” In 2007, NBC dropped “The Apprentice” from its fall schedule. In what felt like a preëmptive strike, Trump announced new reality-TV projects, without Burnett. There was “Pageant Place,” for MTV, about an apartment full of beauty queens. And there was “Lady or a Tramp,” a Fox series in which “rude and crude” party girls were sent to finishing school—a concept that, over two years, morphed into the Britishized show “The Girls of Hedsor Hall.” The host was Tara Conner, a former Miss USA, to whom Trump had given a second chance after she broke pageant rules. The comedian Rosie O’Donnell accused him of hypocrisy—who was the womanizing Trump to judge? During a press conference for the show, in 2009, Trump spun the incident into a crass rant, speculating about O’Donnell’s motivations: “Tara, I hate to tell you this, for reasons you don’t want to know about, but Rosie would have given you a second , third , and fourth chance, O.K.? And she would’ve loved every minute of it.” Neither series lasted more than a season. This lurid display was a striking break from “The Apprentice.” But Trump was also embracing yet another role, one that let him play out his most aggressive and debasing impulses: a spot in the pro-wrestling ring, an industry he’d supported since 1988, when he sponsored the W.W.E. event WrestleMania. The first W.W.E. Trump-based story was a bout between wrestlers dressed up as “Trump” and “Rosie,” a one-time experiment that flopped with fans. Then, the spring that “The Apprentice” vanished from NBC, Trump himself entered the ring as a W.W.E. character—a preening, crudely macho version of his role on “The Apprentice.” In the story, “Mr. Trump” arrives to vanquish his former friend Vince McMahon, the insecure tyrant who owns the W.W.E. Trump is introduced as an Oz-like face on a giant screen, as “For the Love of Money” plays and dollar bills tumble from the rafters. (McMahon’s money, not Trump’s.) Their showdown is more of a bro-down: Trump brags that his “Trump Towers” are bigger than McMahon’s “grapefruits.” The audience might be rooting for Trump, McMahon says, “but ninety-five per cent of them are idiots.” Trump replies, “To me, they look like a very smart group of people.” Wrestling—even more than reality TV—makes anyone who describes it sound like a lunatic. But the series climax, “Battle of the Billionaires,” is so campily homoerotic, so rife with heat and humiliation, that it’s a critic-proof fever dream. “It’s the hostile takeover of Donald Trump!” announcers shriek, as Trump pounds McMahon. Trump’s “second” in the ring is a near-naked black wrestler named Bobby Lashley. McMahon is represented in the ring by Umaga, a Samoan who grunts and screams. When Trump wins, he shaves McMahon’s head. Trump might have forged a different path on television, as a libidinous Barnum. Instead, in 2007, just before the economy crashed, NBC revived his old show as “The Celebrity Apprentice.” The reboot was glitzier, more circus-like. The ensemble now comprised C-level celebrities: wrestlers and lesser-known country singers; piggish guys like the rock star Gene Simmons, who bonded with Trump over women; and various others, among them the singer Cyndi Lauper, the athlete Darryl Strawberry, and the disgraced Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich. Rather than compete for a job, the contestants raised money for charities, often by pestering more famous friends. The professional poker player Annie Duke gives to Refugees International, interviewing an Iraqi translator who had difficulty getting visas for her children; Simmons to the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation. The original show had painted the bankrupt Trump as a respected mogul; “The Celebrity Apprentice” made the tightwad a philanthropist. During Season 5, Trump filmed a special boardroom segment with Ignacio, a child beneficiary of the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Ignacio, from Milwaukee, had won an essay contest on “Why I’m Proud to Be Bilingual.” His “wish” is to be fired by Trump. Instead, the host praises him and hands him a check. For all the do-gooder icing, the deeper shift was toward more aggressive product integration. As always, Trump touts his hotels and resorts, his water and his ties; and the celebrities do the same for their albums and perfumes. The human brands praise the corporate ones, which benefit by association with the charitable ones. The structure echoes that of the Trump Foundation: each week, money is funnelled to philanthropy under Trump’s name, though none of it is donated by him. Whereas the original “Apprentice” bore some resemblance to Wall Street training, “The Celebrity Apprentice” was sheer shilling: its sponsors paid from five million to nine million dollars for a slot, according to an estimation by Ad Age . “There’s never been another show where you’ve had a product sold for two hours,” Trump told the magazine, in 2011. “They do a 30-second commercial, but where do they do two hours?” The value of those products was another matter. In one episode, about identity theft (“a yuge problem,” Trump says), the sponsors are Norton and Lifelock, a subscription online-security service based in Tempe, Arizona. The challenge is to create an advertorial in Time . In a particularly delightful moment, Blagojevich worries that they’re misusing the term “bank fraud” in their copy. The episode aired on March 28, 2010. Nineteen days earlier, the F.T.C. had fined Lifelock twelve million dollars for deceptive business practices and for failing to secure sensitive customer data. In 2015, the company was ordered to pay a hundred million dollars after failing to meet security standards. In the third episode of Season 7, “Outside the Box,” the client is Kodak, which also sponsored the season, creating miniature “Kodak moments.” In January, 2007, when the episode aired, Kodak was veering toward collapse, owing to the rise of digital photography. But, on “The Celebrity Apprentice,” Kodak appeared to be a gleaming model of vigorous corporate muscle, a company that had “reinvested in digital.” The two contestant teams—Empresario and Hydra—are assigned to create Airstream trailers touting the company’s printer ink. Inspecting the project is a guest judge, Jim Cramer, the investment-plugging host of “Mad Money,” on CNBC. He greets the country-music star Trace Adkins by saying, “How’s business?” Trace drawls back, “Well, you know, I’ve got a stock tip for you, man.” As Cramer smiles encouragingly, Adkins explains that, once he’s “done exposing the world to what the Kodak Easyshare will do,” the stock will be “through the roof.” In the boardroom, Simmons is mocked for talking back to the clients when they reject his slogan, “It’s a Kodak World.” “Talk your way out of this one, big boy!” the British pundit Piers Morgan scoffs. “Mate, you say Kodak’s wrong. Kodak’s the biggest success story in America right now.” In the end, Trump fires Simmons. Two years later, the company posted a hundred-and-thirty-seven-million-dollar loss. In 2012, it filed for bankruptcy."

During the Second World War, a million women served in the Soviet Army. This remarkable collection of testimonies, translated into English for the first time, is the earliest, and the most earnest, of the Nobel laureate’s chronicles of Soviet and post-Soviet lives. Sitting at kitchen tables, Alexievich coaxes out of the women stories that describe a reality vastly different from the officially sanctioned version, with its glorifying tidiness. She asks them, “Was there love during the war?,” and what was it like, when death was so near? They speak guardedly but vividly of fleeting encounters, deep relationships, unexpressed feelings. To the women, love was “the only personal event in wartime. All the rest is common—even death.”

Hunger , by Roxane Gay (HarperCollins) . “The story of my body is not a story of triumph,” Gay declares at the outset of her powerful, unvarnished memoir. After being gang-raped by a classmate and his friends at the age of twelve, Gay began to gain weight. Now she is what doctors call “super morbidly obese.” Threaded through the book are musings on fatness and its place in contemporary culture, in TV shows like “The Biggest Loser” and in the craze for weight-loss surgery. Although Gay is a celebrated writer, she resists characterizing her life as a straightforward success. Her memoir is often repetitive, but its vulnerability is spellbinding. “Here I am showing you the ferocity of my hunger,” Gay writes. There is a triumph in that.

Flesh and Bone and Water , by Luiza Sauma (Scribner) . This mysterious début novel begins with a letter to André Cabral, a middle-aged doctor from Brazil, working in London, from Luana, his former maid’s daughter—a girl with eyes like “trampled leaves.” It is his first contact with her since he left for England, when he was eighteen, soon after his mother died in a car accident. Flashbacks depict André’s life in the following years, and his intimate and uneasy relationship to Luana and to the Brazilian class structure. Though the narrative relies too heavily on Cabral, Brazil is marvellously conjured: full of hot, smoky sunrises and manioc pancakes, chilled coconut milk and “the salty violence of Ipanema.”

Little Sister , by Barbara Gowdy (Tin House) . During a particularly rainy week in Toronto, whenever a thunderstorm hits, Rose, a thirty-four-year-old who runs a dilapidated movie theatre, is transported out of her body and into that of Harriet, a beautiful and depressed book editor who is secretly pregnant by a married man. For Rose, being in Harriet’s body is a thrilling respite from caring for her mother, who has dementia, and from her boyfriend, who is an overbearing bore. It also allows her to access new memories of her sister and the circumstances of her death, when they were young. Any qualms about the novel’s strange premise are swept away by Gowdy’s finely balanced prose; we are as entrenched in the characters’ lives as Rose is in Harriet’s body."

451,http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/sadiq-khan-takes-on-brexit-and-terror,newyorker,Sadiq Khan Takes On Brexit and Terror,[],"Fourteen months ago, the election of Sadiq Khan, who is forty-six, to be the first Muslim mayor of a Western metropolis was seen as just another stride in London’s giant, unstopping swagger. The rise of a local boy, the son of a Pakistani bus driver, to govern the seat of a former empire was proof of the same unsentimental indifference toward race and religion, good money and bad, and a past that is gone that has enabled London to more or less detach itself from the reality of its circumstances—the capital of a once great nation in decline—and become a universe unto itself. Seven weeks after Khan took office, however, Britain unexpectedly voted to leave the European Union. The decision revealed a chasm in the country and the way it perceives itself. London was on the losing side. By coincidence, a series of calamities followed. Between March and June of this year, London suffered three terrorist attacks and a fire in a high-rise that killed more than eighty people. Sirens filled the streets. The city felt ill-starred and unsure. There was a fractious general election, in which Theresa May’s Conservative Party barely hung on to power, and the slow, grimly momentous process of leaving the E.U. began. I spent time with Khan during London’s recent disastrous months and I asked him if he had thought that running the city would be this hard. “Nothing prepares you for this,” he said. “I didn’t campaign to be the mayor of London and go to funerals.” On a gray, gusty morning in late June, Khan was in the main chamber of City Hall to take questions from the London Assembly, a quasi-legislative body that oversees his activities. Although London has had a form of self-government since the twelfth century, Khan is only its third directly elected mayor. (The first, Ken Livingstone, took office in 2000.) The newness of the role and the somewhat limited nature of its power is embodied in the form of City Hall, a modest, pebble-like structure on the South Bank of the Thames which both of Khan’s predecessors compared to a testicle. From the chamber, a large window looks across the river to the macho-finance architecture of the Square Mile and, a little to the east, the Tower of London, which has stood for martial authority and the city’s protection since the time of the Norman invasion. Khan was a few minutes early for the session. A small man with a beaky nose and silver hair scraped left to right, he wandered to the back of the room and the public gallery there, which was about two-thirds full, to greet parties of students and schoolchildren who had come to watch. “You O.K.?” he asked each group. “Where you from?” On camera and in interviews, Khan is an overprepared A student, cramming neat answers into the available space. In ordinary conversation, he punctures any formality with self-deprecation and a voice that is fast and London-inflected. He drops the “g” from words like “talking” and “walking.” Before he became mayor, Khan used to perform standup comedy, and laughs followed his progress through the gallery. “Are you a troublemaker?” Khan called out to a large woman in African dress who was taking his photograph. She doubled over in embarrassment. When Khan sat down at a desk, his feet did not quite touch the ground.

The first forty minutes of the meeting were taken up by statements from Khan, recounting London’s latest emergencies. The previous Wednesday, June 14th, Khan had been awoken by his staff at 2 A . M . Grenfell Tower, a public-housing block in West London that was home to some three hundred and fifty people, was on fire. Footage shot by firefighters, and later broadcast on the BBC, caught their astonishment as they confronted the scene: “Mate, how the fuck are we going to do that?” The fire rose from the tower’s fourth floor to the twenty-fourth in around fifteen minutes, apparently fed by the building’s cheap, flammable cladding. The temperature inside reached almost two thousand degrees. The final death toll in Grenfell Tower is still not known, but it was the worst fire in London since the Second World War. The magnitude of the disaster was compounded by its political aspect. When I arrived, at around 10 A . M ., the building protruded from the neighborhood like a dead tooth. Flames lapped out of the seventeenth floor. Families in their bedclothes sheltered under trees. “They want us out of the borough,” a girl in her late teens said. “It’s money, money, money.” Kensington and Chelsea, the local authority that owned the tower, is among the richest in the United Kingdom, and within hours the accident, which killed refugees, disabled people, and children, became an indictment of London’s stark inequality and of the austerity policies of May’s unpopular government. Khan, who is a member of the Labour Party, spent part of each of the following five days at Grenfell Tower, meeting firefighters and police, whom he oversees; attending church services; and talking in the street with residents who were distraught and frustrated by the local government’s response. (The leaders of the Kensington and Chelsea council resigned.) The weather was hot, and Khan worked twenty-hour days. Because it was Ramadan, he was also abstaining from food and water until sunset, at around 9:15 P . M . Five nights after the fire, Khan was woken again, this time shortly after midnight, because someone had driven a rental van into a group of Muslim worshippers returning from late-night prayers in Finsbury Park, in North London. One man was killed, and eleven others were injured. The attack was part of a surge in anti-Muslim hate crime after London’s two previous terrorist incidents, which had involved Islamic extremists driving vehicles into crowds. While Khan delivered his statements to the assembly, ten schoolgirls in blue summer dresses and straw hats filed into the gallery. It was painful to watch them listen to the details of each new horror, each fresh social failing in their city. Khan did his best to counter the mood. “I know Londoners will remain strong and united,” he said. “I know we will come through this.” But he sounded exhausted. A great deal of Khan’s power as a politician comes from the hopeful possibilities that he symbolizes. There were times this summer in London when the fact of his election seemed like one of the city’s only graces. “The almost one good thing that people consistently can feel is that they don’t have to believe the worst inevitability on all sides,” Harriet Harman, a former deputy leader of the Labour Party, told me. “Because actually London elected a Muslim mayor, elected Sadiq.” Opponents and skeptics, however, view Khan as an opportunist, vicious at times, who thinks only in terms of his own advancement. “Yeah, it’s a great symbol,” Andrew Boff, a senior Conservative member of the London Assembly, told me, referring to Khan’s election. “I don’t get the sense there is a profound vision.” Khan’s political career before he became mayor was marked as much by shrewd positioning as by meaningful achievement. “He doesn’t like the difficult questions,” Boff said. “It’s as if he is thinking, If I answer this question, it might damage me in the future.” “Can you describe the shark?” Even people sympathetic to Khan often admit that they underestimated him in the past, and have been forced to adjust their view since he became mayor. “Metaphorically—definitely not literally—he seemed to grow several inches,” a former senior Labour official told me. Khan and his advisers, meanwhile, enjoy his image as an underdog, a realist, and a competitor. (Khan is one of seven brothers, all of whom learned to box.) “His politics come from his experience,” a former aide said. “None of it is in that sense ideological or idealistic.” Khan’s visibility as mayor of London, and his sure-footedness, have led to his being frequently talked about as a future Labour leader, and Britain’s first Muslim Prime Minister. “He is absolutely stardust now,” Harman said. “He knows that, and he respects that.” Polls show Khan to be the most popular politician in the country, and the 1.3 million votes cast for him as mayor give him the third-largest mandate of any politician in Europe. But, in 2017, it is still a long road to persuade large, fearful Western populations to trust their way of life and their security to a leader who is a devout Muslim. Britain’s right-wing press and anti-immigrant lobby are ready should Khan stumble. “They will turn on him,” one of his old law clients told me. “They will turn on him.” And then there is wounded London. The capital has always occupied a morbidly distracting role in British life. In the United States, a city equivalent to London would have a population of forty-three million people and an economy the size of Texas’s and California’s combined. For centuries, London has been an unlovable, pushy place, full of questionable characters and strong appetites that have forced the country around it to change, sometimes against its will. In the eighteen-twenties, the rural campaigner William Cobbett described London as “the Great Wen,” a growing boil on the body of the nation. “People would follow, they must follow,” Cobbett mourned, “the million of money.” It is Khan’s lot to have emerged as a national figure just as London is more vulnerable, and more at odds with the rest of Britain, than at any other point in its recent history. Despite the tragedies of the summer, the capital’s fundamental challenge is its future outside the European Union. Brexit poses an existential threat to the city’s wealth and its identity; one in nine Londoners is from elsewhere in the E.U. In City Hall that morning, the final two questions put to Khan were about the impact of the national government’s current hard-line approach to leaving the E.U., which will cost the capital billions and jeopardize its status as a global bazaar. The Mayor was terse and pessimistic. “If you think we will continue to be able to be as prosperous and successful,” he told the assembly, “think again.”

Khan is a student of American politics, and in describing the role of religion in his public identity he often paraphrases John F. Kennedy: he is not a Muslim mayor; he is a mayor who happens to be Muslim. He allays your concerns before they have a chance to form. Khan characterizes himself as a feminist. He is the first mayor to walk in the city’s gay-pride march. But he is also conscious that he has an obligation to talk about and demystify Islam. “There is a way I define myself,” Khan told me, “and there is a way that others have defined me.” He will quote passages from the Quran and the Hadith, the sayings of the Prophet, when discussing terrorism. When I asked him how to say his name (Urdu speakers pronounce it “Saadik”; English speakers tend to say “Sadeek”), Khan spelled out his name in Arabic—“ sawd alif daal kaaf ”—and explained that it means “truthful.” In 2009, when he was sworn in as a member of the Privy Council, an ancient body of senior politicians, Khan brought his own Quran to Buckingham Palace and left it there, because the palace did not have a copy. Sometimes it is as if he were leading a one-man religious-education exercise. “Many people in positions of power and influence, they have not broken bread with a Muslim,” Khan said. “Part of it is reassuring them: The sky is not going to fall in. You are in safe hands. All the stuff that you worry about, I worry about as well. All the dreams you have got, I have got as well.” As mayor, Khan has made some of his religious practices into political acts. During Ramadan, which began this year in late May, Khan often broke his fast—taking the evening meal known as Iftar—at interfaith events. One evening, I joined him for Iftar at the house of the Catholic Archbishop of London, behind Westminster Cathedral. There were about a hundred people in a grand upstairs room decorated with Latin mottoes and a portrait of the Pope. Among them were boys from Ernest Bevin College, a state school in South London, which Khan attended. In 1985, when Khan was fourteen, the school appointed Britain’s first Muslim head teacher, Syed (Naz) Bokhari, who was a mentor to Khan until his death, in 2011. At the Iftar, Khan was introduced by Bokhari’s son, Harris. Because Britain has no senior Muslim authority, Khan often finds himself in the role by default. The other guests of honor at the Iftar were London’s cardinal, Vincent Nichols, and the country’s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis. Khan was in a relaxed mood; he is never quite genial. When he spoke, he told a few safe jokes and quoted the twelfth-century Islamic scholar Ibn al Jawzi: “I have not seen a flaw in people as great as the flaw of the able not reaching their potential.” Khan continued, “As a city, and as a society, improving how we mix together is one of the biggest challenges we face if we want to reach our full potential.” At 9:19 P . M ., Khan broke his fast with a date and a glass of water. There was food ready, but a small group of the most observant Muslims went downstairs to say the Maghrib, the sunset prayer. Khan went, too, and in a ground-floor office lined with Catholic journals and maps of the English coastline the women covered their heads and the men found the direction of Mecca. In the second row of worshippers, his silver head standing out against the black hair of the boys around him, the Mayor of London put his forehead against the floor.

In retirement, Khan’s father, Amanullah, became a muezzin at the Balham Mosque, in Tooting, the scrappy, polyglot South London neighborhood where the Mayor grew up and still lives. (Khan’s wife, Saadiya, is a lawyer; they have two daughters.) Both of Khan’s parents were from middle-class Muslim families who left India during Partition. In Pakistan, Amanullah’s father was a civil servant; Khan’s maternal grandfather managed a cotton mill. Amanullah studied engineering and served in the Pakistani Air Force before emigrating first to Australia and then to London, where he arrived in the early sixties. He calculated that he could earn more as a bus driver than he could starting out at an engineering firm, and he ended up driving a bus for twenty-five years. In 1967, Amanullah’s wife, Sehrun, and their three children came to join him. When Sadiq Aman Khan was born, in 1970, the family lived on the Henry Prince Estate, a housing project in Earlsfield, a mile or so northwest of Tooting. “It wasn’t ‘Oliver Twist,’ ” he told me. “But it was tough.” Soon, there were four more brothers, and the family of ten squeezed into a three-bedroom apartment. (Khan shared a bunk bed until he was twenty-four, the year he got married.) “All eight of us grew up watching my mum and dad working all the hours God sends,” Khan said. “That was the ethic.” Sehrun did piecework sewing—making dresses for fifty pence an item—late into the night. Amanullah died in 2005, and the downward mobility, the toil, of his parents’ immigrant experience is a mark that has never left Khan. He sees his opportunities in the negation of theirs. On a visit to New York last year, the Mets gave Khan a No. 44 jersey, in honor of his father’s bus route. At school, Khan was a good student who imposed himself in disputes that were not his. “He certainly was very forward,” Rodney Dove, one of his sports coaches, said. “He would take up issues that even I would feel, That is nothing to do with you, Sadiq.” Ernest Bevin was a big, teeming place, with white boys from prosperous middle-class families and a growing number of students from newer Afro-Caribbean and South Asian communities. “Children either had to be macho or very charismatic to survive in that atmosphere,” Vernella Fuller, who was Khan’s tutor for five years, said. “And he was very charismatic.” After classes, Khan went to a madrassa, for instruction in Islam. He would cross the road to avoid skinheads in bomber jackets, members of the National Front, a far-right organization that had a strong presence in Tooting and Earlsfield. People shouted “Paki!” at his father on the bus. “There is a very good reason why all my brothers joined the boxing club,” Khan said. “In our area, on our estate, there were certain things you couldn’t say and get away with. So, if somebody called you the P-word, that means there is a fight. That’s it. We’re having a fight. You couldn’t allow that to be tolerated.”

Khan describes his political awakening as a processing of the injustices that he saw in his daily life: his brothers’ friends being stopped and searched by the police; the Wandsworth bus garage, where his father worked, threatened with closure; his teachers on picket lines. Britain in the eighties was experiencing the fullest—and most painful—extent of Margaret Thatcher’s reforms, aimed at liberalizing and deregulating the country’s postwar industrial economy. The Conservatives were in power. Unemployment was high. Public services were chaotic and underfunded. “Something was happening,” Khan told me. “You’d see it on the TV regularly—jobs being lost, the miners’ strike.” No one else in his family was politically active. Khan’s father took the Daily Telegraph , a conservative newspaper. At fifteen, Khan joined the Labour Party; on Saturday mornings, he would hand out leaflets on Tooting High Street. Khan studied law at the North London Polytechnic and then joined Christian Fisher, a small, distinguished firm dedicated to civil-rights work. Louise Christian had campaigned on behalf of the victims of the Marchioness boat crash, in which fifty-one people drowned in the Thames, in 1989, and Michael Fisher frequently represented suspected I.R.A. members. Khan worked on discrimination cases, often involving employment issues and police misconduct. In 1996, when he was twenty-five, Khan won what was then a record payout of two hundred and twenty thousand pounds from the Metropolitan Police for the wrongful arrest and assault of a Chinese hairdresser. The following year, he was made partner. In the late nineties, Khan began to represent black and Asian police officers, who were themselves suffering discrimination—often in the form of trumped-up corruption investigations. He wore stubble, to make himself look older, and his clients took an almost paternal pride in their bullish young advocate. “I could have gone to hundreds of solicitors,” Ali Dizaei told me. Dizaei is a former commander in the Metropolitan Police, originally from Iran, who was acquitted in 2003 after the most expensive investigation of a single officer in the history of Scotland Yard. “He believed, you know. And that makes a lot of difference to a person of color who wants to take on an organization.” Khan’s colleagues were taken aback by his drive and his capacity for work. “It mystified all of us,” Matthew Ryder, a barrister who worked regularly with Khan, told me. “It was endless, endless. The guy didn’t sleep.” It was the early days of e-mail, and Khan’s clients would hear his computer pinging constantly in the background in his messy office, near the British Museum. When another young lawyer at Christian Fisher, Matt Foot, became a father, Khan advised him to buy a BabyBjörn carrier, so that he could keep his hands free for work. There was something else about Khan that made him stand out. In the eighties and nineties, many of the leading civil-rights lawyers in London came from radical left-wing backgrounds. Foot was from a family of campaigning journalists and politicians, and Christian, who hired Khan, was a candidate for the Socialist Alliance Party in the 2001 general election. Khan never shared their ideological bent. “There is a slight duality about Sadiq,” Foot said, choosing his words carefully. “I think his strong Labour working-class roots are a big part of what he is. I think he has also been very efficient.” Khan’s politics were more results-driven than many of his colleagues’ were. With Ryder, who is half Jamaican and also had a humble London upbringing, Khan was one of the few nonwhite lawyers in his field. In court, the men were sometimes mistaken for their clients. “You are trying to do stuff for people who are your friends, your neighbors, your community,” Khan told me. “That is the law I chose to do.” Ryder, who now works for Khan at City Hall, explained that their backgrounds helped them to see their cases in functional rather than abstract terms. “It was political in terms of vindicating rights,” Ryder said. “It wasn’t political in terms of having a larger agenda.” Khan cut a similarly pragmatic figure in local politics. In 1994, he became a councillor in Tooting. Tooting is part of the borough of Wandsworth (London has thirty-three boroughs, each with its own elected council), which was heavily dominated by the Conservatives. Nationally, however, Labour was on the brink of power. After almost two decades in opposition, the Party had rebranded itself under Tony Blair, enthusiastically embracing the free market, tough policies on crime, and the reform of Britain’s public services. Like most newly elected candidates, Khan was part of the modernizing wing of the Party. “He was a complete Blairite,” Tony Belton, who led the Labour opposition group in Wandsworth, told me. On the council, Khan was a controlled, lawyerly presence. “He doesn’t emote much about his politics,” Belton said. “I don’t think too many people would warm to him, exactly.” Khan doesn’t drink, so he didn’t spend time in the pub with the other councillors. He would come to meetings, and then go. When we spoke, Belton did not find it easy to square his memory of the reserved young councillor with the mayor that he sees now. “It seems to me . . . ,” he said, and hesitated. “It seems to me he must have much more of a strategic grasp than I worked out.”

On April 1, 2002, a young Islamist from Essex named Maajid Nawaz was arrested in a rental apartment in Alexandria, on the northern coast of Egypt. Nawaz, a twenty-two-year-old student, was a member of Hizb ut-Tahrir, a political organization that campaigns for a global caliphate. Hizb ut-Tahrir was allowed to operate in the U.K. but was forbidden under Egyptian law. Nawaz had flown into the country on September 10, 2001, joining several other activists. Now, in the early months of the American war on terror, the government of Hosni Mubarak was rounding up suspected extremists. Nawaz was captured and driven across the desert to Cairo, where he was held in the Tora prison. In England, his family and friends tried to find him a lawyer. At the time, an even more radical offshoot of Hizb ut-Tahrir, called Al-Muhajiroun, was operating; it was later banned in the U.K. A pro-bono legal adviser to members of Al-Muhajiroun, Makbool Javaid, was married to Sadiq Khan’s sister, Farhat. (Javaid and Farhat later divorced.) “Word spread through the grapevine,” Nawaz told me of Khan. “They must have heard that he takes on cases such as these.” Khan flew to Cairo a few months later to meet Nawaz in prison. After 9/11, Britain under Blair had become an active partner in U.S.-led efforts to monitor and break up Islamist movements around the world, and Nawaz was struck by Khan’s intensity. “He was stirred up and riled up,” Nawaz said. “He prays, he fasts. So it could have been him next. There was more to it than just ‘I care about human rights.’ It’s ‘This is my family. This is my community.’ ” Khan went back to Egypt for the trial, but to no avail: Nawaz was convicted of belonging to an unlicensed organization and sentenced to five years in prison. The war on terror created work for civil-rights firms in London, and especially for their Muslim lawyers. London has one of the most diverse Islamic communities on earth. During the second half of the twentieth century, refugees, exiles, and radicals from across the Muslim world ended up living on quiet Victorian streets in Wood Green, Tottenham, and Walthamstow. Khan was in demand. By the early aughts, he was the chair of the legal-affairs committee for the Muslim Council of Britain, the largest representative body in the country. One of his clients, Feroz Abbasi, was imprisoned at Guantánamo Bay. In 2003, counterterrorism police arrested Babar Ahmad, a childhood acquaintance of Khan’s, in Tooting. Khan was the first person to come to the house after the raid, Ahmad told me, “as a councillor, as a lawyer, and a community figure.” Ahmad had fought in the Bosnian war, and was accused of raising money online for the Taliban. He was released after a week. But nine months later, in August, 2004, he was detained again, under the U.K.’s new fast-track extradition treaty with the U.S., and his case became the subject of a national campaign against the agreement. Days after Ahmad’s second arrest, there was a meeting in Tooting, where Khan was the main speaker. “ ‘I know Babar, we play football together,’ ” Saghir Hussain, another civil-rights lawyer, recalled him saying. “ ‘He is not as good as me, but we are going to fight these cases.’ ” Khan was also running for Parliament. Tooting was a safe Labour seat, and in early 2004 Khan was among more than a hundred candidates to replace the outgoing M.P., Tom Cox, in the next election. His main rival, Stuart King, another young Blairite councillor, had trade-union support and more local endorsements. King also thought he had more free time to campaign: Khan had a young family and a hectic law practice. “Where is he going to find the time to do it?” King asked. But Khan made a list of every Labour member in the constituency that would select the candidate—around seven hundred people—and spoke to them individually. “We were tracking: Who have I spoken to? Who do I have to go back to? Who do I need to firm up?” an aide who worked on the campaign told me. “He was just out all the time.” Khan won the selection easily. He left the law, and in May, 2005, he was one of three hundred and fifty-five Labour M.P.s elected in Tony Blair’s third victory as Prime Minister. Four were Muslim. The war in Iraq was desperately unpopular in Britain’s Islamic communities; there had also been major riots in the North of England in the summer of 2001, in towns deeply divided between their white and Asian populations. The government was anxious to find liberal, mainstream Muslims who could speak up for its positions. “We needed someone who could feature on the BBC,” Mike O’Brien, a Foreign Office minister, told me. O’Brien suggested to Khan that he might focus on issues affecting British Muslims when he arrived in Westminster, but Khan balked. “He said, ‘No. That is not how I want to be seen,’ ” O’Brien recalled. “I just wanted to be a mainstream M.P.,” Khan told me.

Nine weeks after Khan entered the House of Commons, four British Muslims blew themselves up in subways and on a bus during rush hour in London, killing fifty-two people and injuring seven hundred others. The attacks, on July 7, 2005, remain the country’s worst terrorist incident, and raised traumatic questions about how ostensibly well-integrated young Muslim men—the leader of the bombers, Mohammad Sidique Khan, worked in a primary school—could become suicide bombers. “They were Sadiqs,” one Labour peer told me. “On the seventh of July, things changed,” Khan said. He watched as academics, the government, and Muslim community leaders struggled to analyze what had happened. “You can’t vacate the field when you are a member of that faith, and you think in a non-arrogant way you know more than them,” he said. Khan went to see Harman, who had also been a civil-rights lawyer and was now a senior figure in the Party. Harman had been one of a handful of female Labour M.P.s when she was first elected, in 1982, and she told Khan that initially she hadn’t wanted to work on women’s issues. “ ‘You have got no choice,’ ” Khan remembered her saying. “ ‘Because, if you don’t, who will? And the others that will aren’t as good as you.’ ” In Parliament, Khan maintained an independent streak. In November, 2005, he voted against Draconian antiterrorism legislation, helping to bring about Blair’s first defeat in the House of Commons as Prime Minister. But Khan was also prepared to be a team player. He met with Blair and took part in Home Office initiatives aimed at engaging with British Muslims after the July 7th attacks. Some of Khan’s former colleagues watched these gestures with dismay. Matt Foot caught a glimpse of Khan on the news, lining up with other Muslim activists to shake Blair’s hand at a Labour Party Conference. “I remember shouting at the telly,” Foot said. “What a disgrace.” Saghir Hussain, who had worked with Khan on the Babar Ahmad campaign, sensed that now he wasn’t pushing the issue hard enough in Westminster. When Nawaz was released from prison, he heard that Khan could no longer be trusted. His departure from Christian Khan, as the firm had become, had been acrimonious, and ended with a dispute over money. “I remember Louise Christian saying, ‘We think he has sold out,’ ” Nawaz recalled. (Christian declined to be interviewed for this article.) In early 2007, Khan became a parliamentary aide to Jack Straw, who, as Foreign Secretary, had overseen the invasion of Iraq. The following year, Khan helped push through the House of Commons antiterrorism legislation that would have enabled police to detain suspects for up to six weeks without charging them. (The provision was ultimately defeated in the House of Lords.) For many civil-rights campaigners, Khan’s work on the bill was proof that his personal ambition had overcome any previous scruples. “That is a shocking thing. It really is,” Foot said. “I think he gets a pass from a lot of white people, the well-intentioned ones,” Hussain said. “They want diversity, do you know what I mean? So he can play them, but he can’t play people who know him, and know him well.” As a junior M.P., Khan acquired a reputation as a skilled and discreet go-between in the House of Commons. “He is in essence a moderate, sensible guy,” O’Brien said. But he had to contend with the same prejudices that affected other British Muslims. In February, 2008, a former police officer admitted to the Sunday Times that Khan had been secretly recorded on visits to see Babar Ahmad in prison in 2005 and 2006. Although visitors to terrorism suspects were routinely bugged by the security services, since the sixties a convention known as the Wilson Doctrine had forbidden eavesdropping on M.P. s. An inquiry laid the blame for the surveillance on an administrative oversight, but many believed that Khan was a victim of racial profiling. “I am absolutely certain that the fact that he had a Pakistani name meant that they made immediate assumptions,” Straw said. Ahmad, who eventually served two years in solitary confinement in a supermax prison in Connecticut, found the episode almost comic. “Look at this guy,” he told me. “He has been a Labour Party member all his life. He has been a councillor. He is an M.P. But that is not enough to take the finger of suspicion away. It was funny. People were, like, Poor Sadiq—after all this time, it hasn’t got him anywhere.” But Khan wasn’t always a victim. After Nawaz was released from prison in Egypt, he renounced political Islam and returned to the U.K. to set up a counter-extremism think tank called Quilliam. During an interview with Iranian TV, in 2009, Khan, who was by then a junior minister, referred to the group and other moderate Muslims as “Uncle Toms,” a phrase that he later said he regretted using. Part of Khan’s skill as a politician is having the right idiom for whomever he is speaking to at any given moment. Nawaz, who is now a radio talk-show host in London, observed that Khan has never apologized to him personally, despite the many times they have spoken. “It’s inescapable that Saadik-known-as-Sadeek has used his Muslim identity to advance his political career,” he told me. “Back then, he was clever enough to know where to get the clients from. Now he is clever enough to know where to get the votes from.” In 2010, Khan was in danger of losing his seat in Parliament. After thirteen years in power, Labour was in retreat across the country. O’Brien recalled seeing Khan at a drinks party in Downing Street, where he talked about returning to practice law. In the general election, the Conservatives targeted Khan with a high-profile campaign in Tooting. The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, put up an antiwar South Asian candidate named Nasser Butt, who had the potential to split the Labour vote in the constituency. “I became an immediate threat to Sadiq’s Muslim-vote bank,” Butt told me. However, Butt belonged to an Islamic sect, the Ahmadiyya, that holds theological beliefs different from those of mainstream Sunni Islam, the predominant branch in the U.K. During the campaign, Liberal Democrat posters were torn down and Butt suffered anti-Ahmadi abuse. At an election event at the Tooting Islamic Centre, the Conservative candidate, Mark Clarke, who is mixed race, had to be locked in a room for his own protection, after being mistaken for Butt; Butt was advised to stay away altogether. Although he blamed activists from the center, which is attached to the Balham Mosque, for the discrimination during the election, Butt was convinced that Khan was also involved. “He was part of it,” he said. “I was quite sure he was directing it.” Khan has always denied any wrongdoing. But on May 3, 2010, two days before the election, Butt sent his son to secretly record a meeting at the Islamic center. Butt gave me a copy of the recording. On it, a speaker identified as Harris Bokhari, the son of Khan’s old head teacher and mentor, addresses the room. “The majority of Muslims in this area are voting Lib Dem, because they think Nasser Butt is a Muslim,” Bokhari says. “You need to go into the community and take these posters down.” One man at the meeting asks Bokhari how to fill in his ballot papers. “All you need to do is just look for Sadiq Khan, Labour Party, and just tick it,” he says. “Whatever else you vote is up to you.” Bokhari told me that he does not remember the meeting. Khan held his seat by less than three thousand votes.

People seeking to explain Khan’s rise often talk about his gift for knowing what the mood is. “Is ‘chameleon’ the right word? Maybe. No, he is more of a submarine,” a former senior official in Gordon Brown’s government, which succeeded Blair’s, in 2007, said. “He sort of rose without trace.” Khan was the campaign manager for Ed Miliband, the less fancied of two brothers who contested the Labour leadership after the Party’s defeat in 2010. Khan’s candidate won, and he became the Shadow Justice Secretary, tracking and opposing government changes to the legal system, but he wasn’t considered a future star. He rambled in media interviews, and was marginalized by other, more polished members of Miliband’s team. In 2013, Khan became the Party’s Shadow Minister for London—a natural vehicle for a mayoral bid—but he wasn’t widely seen as an obvious contender for the office. “I always found him perfectly nice,” a former Party official said. “I just never had a particularly high opinion of him.” In May, 2015, Labour lost a second consecutive general election, allowing David Cameron and the Conservatives to form their first majority government in eighteen years. Khan’s mayoral campaign started out three days later, in two rooms rented from a polling company on the Commercial Road, a noisy, scruffy thoroughfare in East London. The conventional wisdom was that Miliband had moved Labour too far to the left; the immediate front-runner to be the Party’s mayoral candidate was Tessa Jowell, a centrist former minister under Blair who had helped bring the Olympics to the city in 2012. Khan, by contrast, seemed unsure how to define himself. The first draft of his campaign message was downbeat. “It was a bit misery: I share your pain; we can make things better,” Polly Billington, a former Miliband adviser who worked for Khan that summer, told me. Billington tried out the message on a group of campaign volunteers, some as young as seventeen. “We got them in a room and said, ‘This is what we are doing at the moment—what do you think of it?’ ” she recalled. “They were, like, That’s not the London I recognize. I love living in London. It’s hard. It needs to be better, but it is bloody brilliant.” Khan’s team began to build a feel-good campaign, highlighting lower mass-transit fares and a major new house-building program, with his uplifting biography at the center. “People actually thought his story about London—him saying his story was the story of London—would alienate the affluent,” Billington said. “But we said, No, no. They want to believe it’s true. It’s like the American Dream.” The mayoral primary campaign ran in parallel with the next contest for the Labour leadership. In June, Khan was one of thirty-six M.P.s who nominated Jeremy Corbyn , a socialist outsider whose rallies unexpectedly caught the imagination of the Party’s membership. Khan has always insisted that he backed Corbyn merely to insure that there was a range of candidates, but he benefitted from the surge of energy on the left. “There was only one reason he nominated Corbyn, and that was to sweep up the Corbyn supporters,” the former Downing Street official said. Khan campaigned for mayor in all thirty-three boroughs and spoke at more than two hundred events. Criticism from his former colleagues didn’t damage him at all. He won the final round of voting by nearly twenty per cent. Eight days later, he distanced himself from Corbyn, who had become Labour’s new leader, in an interview with the right-wing Daily Mail . “I will be my own man,” Khan said. The Conservative Party’s choice for mayor was Zac Goldsmith, an M.P. from Richmond. As a whole, the capital tends to vote Labour. In 2015, the Party held forty-five of London’s seventy-three parliamentary seats. But, between 2008 and 2016, the mayor was Boris Johnson, a popular, seemingly shambolic figure, who showed that the Tories were capable of winning City Hall. In his own way, Goldsmith also appeared able to reach across the city’s traditional divides. The son of a billionaire, he was tall, good-looking, and a committed environmentalist. On the campaign trail, though, he was diffident and underpowered—except when the subject was Khan. Over and over, Goldsmith depicted his opponent as a radical (the word “Muslim” was elided) with potentially extremist views. “I am up against somebody who poses a real danger to London,” Goldsmith told the Guardian last March. “I’m absolutely convinced of it.” “This is nothing like the photo on Airbnb.” Conservatives in the London Assembly sensed the miscalculation immediately. “It was a shit campaign,” Andrew Boff said. Goldsmith plowed on. In the spring of 2016, the Tories sent letters intended for various ethnic minorities in London who might be disturbed by the prospect of a Muslim mayor. “Sadiq Khan Will Put London’s Future And Your Community At Risk,” read one letter, aimed at the city’s Tamils, warning of taxes on “your family’s heirlooms.” Senior Tories, including May, who was then the Home Secretary, and Cameron, the Prime Minister, declared that London would be unsafe under Khan. Right-wing newspapers trawled through his former clients and looked for past instances when he had shared platforms with Islamists. A video surfaced of Javaid, his ex-brother-in-law, giving an anti-Western speech. Two weeks before the election, speaking in the House of Commons, Cameron accused Suliman Gani, Khan’s former imam in Tooting, of supporting the Islamic State. Labour M.P.s shouted “Racist!” in reply. “I think they are shouting down this point because they don’t want to hear the truth,” Cameron responded. In public, Khan made light of the tactics. “Hey @ZacGoldsmith,” he tweeted. “There’s no need to keep pointing at me & shouting ‘he’s a Muslim.’ I put it on my own leaflets.” Two weeks before the election, Khan had a sixteen-point lead in the polls. Cameron was forced to apologize to Gani after it turned out that he had never backed the Islamic State, and had fallen out with Khan over Khan’s support for same-sex marriage. A few Tories broke ranks. “If @SadiqKhan isn’t an acceptable enough Muslim 2 stand for London mayor, which Muslim is?” Sayeeda Warsi, a former chairman of the Conservative Party, tweeted. Khan’s team found the viciousness of the Goldsmith campaign unsettling. “I don’t think they realized quite how dangerous a game they were playing,” a senior Khan aide told me. Last June, Jo Cox, a Labour M.P., was murdered by a right-wing extremist during Britain’s E.U. referendum campaign. Khan’s social-media feeds are jammed with alt-right Pepe frogs and Islamophobic junk. “Sadiq is probably the most blasé about his security,” the aide said. “We are all much more stressed about it.” On May 6th last year, Khan was elected mayor of London with fifty-seven per cent of the vote. At the count, the candidate from Britain First, a far-right party, turned his back. “I want to say thank you,” Khan said, “to every single Londoner for making the impossible possible.”

Khan’s office at City Hall is on the eighth floor. A large black-and-white photograph of Muhammad Ali hangs in the corner. At around 7 A . M . on June 24th last year, just as it was clear that Britain had voted to leave the European Union, the Mayor was on the phone, making his way through a list of calls to the Bank of England and to the heads of the biggest businesses in the capital. “We were grief-stricken,” he told me. “It was like we were in mourning.” Brexit made plain divided ways of thinking in British society—between young and old, educated and less well educated, urban and rural—that the country’s traditional party politics had previously been able to disguise. Along with Scotland and Northern Ireland, London—whose population dwarfs both of those—was the only region in the U.K. that chose decisively to stay in the E.U. In Central London, where the nation’s political, financial, and cultural power is held, the results were overwhelming. Seventy-five per cent of voters in Wandsworth, where Khan lives, chose to remain. For many Londoners, waking up on the wrong side of an almighty national decision was a vertiginous, disorienting feeling. Cameron, who had called the referendum, resigned. “I remember just thinking, Oh, my God,” one of Khan’s senior advisers said. “What have we done?” There will be places in Britain, and aspects of its way of life, that will be entirely unaffected by Brexit. There will be specific situations where things improve. But London will not be one of them. Most people date the city’s current flourishing—the money, the food, the art, the good-looking people, the tourists astonished at the cost of public transport, the tech dreamers, the Russians digging out basement saunas, the coffee—more or less to 1986, and a wave of Thatcherite financial deregulation known as the Big Bang. London had begun to recover from the Second World War in the sixties, but the Big Bang allowed the city to resume its historic role as a global marketplace and the maker of time zones. It also positioned London as the undisputed financial capital of the E.U. As the Single Market, the E.U.’s economic structure, integrated in the nineties, with so-called “passporting rights,” which allowed businesses and banks to trade freely across the Continent, the city sucked people and law firms and entrepreneurs from Lisbon and Paris and Berlin. Between 2005 and 2015, the number of E.U. citizens in London doubled, to almost a million. The city grew faster than at any time in the previous century. Brexit won’t undo all of this, but withdrawing from the E.U.—withdrawing from anything—is antithetical to London’s accretion of people and capital during the past thirty years. “We are a hub leaving a network,” Alex Barker, the Brussels chief of the Financial Times , told me. “That is a big bloody problem.” Estimates suggest that, if the U.K. leaves the Single Market, London’s financial sector alone will lose around twenty billion pounds a year and shed between thirty thousand and seventy thousand jobs. But, until the terms are final, Brexit exists more as an unravelling, a kind of die-off, of London’s precious thickness. Pieces of the ecosystem that you didn’t know were there—the city’s eight-hundred-billion-pound-a-day euro clearing market—are unlikely to survive in their present form. In late May, migration statistics showed that E.U. citizens are already leaving the country, undermining London’s economy, and, in particular, its construction, health-care, and tourism sectors. “The hemorrhage has begun, the flight has begun,” Sean McKee, the policy director of the London chamber of commerce, told me. The disparity between the capital’s needs and those of the rest of the country has fostered a strain of London nationalism. It has also put pressure on Khan to be an advocate for the city and to champion its cosmopolitan outlook. The morning after the referendum, City Hall started using the hashtag #LondonIsOpen, a catchall slogan that seemed to defy the result. At the same time, Khan’s immigrant background, centrist policies, and close identification with the city have allowed people to believe that he may emerge as a Macron-like savior in the post-Brexit landscape. One morning this spring, I went to watch as Khan presided over an annual citizenship ceremony at City Hall. A pink #LondonIsOpen flag flew next to the Thames, alongside the Union Jack and an E.U. standard. Under his mayoralty, the event had a new edge. Khan’s face broke into a smile as the new citizens, one from each borough, swore their oath of allegiance to the Queen in a mixed chorus of accents. Afterward, I spoke to Stanislava Saffova, a Slovakian trainee psychotherapist, who had decided to apply for British citizenship on the morning of the Brexit vote. Saffova, who was wearing a floor-length white gown, had been living in London for eleven years. “That was a bit like, Oh, my God, I am not welcome anymore,” she said. She watched Khan moving among the new Britons. “It is a very encouraging story that he has to tell,” Saffova said. “Especially for people like us.” “I should have known—I hate the beach.” But some London politicians and pro-business lobbyists are frustrated that Khan hasn’t done more to agitate on behalf of the capital. In part, he has been hemmed in by the policies of the national Labour Party: outside London, the Party’s traditional white working-class base voted heavily to leave the E.U., and Corbyn, a longtime Euroskeptic, has been a meek opponent of May’s severe interpretation of the result. But London has its own heft. The capital contributes thirty per cent of the nation’s tax revenue, as much as the next thirty-seven cities combined. And yet Khan, unlike Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of Scotland’s devolved government (which contributes around eight per cent of the U.K.’s tax), has not managed to secure a formal say in the negotiations and the final Brexit deal. “With a mandate his size, he can bang the table,” McKee said. Last November, at City Hall, the chamber of commerce and a range of business groups launched a proposal for a new “London visa,” along with reforms to the U.K.’s immigration system, to protect the capital’s economy. Khan did not attend. “There are moments when you clear your diary and you actually say, I am getting behind this stuff,” McKee said. “We need our mayor.” When I asked Khan about his apparent reticence, he stressed that London should not further separate itself from the rest of the U.K. “I have got to be pragmatic and work with a Tory government,” he said. “That may not please those who want me to posture and pose.” But the other explanation is that Khan wants to be Prime Minister one day, at which point he will have to win over a national following that is inherently more skeptical toward his faith and the kind of society that he represents. “If he becomes ‘Remainer-in-Chief,’ that is a big problem when he wants England to vote for him,” the former Downing Street adviser said. Khan knows all this. He is a deliberate character, who studies the angles. “You can hear the argument going on in his office and in his own head,” another former Party official told me.

On April 18th, May called a snap general election, surprising the country. Her stated reason for the vote, which would take place seven weeks later, was to gain a strong mandate for the upcoming Brexit talks, which were due to start in June. But she also had an irresistible target: Corbyn’s Labour Party was weak and drifting. May, who succeeded Cameron last July, had an untroubled first nine months in office, and she had the opportunity to win a landslide majority in the House of Commons. Ten days after her announcement, the Conservatives had a nineteen-point lead in the polls. Calling an early election also had the happy consequence of complicating Khan’s timetable for a return to national politics. If he serves two terms as mayor, the earliest that he could now theoretically become Prime Minister is 2027. Once the campaign began, however, May turned out to be awkward and aloof. The Conservative Party manifesto seemed to take its voters, particularly the elderly, for granted. On May 22nd, with the election less than three weeks away, a suicide bomber blew himself up in the foyer of an arena in Manchester where Ariana Grande was giving a concert, killing twenty-two people and injuring dozens of others, many of them young girls. The attack, which was the worst in the U.K. since the 2005 bombings, unnerved the country, and focussed attention on Britain’s strained public services—its police and hospitals—which have had their funding squeezed by Tory-led governments for the past seven years. Corbyn, by contrast, announced a series of popular policies, such as the cancellation of student debt. Khan campaigned almost solely in the capital, where he is Labour’s most popular asset. “I think you will find a lot of Labour candidates in London, the person they wanted on their leaflets was not Jeremy Corbyn but Sadiq,” an M.P. in the city told me. On the Saturday before the election, Khan was addressing volunteers for Dr. Rosena Allin-Khan, his successor as Tooting’s M.P., before heading to the east of the city to stump for candidates in Dagenham and Ilford. In Tooting, Khan stood on a small table plastered with red-and-yellow placards to fire up a crowd of about a hundred Labour activists penned into the narrow courtyard of a local business center. “For those at the back, I am standing on a table,” Khan said. Big laugh. Khan is aware of what his supporters see in him, and of both the immediate and the international contexts of his mayoralty. Khan first clashed with Donald Trump last May, after Trump, as a candidate, proposed a ban on Muslims entering the United States. In Tooting, Khan goaded the activists with memories of the populist victories of 2016. “You need to remind yourself how you felt when you stayed up during the night to watch the results of the Brexit vote. I want you to remember how you felt when you watched the American elections in November,” Khan said. “We don’t want to feel that way.” Whenever he can, Khan travels by public transport. That day, he was accompanied by a single aide. He walked back toward the Tooting Broadway tube station, stopping every minute or so to shake hands, or to pose for a selfie. “Let’s do it!” he said each time, as enthusiastic as the last. A woman with a yoga mat said she wasn’t sure about Corbyn. “He’s not standing here,” Khan shot back. An elderly woman pushing a shopping cart raised a hand in greeting. “How is Father?” Khan called out. “Say hello to him from me, O.K.?” As we passed a brunch place on the other side of the road, Khan hollered to the waiting queue, “Have the sourdough and avocado!” At the station, he checked that this article would appear after the election and predicted that May would win. That night, after breaking his fast, Khan was watching television with his wife when one of his aides texted. Just after 10 P . M ., three men in a white van had driven across London Bridge, not far from City Hall, and mounted the sidewalk at around fifty miles an hour, attempting to run down as many people as possible. The atrocity replicated the tactics of the attack on Westminster Bridge, in March, in which four people died. But this time, when the van crashed, the men emerged armed with long knives, and slashed at people drinking in Borough Market, a popular hive of bars, pubs, and restaurants. Eight people were killed in eight minutes before armed police arrived and shot the men. London went on high alert for what the British security services call an M.T.F.A.—a marauding-terrorist firearms attack—of the type carried out in Paris in November, 2015. Khan worked the phone from home. He once described to me the standard thoughts of Western Muslims upon hearing about a terrorist attack. “First thing is, Please let nobody have died,” he said. “Secondly, you think about the families, and you think, Oh, God. And then, thirdly or fourthly, you are thinking, Oh, please, God, let the person responsible not claim to be doing this in the name of Islam, because the fifth or sixth process is having to explain that this has nothing to do with your faith.” I reached the emergency cordon at Borough Market at around noon the following day. The tide was high, and a black, high-powered police boat gunned around on the river. The market is a recognizable artifact of twenty-first-century cosmopolitan London. It is where I remember first trying chorizo. In a small cul-de-sac of houses, a few hundred yards from where the attackers were killed, a middle-aged Muslim woman stood next to her plants. “One woman was stabbed fifteen times,” she said. “Can you imagine, a knife going through you fifteen times?” Her neighbor, a young Dutch economist named David Verdam, had been hosting a party the night before. As the crowds ran away from the market, he opened his door, and some Polish tourists took refuge. Of the eight people who died, seven were born outside the U.K. Verdam talked about the Brexit vote and the rising hostility toward immigrants, and worried about the possible impact on the election, which was four days away. In the way that it did in London this summer, it seemed hard to separate the violence from politics, and a sense of things coming apart. “The bagels—they just keep getting bigger, no?” Khan spent the morning with the emergency services and giving interviews. In a statement, he advised Londoners that there would be more police on the streets and urged them not to be alarmed by their presence. At noon, he was trolled by Trump. “At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ‘no reason to be alarmed!’ ” the President tweeted. Khan hadn’t slept. He was still mid-crisis. “The basic rule amongst politicians and amongst leaders is a sense of solidarity—it is almost like our version of NATO Article 5,” he told me. “So I was extremely surprised when the President of the U.S.A., our strongest ally, said what he said. It was disappointing, to be honest.” When a spokesperson for Khan said that Trump had taken the Mayor’s words out of context, the President tweeted again, calling it a “pathetic excuse.” I asked Khan if he knew why he had got under Trump’s skin. “The short answer is I don’t know, but I can understand if we were both aged twelve years old,” he said. At City Hall, there was only one flag, the Union Jack, at half-mast. From Tower Bridge, I looked back upriver. The city shivered with its usual slower Sunday rhythm: the river, the sky, a thousand moving parts. Except on London Bridge, where six red buses stood in a line, with the rest of the traffic stopped around them, frozen from the night before, like a stuck section of film."

Now he has aimed for shallow waters. Most of “Dunkirk” is set on and off the beaches of northern France, close to the Belgian border—a perilous place to be, in late May and early June of 1940. The British Expeditionary Force, dispatched to France in the fall of the previous year, had been forced into an inglorious retreat. The result was that a multitude of Allied troops were stranded in and around the town of Dunkirk, waiting at the sea’s edge to be rescued. For prowling German aircraft, they were easy prey. Thankfully, salvation did arrive, in the shape not just of the Royal Navy but also of a flotilla of small vessels—the Little Ships, as they came to be known, some seven hundred strong—that had been summoned to the fray. Eventually, in what Churchill called “a miracle of deliverance,” more than three hundred thousand men made it back to England.

This saga is an unlikely candidate for a major Hollywood production, especially one written and directed by the maker of the “Dark Knight” trilogy. It’s hard to think of a more parochial tale. Dunkirk is stitched into the British mythology of the Second World War and, even now, occasional mention is made of “the Dunkirk spirit,” yet the legend has never travelled far, and for obvious reasons. Operation Dynamo—the code name for the evacuation—was not a victory but a barely averted catastrophe, and it came on the heels of what Churchill himself, in the House of Commons, lamented as “a colossal military disaster” in Belgium and France. Many countries, preferring straightforward triumphs, would have swept such an episode under the rug with a mixture of embarrassment and relief. Something about Dunkirk, though, appeals to the peculiar British love of the gallantly narrow squeak, and, in the deployment of the Little Ships, to an abiding fondness for the doughty and the makeshift. You can understand Nolan’s interest; born in London, in 1970, he belongs to what is probably the last generation to have been reared on the rousing fable of Dunkirk. Why on earth, however, should he want to spread the word?

A clue to this puzzle comes early in the film. Up onscreen appear the phrases “1. The Mole,” “2. The Sea,” and “3. The Air.” They introduce us to the three narrative strands that will wind through the next hundred minutes or so; notice the hint of the elemental. The Mole refers to a concrete jetty jutting into Dunkirk Harbor, whereas the air is the domain of a Spitfire pilot (Tom Hardy). When we first encounter him, he is already aloft, in a formation of three. Never do we discover which squadron he belongs to, or what sort of life he has left behind on the ground. For the most part, all that we see of him is his goggled eyes; not until the finale are we shown the rest of him, and only in the ensuing credits do we find out that he is called Farrier. It must have taken Hardy almost an entire morning to learn his lines, which seem even sparser than his dialogue for “Mad Max: Fury Road” (2015), although, as we know from that masterwork, the less we hear from him the tighter our grasp of his character, and the greater the powers that seem to be held in check. At one point in “Dunkirk,” Farrier, low on fuel, is faced with a choice: pursue a German bomber that is harrying a warship crammed with evacuees, or turn tail and head for home before the tank runs dry? He says nothing, but those eyes reveal all. We follow his thoughts as clearly as we do every tip and tilt of his wings.

No such clarity below. Men are lined up on the shore, hoping to get onto one of the ships that dock in the harbor, but a sullen quiet prevails; the next bomb could shred and scatter them, and they cannot predict where it will hit. Shouldering through the crowd are a couple of young British soldiers with a stretcher, who are trying to get one of the wounded on board—and maybe, in the process, sneak a berth themselves. Gradually, one of them, Tommy (Fionn Whitehead), gains a foothold in the drama, though you couldn’t call him the hero, for there is no main character in “Dunkirk.” Instead, various figures move onstage and off: Commander Bolton (Kenneth Branagh), who oversees the embarkation; Alex (Harry Styles), a fellow-evacuee whom Tommy meets halfway through; and a numb and nameless man (Cillian Murphy) found shuddering on a capsized hull. Silent at first, he eventually mutters, “U-boat.”

Meanwhile, out in the English Channel, and heading to Dunkirk, is the Moonstone, skippered by Dawson (Mark Rylance), her owner. (In truth, the majority of Little Ships were requisitioned for the voyage across, but there were exceptions, and that is why Dawson casts off just before the uniformed authorities can reach him.) He recognizes a Spitfire from its growling thrum overhead, without having to glance up. “Rolls-Royce Merlin engine,” he says. “Sweetest sound you could hear out here.” He is no more voluble than the rest of the folk in this film, who seem either stunned by events or taut with determination, but Rylance, as ever, conveys a vigor of spirit through the simple crispness of his gestures. He removes his jacket on departure, and, throughout the ordeal, wears a white shirt, a tie, and a sweater, as if he were doing a bit of Sunday gardening rather than hauling a shoal of his countrymen, half-drowned and drenched in oil, from the unfriendly waves."
453,http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/middlemarch-gets-winningly-adapted-as-a-web-series,newyorker,“Middlemarch” Gets Winningly Adapted as a Web Series,[],"“Middlemarch,” by George Eliot, has largely been immune to the kind of contemporary adaptation visited upon the works of other nineteenth-century writers. The novelist Kay Woodward has turned Charlotte Brontë’s “Jane Eyre” into a chapter book for tweens called “Jane Airhead,” and Jane Austen’s works have been endlessly updated, from “Bridget Jones’s Diary” to “The Lizzie Bennet Diaries,” a Web series that won an Emmy, four years ago, for translating Austen’s novel into the form of a vlog.

But why never “ Middlemarch ”? Why has the novel proved largely resistant to such reimagining? There is, to be sure, a history of accomplished novelists slipping references to Eliot’s masterwork into their own fictions, using a character’s relation to the novel as an indicator of his or her moral development, while also offering a sly allusion to the literary company that the novelist in question wishes to keep. In Edith Wharton’s “The Age of Innocence,” Newland Archer receives a box of books sent from England, including “a novel called ‘Middlemarch,’ as to which there had lately been interesting things said in the reviews.” (He tries to read it but finds himself distracted from the story of English provincial life by wondering about the cosmopolitan background of the Countess Olenska.) In “To the Lighthouse,” Virginia Woolf uses Eliot’s novel to convey the social and intellectual anxiety experienced by Minta Doyle, one of the Ramsays’ houseguests, who is afraid of Mr. Ramsay’s literary dinner-table conversation, “for she had left the third volume of ‘Middlemarch’ in the train and she never knew what happened in the end.” (Ultimately, she resolves her social awkwardness by pretending to be “even more ignorant than she was, because he liked telling her she was a fool.”)

More recently, Adelle Waldman joined this honorable tradition with “ The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P. ” Her characters, gathered at a housewarming party, discuss the fate of Eliot’s Tertius Lydgate, the ambitious doctor whose professional aspirations are ruined by his misguided choice in marriage. Eliot was “not exactly unbiased,” one character observes. “Smart women have a personal stake in vilifying men who fail to appreciate smart women.” Eliot’s themes—the difficulties of communication within and without marriage; the limitations placed on women’s accomplishments and expectations by restrictive social structures; the gradual substitution of resignation in the place of aspiration—have proved enduringly inspiring to generations of writers, as well as readers. But the density of the novel’s structure, and its psychological complexity, seem to have rendered it too daunting for “Clueless”-like efforts at a wholesale relocation to a new context.

Which means that one ongoing attempt to do so is worth watching, for its ambition as well as for its charm. “Middlemarch: The Series,” written and directed by Rebecca Shoptaw, an undergraduate in the film department at Yale, is a Web serial that will run, ultimately, to seventy episodes. So far, the first half is available online ; the series will start up again in August. Shoptaw has recast Eliot’s residents of the provincial town of Middlemarch as students at Lowick College, in the fictional town of Middlemarch, Connecticut. Dorothea Brooke, Eliot’s heroine, is now Dot Brooke, an idealistic, thoughtful sophomore, played by a Yale undergrad named Mia Fowler, who has a beguiling vulnerability and intelligence on camera. Dot has yet to figure out her major, and has decided to film herself and her friends for a year, just to see what she can make of the results. “I feel like if we can watch and understand where we are now, it will help us figure out what we want to do later,” she says in the first episode. “And, it’s like, half the time we just sit and wait for things to happen.” The series, which largely consists of Dot and her friends speaking directly to the camera, is filmed in settings intended to suggest a variety of dorm rooms, as well as in the kitchen of a pizza parlor known as Stone Court (which is, actually, a pretty good name for a pizza parlor).

In her previous work, available on her YouTube channel, Shoptaw has mined classic literature for L.G.B.T.Q. themes. In one video , she has taken Shakespeare’s Sonnet 23, which begins, “As an unperfect actor on the stage / Who with his fear is put beside his part,” and turned it into a gay love story just short of four minutes long. Her most notable innovation with “Middlemarch: The Series” is gender-bending the cast, envisioning a social group in which gender identity and sexual orientation are variable and possibly mutable. Sir James Chettam, Dorothea Brooke’s first suitor, is, in Eliot’s novel, the picture of conservative conformity. In Shoptaw’s reimagining, Chettam becomes Jamie, a meek scientist who wears a knit beanie and a buttoned-up shirt and hides behind a pair of owlish spectacles, and whose preferred gender pronoun is “they.” (Jamie is played by Lola Hourihane, whose cast bio reveals, “They previously played a wall in ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream,’ a performance which brought their grandmother to tears (of shame).”) Mary Garth, the quiet, diligent young woman whom many readers have seen as the alternative heroine of Eliot’s story, has been turned into Max Garth, a gay townie who resembles Mary in his humility and intelligence, if not in his appearance. Mary Garth, whom Eliot describes as “brown,” has “a broad face and square brow, well-marked eyebrows and curly dark hair,” characteristics that, in the world of Eliot’s “Middlemarch,” amount to plain and ordinary. Kai Nugent, the African-American actor who plays Max, also has a broad face, square brow, well-marked eyebrows, and curly dark hair, but on him these features read as strikingly handsome.

In an interview with the Web site Fandomania, Shoptaw said that she was able to imagine “Middlemarch” through this L.G.B.T.Q. lens because, unlike other Victorian novels she had read, its “healthier relationships are almost entirely free of the gendered power dynamics that too often shape the relationships in classic novels.” Shoptaw has distinguished company in questioning the gendered characterizations of figures in “Middlemarch.” Henry James, who was alert to such issues, wondered in particular about the masculinity of Will Ladislaw, with whom Dorothea falls in love. James found Ladislaw unconvincing: “vague and impalpable . . . a woman’s man.” In Shoptaw’s reworking, Ladislaw becomes Billie, played by a female actor who goes by the name C. B. G., and it will be interesting to see, as the series progresses, how faithfully Shoptaw renders the ultimate subsuming of Dorothea’s ambitions and identity into those of Ladislaw—a fictional conclusion that many feminist readers, from the eighteen-seventies until today, have considered a capitulation on the part of Eliot.

But one might also take issue with Shoptaw’s suggestion that the novel’s “healthier relationships” are where the story’s principal focus lies. It is true that the relationship between Mary Garth and Fred Vincy—perhaps the healthiest in the book—could be seen as a model of gender equity, or at least parity. But Eliot’s greatest accomplishment in “Middlemarch” is to anatomize bad relationships—to show, with excruciating psychological penetration, the ways in which individuals fail to recognize one another, becoming disappointed and embittered by a partner’s failure to measure up to fantasy. If the marriages between Dorothea and Edward Casaubon, her pedantic scholar husband, and Lydgate and Rosamond Vincy, the stubbornly conventional town beauty, were healthier, they would be a lot less compelling to read about.

On the evidence of the episodes released so far, Shoptaw has been faithful to Eliot’s slow-moving world of Middlemarch, while also taking some necessary liberties with the complexity of the novel. With a cast of only ten, some of the functions of Eliot’s minor characters have been subsumed into her major ones. Bulstrode, Middlemarch’s pious, overweening banker, has remained offscreen; he is the funder of an internship that Fred Vincy—played with boyish gusto by Oliver Shoulson—assumes he’s going to win, and doesn’t. It’s too early to know for sure, but it seems likely that Shoptaw has eliminated one major strand that Eliot developed in “Middlemarch”: Bulstrode’s rise and his shaming fall, which is crucial in contributing to the novel’s monumental gravity. And thus far, at least, Shoptaw’s Lydgate is an arrogant chump, whose confident aspirations are played for comedy—“What does that bracelet mean? Or is it just a hair scrunchie?” he asks Rosamond—rather than reaching the dimension of tragedy, which is the light in which Eliot saw his struggle and his renunciation. Shoptaw is on surer ground with the character of Rosamond, who is convinced that her flirtation with Lydgate is an I.R.L. rom-com—a fitting update of Eliot’s suggestion that Rosamond has gathered all her ideas about love from second-rate novels.

Still, it’s an impossibly tall order to expect a Web series to approach the nuance of a nineteenth-century novel—of the nineteenth-century novel. And there are moments in which Shoptaw’s chosen medium offers useful narrative devices that weren’t available to Eliot. Casaubon’s explanation of his unbearably dull research dissertation—“Being and World: Transcendental Otherness and Identity”—is given as a sequence of short cuts, thus rendered even more incomprehensible. (In Shoptaw’s retelling, Casaubon, Dorothea’s much older scholar husband, is a grad student. Presumably to cast him as a professor would have violated Lowick College’s consensual-relations code, which, if it is anything like Yale’s, forbids any sexual or amorous relationship between teachers and undergrads.) And Shoptaw’s use of the video camera as an opportunity for intimate confessional is a clever substitute for Eliot’s narrative technique of describing the inner life of her characters, and showing the ways in which their understanding of themselves and others is circumscribed by their restricted points of view.

There is also a winning affection for the nineteenth-century novel in Shoptaw’s project: she clearly loves “Middlemarch,” and feels enriched by having read it. And for non-college-aged viewers, the series serves as a poignant representation of undergrad life as, apparently, it is lived now. In “ Rain Check ,” the best episode of the series so far, Dot and Billie find themselves alone on a rainy afternoon in Casaubon’s apartment, with a couple of cameras at hand. They film themselves goofing about—drawing cartoonish pictures of each other, and taking an online quiz to find out which Hogwarts house each would belong to. Deliberately or not, Shoptaw reminds her viewers that, for her generation—indeed, for everyone under the age of thirty-five—reading the Harry Potter books is far more likely to constitute their most formative literary experience than is reading “Middlemarch,” or any other Victorian novel, for that matter.

In the episode, Dot and Billie lie on the rug together—a reference to Eliot’s preferred metaphor for Ladislaw’s bohemianism, which is indicated by his predilection for lying around on his friends’ carpets. (In Eliot’s novel, Dorothea doesn’t get to do it with him.) Flat on the floor, with the camera looking down on them, they exchange what they understand to be the meaning of life. “To flourish and help others flourish,” Billie offers, with quiet certitude. Dot is more provisional. “I really don’t know,” she says. “Maybe you’re supposed to figure it out. Like, the meaning of life is to continuously try to find the meaning of life.” It’s a lovely moment, conveying a spirit of youth and uncertainty—the same spirit that George Eliot sought to bring to the page almost a hundred and fifty years ago. In it, Shoptaw captures what remains constant about the restless inquiries of young people who want their lives to be meaningful, no matter what has changed about the world they may find themselves in the middle of."
454,http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/an-opera-of-russias-brutal-history,newyorker,An Opera of Russia’s Brutal History,[],"A great nation is in turmoil. A dynasty that everyone assumed would rule forever has extinguished itself; a band of usurpers ride in from the hinterlands, their immense ambition matched by their strange customs and love of bling. Authority is established, but mayhem ensues. Sound familiar?

This isn’t Donald Trump’s Washington, D.C., but Russia in the Time of Troubles, the early-seventeenth-century period in which Antonín Dvořák set his opera “Dimitrij” (1882), which the conductor Leon Botstein is mounting at Bard SummerScape, directed by Anne Bogart, on five nights between July 28 and Aug. 6. A tale of idealism, intrigue, and failed love, it will be the marquee opera in a summer season that otherwise focusses on the musical world of Chopin, who revolutionized the intimate realm of piano music but, to the disappointment of his Polish countrymen, made no contribution to the lyric stage.

Poland figures big in “Dimitrij”: its noblemen give unofficial backing to the so-called False Dmitry—the first of three consecutive rogues who pretended to be the youngest son of Ivan the Terrible—allowing him to invade Russia and, after the unexpected death of Tsar Boris Godunov, assume power. (It’s unlikely that Dvořák and his librettist, Marie Červinková-Riegrová, knew of Mussorgsky’s “Boris Godunov,” but their work begins where that story ends.) “Dimitrij,” like many of the operas that Botstein chooses to present, never really found a place in the repertory, despite its composer’s fame. But the favorable response to the Met’s new production, earlier this year, of Dvořák’s most popular opera, “Rusalka,” may encourage audiences to further explore the lyrical treasures of the Czech master.

Like “Rusalka,” “Dimitrij” is known for a prominent soprano aria. But whereas the former opera’s “Song to the Moon” is a solitary utterance, the aria for Marina, the Polish woman who has married Dimitrij for the sake of power rather than love, is backed by vigorous choral writing, with the Poles celebrating their victory in roisterous mazurka rhythms and the Russian crowd keening their disapproval in strains that echo music of the Russian Orthodox Church. (SummerScape operagoers look forward to the sterling contributions of the Bard Festival Chorale.) Like the water sprite Rusalka, Dimitrij learns too late the fickleness of the human heart. Yet his disaster is no fairy tale—it is inspired by the real-life tragedy of an entire people. ♦"

The winner moves on to represent the CONCACAF region—countries from North America, Central America, and the Caribbean—at the quadrennial Confederations Cup, a dress rehearsal, of sorts, for the World Cup. For many countries, the Gold Cup is primarily an opportunity for coaches to observe young and fringe players in the hopes of strengthening their teams for the big show.

For the United States, however, this year’s tournament took on a little extra significance. Last November, the men’s national team struggled through the final round of World Cup qualifying, losing in heartbreaking fashion to Mexico and then getting thoroughly embarrassed a few days later by Costa Rica. That left the United States at the bottom of the region’s World Cup qualifying table. Coach Jürgen Klinsmann was fired, and replaced by Bruce Arena, whose largely unruffled disposition sits in contrast to a more excitable Klinsmann, and who coached the national team for several years in the late nineties and early two thousands. Arena was supposed to restore the confidence of the American players, believed by many to have dwindled during Klinsmann’s bumpy tenure.

On Wednesday, in Santa Clara, California, the U.S. faced off against Jamaica in the Gold Cup final. The Jamaicans, dubbed the Reggae Boyz, were the tournament’s upstarts, advancing farther than anyone expected, thanks to talented youngsters and the magisterial performances of the goalkeeper Andre Blake. The match remained deadlocked for most of the first half, until the forty-fifth minute, when the veteran striker Jozy Altidore put the U.S. ahead on a free kick from about thirty yards out. Altidore, a longtime fixture on the national team, has struggled in recent years to make his mark in a major tournament, thanks to recurring hamstring injuries. But when the referee blew his whistle for the free kick, he steadied himself, took two steps toward the ball, and struck it with force and composure. The ball curled around a wall of four Jamaican defenders, ascending and bending toward the left side of the goal, and past the outstretched arms of Dwayne Miller, Jamaica’s backup goalkeeper. (Blake was taken off the field with an injured hand in the nineteenth minute of the game.) Altidore thumped the U.S. crest on the left side of his jersey.

Altidore, whose parents came to the United States from Haiti, is one of many sons of immigrants on the U.S. team. There’s Omar Gonzalez, whose parents are from Mexico; Matt Miazga, the son of Polish immigrants; Darlington Nagbe, born in Liberia; and Juan Agudelo, who was born in Colombia. Watching them celebrate, I thought of the kids I had seen the day before playing soccer at a park near my home, in Washington, D.C. Their foreheads glistened in the afternoon sun, their brown bodies moved with the raucous howl of their adolescent voices. With the promise of that pluralism seemingly under siege as of late, the rejoicing of the men’s team felt almost defiant.

Jamaica bounced back in the fiftieth minute with a splendid goal by Je-Vaughn Watson, who had jostled his way free from the U.S. forward Jordan Morris to volley home a corner kick. Morris looked visibly distraught, his man having evaded his mark, but he found redemption in the game’s closing minutes. After a cross from Gyasi Zardes bounced around the box, Morris pounced on the ball from about sixteen yards out and powered a shot past Miller in the goalbox to give the U.S the lead again. Morris giddily sprinted to the sideline, where his teammates encircled him, jumping up and down with unbridled joy.

There are tough World Cup qualifying matches to come: the team must win a slate of contests to secure a trip to an eighth consecutive World Cup, in Russia, in 2018. For one evening, though, regardless of the larger significance—or insignificance—of the Gold Cup, we could celebrate a team that looks like the country we are quickly becoming, and perhaps the country we have always been."

How apropos for our yellow-haired queen of mayhem. “On a night like this, you came into the world,” Tyrion says. He, Varys, Daenerys, Grey Worm, and Missandei are in the Map Room, looking like a bunch of evil geniuses. Dragonstone is quite something: cavelike walls, torch sconces, ghastly, eye-socket-like windows overlooking the dark seas. There’s a map-covered table dotted with chess-type pieces—“not so many lions,” Dany says, meaning the Lannisters. The Queen and her advisers have a bracing chat. Sure, they could take Westeros, with their dragons and whatnot—but to what end? “You’re not here to be queen of the ashes,” Tyrion says. They talk about transparency, trust, and the nature of government. Dany tells Varys to promise that if he wants to criticize her, he should do it to her face, not behind her back. He swears it.

“If you ever betray me, I’ll burn you alive,” she says.

“I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons,” he says. These two! The moment is ruined by the arrival of—ugh!—Melisandre. She tries to butter up Dany with the “I used to be a slave” routine, then starts talking about the Lord of Light’s prophecies about who will bring the dawn (ugh again) and then moves on to Jon Snow. Now you’re talking!

“He sounds like quite a man,” Dany says. Oh, he is.

Tyrion pipes up. “I can’t speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow, and I trusted him. And I’m an excellent judge of character,” he says. They send Jon an invitation raven.

At Winterfell, the courtyard is once again being used for combat practice below and strategizing above. Jon Snow and Sansa are reading letters. Ah, a letter from Tyrion! These Season 7 episodes are moving along briskly, as are the mails.

Meanwhile, at Cersei’s, things are a bit more . . . intense. In her fiery throne room, she’s talking to a crowd, including some bannermen of House Tyrell, about rape, murder, butchering, Lady Olenna, the Mad King, and Dany, in a highly unflattering manner. Spin, one might call it. Jaime is smirking a little. Look how happy she is, he’s thinking. She deserves this. The people listening seem slightly less psyched. In a corridor, Jaime tries to get Samwell Tarly’s dad, Randyll Tarly, to pledge his loyalty to the Lannister side of things, which would include fighting Olenna Tyrell’s people. “I’m a Tarly,” Tarly says. “I swore an oath to House Tyrell. I’ve known Olenna since I was a child.” Jaime isn’t having it. “She brought the Dothraki to our shores!” he says. “Do you fight with us, or with the foreign savages and eunuchs?” I’ve come to love Jaime, but his vision of government has limited appeal. He tries to sweet-talk him: “When the war is won, the Queen will need a new Warden of the South,” he says, practically wiggling his eyebrows.

At the Citadel, Tarly the younger is looking depressed: the man whose horrible Greyscaled arm he discovered last week has only six months to live, Archmaester Jim Broadbent tells him. Sam looks even more flummoxed when the maester pooh-poohs his medical advice—and further still when he discovers the patient’s identity. “Mormont!” Sam says. He might be thinking, This guy’s dad saved me from a wight in Season 3 ! Now I will save him from the Crud That Cannot Be Scraped Off.

At King’s Landing, Cersei is looking pleased in the Lair of Dragon Skulls. Wait till she sees Dragonstone—if she wins this shebang, perhaps she can use it as a summer house. Her trusty aide Qyburn, who made Jaime’s prosthetic hand, among other medical and murderous innovations, has rigged up what he hopes is a good dragon-shooter: a giant crossbow. Cersei optimistically fires it at a dragon skull, and seems to wound it.

At Dragonstone, the party is really getting off the ground. Guests include the better Greyjoys, Yara and Theon, and the whole Dorne contingent—Ellaria Sand, some Sand Snakes, and dear old Olenna Tyrell. They are in town and fired up ! What do they want? War! When do they want it? Now! Our team has got boats and dragons, let’s do this. It will be a cinch! “I am not here to be queen of the ashes,” Dany says, sagely. Tyrion, moving some pieces around the map, says that they won’t appeal to their enemies’ nationalism by having the Unsullied storm the capital: they will have the Greyjoys and the Dornish and Tyrell armies do it. (How convenient, Lady Olenna says.) Tyrion proposes that Grey Worm and the Unsullied capture the Lannisters’ true seat of power, Casterly Rock. Everybody eventually agrees to this. Lady Olenna is still wearing her adorable hat and veil, and dispensing wise, cranky wisdom like there’s no tomorrow. “May I speak with you alone?” Dany asks Olenna. She scoffs at Cersei, at the concept of peace, and at Tyrion. “Clever men—I outlive them all. You know why? I ignore them,” she says. “Are you a sheep? No. You’re a dragon. Be a dragon.” Every show should have a Lady Olenna/Dowager Countess figure. Every life should have one, in fact. I am currently accepting applications.

The next scene, unexpectedly, begins as a tender, wounded goodbye between Grey Worm, who’s off to capture the true seat of power, and Missandei—“You are my weakness,” he says—and abruptly turns into perhaps the hottest eunuch sex scene of all time. They kiss; she boldly disrobes; he is worried about his pants area; she isn’t; they move to the bed, toned and lit by torchlight; and the scene takes a satisfyingly Jane Campion-ish direction, in which women’s rights are fully respected. Just before the apex of things, the scene cuts to a library bookshelf, and a hand unshelving a book. Oh, yeah .

That book means that Sam Tarly is at it again. He goes to Jorah Mormont’s room with a cart of secret potions, introduces himself properly, and announces that he’ll be trying out an experimental Greyscale procedure few else would attempt. “Please try not to scream,” he says kindly, giving Jorah something to bite on and getting out his knives and pastes. Dr. Tarly is in!

Arya continues to eat her way across Westeros, heading to King’s Landing. At a pub, she runs into her old friend Hot Pie, and they compare crust-making techniques. “You’ve been making pies,” he says.

“One or two,” she says. He gossips: he’s seen Brienne of Tarth, looking to defend Starks; the great Sept went “boom”; Jon Snow is King in the North; Winterfell is back , baby, and the Boltons are dead. Arya nearly chokes on her buttered crust and gets up. Plans have changed! “You’re pretty,” Hot Pie says. Aw, Hot Pie.

“Take care of yourself, Hot Pie,” she says. “Try not to get killed.”

Jon Snow gets a letter from the Citadel. Why, it’s from Samwell Tarly! Back at the hall of guys, he excitedly hollers the news: Dragonstone is full of dragonglass! He also says that Tyrion is at Dragonstone with Dany, and that they’ve just invited him for a visit, and that they’ve got dragons. He wants to go; nobody else wants him to. “We need to mine it and turn it into weapons!” he says. So far, he’s yelled about mining in two consecutive episodes, and I’m not sure I’m on board for a big mining story line. They also need allies, Jon says. The plan is controversial. Sansa protests that the Mad King roasted their grandfather alive. The hoary old guys are freaking out; even wise little Lyanna Mormont is not on board. Too bad, Jon says. I’m out of here, and Sansa’s in charge. With this she cannot argue. Afterward, Jon Snow and Littlefinger have a whisper fight in front of a statue of Ned Stark, in which Littlefinger tries to ingratiate himself. “I love Sansa and I loved her mother,” Littlefinger whispers.

Jon whips around and thrusts him against the wall. “Touch Sansa and I’ll kill you myself,” he says. Brothers don’t like that kind of talk, Littlefinger, you clown.

Soon, we see him departing on horseback, exchanging a little Jaime-and-Brienne-style wave with Sansa as he trots away.

Arya is in the woods at a fire, alone with her horse, no Ed Sheerans in sight. Perhaps in her head she’s singing that little tune he sang last week. Her horse is freaking out—kind of dancing around—and suddenly there’s an intense wolf-pack situation happening. And then: a giant dog appears, apparently Arya’s long-lost direwolf, who has gone off and started a whole new life in the woods. “Nymeria?” she says. “Nymeria, it’s me.” Nymeria plays it cool. “I’m heading north, girl, back to Winterfell. I’m finally heading home. Come with me.” Nymeria turns away, wanting to stay wild. “It’s not you,” Arya says, echoing a line she’d once said about her own nature. I’m hoping Nymeria is taking mental notes and returns to rip some bad guys’ faces off at some later opportune moment.

In the belly of the Greyjoys’ ship, Theon is looking grim, like he wishes he didn’t have to listen to his sister and Ellaria Sand flirt. Well, he doesn’t for long—there’s an attack! Who should it be but their demented Uncle Euron. The camera cuts to a huge Eeevil thing that approaches with the vibe and ominous music of the ghost ship in “Pirates of the Caribbean,” and Euron, continuing to be an evil madcap, ta-da!s his way on deck via viper-faced drawbridge, hacking his way around in a barrage of grunting, eyeliner, facial hair, and excitement. He laughs; Theon looks more stressed out, and may be morphing back into Reek. Fight fight fight fight fight.

Ships aflame, Greyjoy fleets shrinking. Fire, hatchets—this reminds me of a new bar in New Jersey that I keep hearing about. Euron kills one of the Sand Snakes; it’s what we call an exciting lesser battle, in which characters you don’t particularly like kill characters you don’t care much about, and threaten ones you do. Euron, to his credit, smiles when he fights. I don’t like fighting, but I do like smiling. Yara holds her own with Uncle Euron, jumping on him from a height and getting in some good rage thwacking, but he bests her. As Euron seems poised to kill Yara in front of Theon, Theon, rather than doing anything swashbuckling, trembles, looks pained, and jumps overboard. Euron laughs—O.K., Euron, I’ve changed my mind. Enough laughing! He disappears with Yara, and he’s got her by the throat.

Theon has rediscovered his inner Reek, all right, and Reek is in the water. What’s his plan? I’m not sure he’s sure, either. But he’s in a pickle. Yes, he seems to be panicking, and he could drown. He’s surrounded by flaming ships and hanging corpses. But he’s sensitive, so don’t rule him out. Sometimes the sensitive types can surprise you. He could join the ranks of the Mysteriously Offscreen. Or he could drown. One thing is clear: when word gets back to Dragonstone, Tyrion is going to have to rearrange some chess pieces in the Map Room."
457,http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/novelizing-greek-myth,newyorker,Novelizing Greek Myth,[],"Nobody liked to fiddle with Greek myths more than the Greeks did. Take, for example, one of the best-known tales from the vast web of stories that circulated about the Trojan War: Agamemnon, the victorious Greek general, comes home to his kingdom after ten years only to be murdered by his queen, Clytemnestra, and her lover, Aegisthus—a crime later avenged by the dead king’s children. In Homer’s Odyssey, composed around 750 B.C., the main villain is Aegisthus, a cad who seduces the weak-willed Clytemnestra and then ambushes the recently returned king and his retainers at a feast, slaughtering them in a grotesque parody of a real battle, the bodies lying among the scattered crockery. (Aegisthus may have had his reasons: according to some, his two brothers were murdered by Agamemnon’s father and served up to their own father at a feast, baked in a pie.) Three centuries later, Clytemnestra took center stage—literally. In the first part of the Oresteia (458 B.C.), a trilogy of tragedies by Aeschylus, the queen fulsomely welcomes her husband home from Troy; then she lures him into a bathtub and hacks him and his Trojan concubine to death. Unlike Homer, Aeschylus gave Clytemnestra a powerful motivation for her treachery. At the beginning of the play, the chorus recalls how, at the outset of the Trojan War, Agamemnon sacrificed his and Clytemnestra’s daughter Iphigenia, in order to propitiate an angry god and win fair winds for his fleet to sail to Troy. The Oresteia established a more or less canonical version of the events that rippled outward from these retributive homicides. In the second play of the trilogy, the couple’s two surviving children, Orestes and Electra, are reunited as adults after a long separation and then scheme to murder their mother and her lover. (In a scene that came to embarrass later dramatists, Electra is persuaded that her brother has returned after she discovers a footprint and a lock of hair at their father’s tomb—which, she concludes, must belong to her long-lost brother because the footprint is the same size as hers and the hair is similar.) The third play features Western literature’s first courtroom drama: Orestes, pursued by the vengeful Furies for the murder of Clytemnestra, is put on trial for matricide but is eventually acquitted—in part because his defense lawyer, who happens to be the god Apollo, argues that matricide isn’t such a big deal since, after all, the man is the only “true parent,” and the woman merely “nurses the seed.” No wonder scholarly studies of this work have such titles as “The Dynamics of Misogyny.” Over the next half-century, playwrights teased out the implications of the story’s irresistibly schematic pairings and oppositions: between justice and vengeance, male and female, parents and children, free will and fate, the claims of family feeling and the exigencies of state policy. Sophocles wrote an “Electra” whose heroine is a counterpart to his Antigone—a fierce virgin who defies convention in her obsessive quest to avenge family wrongs. As time passed, a note of irreverence crept in: in Euripides’ “Electra,” Aeschylus’ grim moralizing and Sophocles’ agonized psychologizing have been edged aside by an almost postmodern willingness to poke fun at literary models. In this version, Electra refuses to believe that the lock of hair discovered at her father’s tomb belongs to Orestes since, as she exasperatedly points out, siblings don’t necessarily have identical hair. In the same playwright’s “Orestes,” produced in 408 B.C., shortly before he died, the siblings, awaiting execution after their trial for matricide, hatch a plan that, for sheer ad-hoc nuttiness, would give the villains in “Fargo” a run for their money. Enraged by their dilemma, they plot to murder Helen of Troy (Clytemnestra’s sister), hold her innocent daughter hostage (they nab her after she goes to offer a lock of hair at a tomb), and torch the royal palace. “Set the parapets ablaze!” Orestes cries at the play’s climax, and it’s hard not to feel that that’s pretty much what the play is doing to the mythic tradition. Many scholars have seen in these fantastical riffs on the ancient tale a sign that the genre of tragedy had exhausted itself. The Princeton classicist Froma I. Zeitlin suggests that, by the time Euripides wrote “Orestes,” he had diverged so extravagantly from myth (“the relatively closed and predetermined form”) that he ended up straying into a genre that hadn’t been invented yet: what we call fiction (“the mode of new possibilities marked by a receptivity to experimentation and change”). And yet, although authors working in a number of genres have revisited the plots and characters of Greek tragedy—from Ovid’s playful verse epic Metamorphoses, in the first century A.D., to “Mourning Becomes Electra,” Eugene O’Neill’s 1931 updating of the Oresteia narrative to the Civil War era—the genre has tended to resist novelistic adaptation. Epic, by contrast, has proved a rich source of temptation for novelists: recent attempts include works as diverse as David Malouf’s “Ransom,” which finds space in a climactic scene from the Iliad to explore themes of mortality, forgiveness, and, indeed, novelistic originality (in it, the Trojan king, Priam, wonders whether he can break out of his usual role and think of something new to do); Margaret Atwood’s “The Penelopiad,” a feminist retelling of the Odyssey from the point of view of Odysseus’ queen and her twelve maids; and Madeline Miller’s “The Song of Achilles,” a breathless reimagining of the relationship between the Iliad’s Achilles and his companion, Patroclus. But whereas the weave of epic is loose, leaving spaces for expansion and adaptation, the tragedies—many of which, we should remember, were themselves adaptations of episodes from epic—are highly compressed, almost hermetic. The contemporary mainstream novel, which is realistic in technique and concerned, more often than not, with the lives and psychologies of ordinary people, doesn’t seem an ideal vessel for tragedy, with its stiffly operatic formal conventions, its grandiose royal protagonists, and its plots inflected by the supernatural. And, as “ House of Names ” (Scribner), a new novel by the Irish writer Colm Tóibín, suggests, the Oresteia narrative in particular—precisely because it has already been endlessly reimagined, reworked, expanded, and adapted—poses special problems for even the most inventive and subtle writers.

Like his ancient predecessors, Tóibín wants both to enhance and to interrogate a much told tale. A nice touch is that, in “House of Names,” Clytemnestra and Electra each get to tell their own stories: chapters devoted to their first-person narratives of the familiar events alternate with sections about Orestes’ adventures. The Orestes story is related in the third person, a device that deprives the eponymous hero of Aeschylus’ trilogy of his own voice—the author’s sly riposte, perhaps, to the fact that in so many Greek myths women’s concerns, like their bodies, are subordinated to those of men. Still, at the beginning of the novel, events hew so closely to the Greek originals that you may wonder why the author has bothered to retell this old tale at all. The first section consists of Clytemnestra’s bitter account of the events leading up to Iphigenia’s sacrifice, lingering on how Agamemnon tricked her into bringing their daughter to the port of Aulis, where the Greek fleet had gathered, on the pretext that she was to be married to Achilles. This version of the story is lifted more or less intact from one of Euripides’ final plays, “Iphigenia in Aulis.” But before long a number of additions, omissions, and tweaks to the Greek versions make it clear that Tóibín is just as comfortable playing around with the traditional narrative as Euripides was. In “Iphigenia at Aulis,” Clytemnestra begs Agamemnon to stop the sacrifice, an act that, she knows, will turn her into a murderess. But what, you always wondered, went on between the husband and wife just after the horrific ritual was performed? Tóibín ingeniously fills in the gap. His Clytemnestra doesn’t witness her daughter’s sacrifice, because Agamemnon has his wife thrown into a hole in the ground for a few days, just to let her know who’s in charge—and to prevent her from using her dark female magic to foil his plans. When she emerges, she’s feral, starving, covered in her own waste. In the Oresteia, after Clytemnestra has slaughtered her husband and his concubine, she exults over the bodies in a speech notorious for its unhinged grisliness (among other things, she compares the blood in which she’s drenched to a nourishing rain). Tóibín vividly enhances our sense of what unhinged her. Tóibín has also mastered Euripides’ tart literary allusiveness. Like the Greek playwright, he includes a rather sour recognition scene in his story: “Can you tell them that I . . . have come back?” “They won’t believe me,” she said. “Can you cut a lock of my hair and show it to my mother?” he asked. “Your hair has changed,” she said, “You have changed. I didn’t recognize you.” You imagine that, when Euripides’ audience first saw “Electra” and got to the part where the heroine irritably observes that siblings don’t have identical hair, people chuckled—they recognized the (perhaps fond) jab at the archaic credulity of Aeschylus’ recognition scene. But in his riff on the scene Tóibín out-Euripideses Euripides. Here the youth who’s come home after a long absence and has to prove his identity to his sister isn’t Orestes but a made-up character called Leander, Orestes’ best friend and sometime lover. (The two men, we learn, met as children, when they were imprisoned on Aegisthus’ orders, soon after Agamemnon’s murder, in a kind of Mycenaean reform school. This episode, as well as the boys’ subsequent adventures after they escape, is an invention that satisfyingly fills in another awkward gap—what Orestes was up to between the sacrifice of his sister and his reappearance as a young adult bent on vengeance.) Tóibín’s simultaneous allusion to and sidestepping of the older myths, his lithe entwining of mimicry and innovation, give his novel a very Euripidean feel. But Tóibín is interested in more than mere literary gamesmanship. In an article for the Guardian earlier this year, he described why he finds the old myth still relevant. The sectarian violence in Ireland during his youth, he wrote, seemed to him a perfect parallel to the retributive horrors described by Aeschylus in the Oresteia: “For any student of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, no event was isolated. Each murder or set of murders seemed to have been inspired by a previous one, each atrocity appeared to be in retaliation for something that had occurred the week before.” Another thing that he wanted to explore, he went on, was a paradox all too familiar from Ireland’s and, indeed, the world’s troubles: how otherwise ordinary people become agents of atrocity. He cited Asma al-Assad, the British-born wife of Syria’s President, as an example, and something of her, perhaps, finds its way into Tóibín’s portrayal of Clytemnestra. Here she is both a mother fretting about her children—she’s much more sympathetic to Orestes and Electra than her character is in the Greek plays—and a queen who doesn’t ask too many questions when it turns out that Aegisthus is keeping the rebellious nobles in line by holding their young sons and grandsons hostage."

Pouring past the boardwalk, the surge of corrosive salt water arrived at Surf Avenue thick with debris. Dick Zigun—the sixty-four-year-old tattooed impresario of the nonprofit that administers the bar and the iconic circus sideshow next door (a live ten-act spectacle featuring, among other oddities, a contortionist, a sword swallower, and a snake charmer)—was devastated. “Most of what we had didn’t survive,” he said on a recent Saturday afternoon at the bar, over a Coney Island Mermaid Pilsner. (No liquor here, but on a hot summer day the beer and wine offerings—which also include the home-town brewery’s watermelon ale—are refreshment enough.) Among the casualties was Zigun’s 1963 Seeburg jukebox. Gone, too, were scores of antique tchotchkes he had collected over three decades. With guidance from FEMA , an ad-hoc six-person recovery crew led by a former fire-eater salvaged what it could. A cherry-red countertop was re-created with steel and sealed wood, and the remaining ornaments migrated to conspicuously higher ground. By summer, the Freak Bar had reprised its role as the peninsula’s premier chamber of Coney Island kitsch, and as a quiet oasis for curious wayfarers seeking refuge from the sun. “Some day, the water is going to come back,” Zigun said, with cheery stoicism. “We’re much better prepared.” As a cavalier jab to the gods, he had cartoonish wave lines decaled across the windows, marking the height of the storm water. Suddenly, a loud siren blared, signalling to patrons in board shorts and bikinis that the next freak show would soon begin. ♦"

463,http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-surprising-things-statistics-tell-us-about-fiction,newyorker,The Surprising Things Statistics Tell Us About Fiction,[],"In high school, writing term papers on the family PC, I’d often turn to Microsoft Word’s “readability statistics” feature to make sure I sounded smart enough. With a few clicks, Word assigned my papers a Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level: a number from one to twelve indicating how many years of education the average reader would need to have completed in order to decipher my language. I had no idea how Word made this calculation, but I noticed that it rewarded prolix sentences with a higher “grade.” So that’s what I wrote. I put my every word choice under close scrutiny. Soon my paragraphs buckled under the weight of clauses and polysyllables, but I, a ninth grader, was generating prose that only twelfth graders could read—which made me pretty hot shit, my thinking went.

Those Flesch-Kincaid trials came back to me as I read “ Nabokov’s Favorite Word Is Mauve: What the Numbers Reveal About the Classics, Bestsellers, and Our Own Writing ,” by Ben Blatt, which looks at the canon as a statistical gold mine to be dredged for patterns, variances, and singularities. In “literary experiments” on diction, punctuation, cliffhangers, clichés, and other aspects of style and usage, Blatt uses data to probe the body of conventional wisdom that surrounds creative writing. What if those who allegedly loathe adverbs are actually completely, totally addicted to them? What if it’s quite O.K. to use intensifiers very often, because Jane Austen is rather fond of them? What if I like exclamation points! Blatt’s jacket bio cites “his fun approach to data journalism”—a bit of prolepsis, maybe, aimed at those of us who’d sooner watch paint dry than look at anything quantitatively—and his book is laden with charts, lists, and tables printed in a gentle purple. The lessons here are valuable because of their workmanlike cast, not in spite of it. Put aside the “fun approach” and “Mauve” makes some enticingly heretical observations: that every great writer is a technician, every novel a mere agglomeration of prose effects.

The book is built on agreeable miscellany, and parts of it are willfully trivial. On the face of it, there’s not much to be gleaned from the fact that James Joyce uses 1,105 exclamation points per hundred thousand words, or that J. R. R. Tolkien leans too often on “suddenly,” that most accursed of adverbs. Blatt’s findings are more absorbing when he ditches the bean-counter approach. American writers of Harry Potter fan fiction are actually more liable to use “brilliant” than their British counterparts, who employ the word with native agility. And, in a study of erotica written by New Yorkers, Blatt notes a preponderance of the following words: subway, popsicle, senator, butthole, museum, landlord, thrusted, Jacuzzi, sin, and shrugs. Most of these choices are intuitive, even laudable—but what explains those last three? I grasp that a New Yorker might lust for a senator with a popsicle in his butthole; a shrugging sinner in a hot tub doesn’t quite rate.

Blatt’s research on diction and gender is especially revelatory. Looking at a broad swath of twentieth-century lit, he tallies the verbs most often used to describe one gender over another. The results find rich deposits of sexism running through the language. Male characters are most likely to mutter, grin, shout, chuckle, and kill; women are doomed to shiver, weep, murmur, scream, and marry. Male authors are far likelier to write “she interrupted” than “he interrupted.” A grim typology begins to emerge. Men are raffish, jolly, murderous sorts, while women are delicate and meek, except when they deign to interrupt men, as they often do. There’s some sexual self-loathing across the board, too: when writers assign verbs to someone of the opposite gender, they most often reach for “kiss,” “exclaim,” “answer,” “love,” and “smile”; characters of the same gender “hear,” “wonder,” “lay,” “hate,” and “run.”

The high point of the book is Blatt’s effort “to test whether something like a literary fingerprint exists for famous writers.” It does, he finds­—across their oeuvres, “authors do end up writing in a way that is both unique and consistent, just like an actual fingerprint is distinct and unchanging.” Even the way that writers deploy simple pairs of words—“and” and “the,” “these” and “then,” “what” and “but”—is often enough to identify them. The numbers bear out a romantic idea: that a writer is always ineluctably herself. Soon, Blatt zeroes in on writers’ “favorite” words—hence his title, indicating Nabokov’s predilection for “mauve.” The words must be used in half an author’s books, at least once per hundred thousand words; they can’t be proper nouns. His discoveries are startlingly apt. Almost without fail, the words evoke their authors’ affinities and manias. John Cheever favors “venereal”—a perfect encapsulation of his urbane midcentury erotics, tinged with morality. Isaac Asimov prefers “terminus,” a word ensconced in a swooping, stately futurism; Woolf has her “mantelpiece,” Wharton her “compunction.” (Melville’s “sperm” is somewhat misleading, perhaps, when separated from his whales.)

Cumulatively, these facts and figures make “Mauve” an effective craft book. By reminding us that literature is just strings of words and punctuation, Blatt has taken the whiff of the godhead out of it. Writers like to emphasize the psychology in their work, their strenuous labor toward depth and verisimilitude; they’re less inclined to talk about how few decent synonyms exist for “good.” The stats speak a cold truth: there are dozens of prosaic choices behind every artful sentence. Dwelling on this can inoculate writers against the preciousness of the workshop. “Mauve” has no truck with showing instead of telling, no druthers about sense of place or voice. Even in great books, it says, one word follows another, all of them slaves to grammar, sequence, and probability.

Then again, as the figures pile up, claustrophobia sets in. I caught myself wishing I worked in a less quantifiable medium. Ceramicists, for instance, never seem to answer to the Blatts of the world. Like the Flesch-Kincaid formula, which Blatt mentions in a passage about the verbal simplicity of children’s literature, “Mauve” and its number-crunching can feel joyless—the equivalent of an architecture critic who counts the number of bricks in a façade. At his weakest, Blatt sounds like a tour guide over a loudspeaker. “It’s by noting the role of each word and punctuation mark,” he writes, “that the greats are able to hone their writing”—an observation that at once understates the act of revision and ignores the ecstatic, almost compulsive sloppiness that makes some writers great.

“The written word and the world of numbers should not be kept apart,” Blatt writes, and I think he’s right; what’s frustrating is that no one has yet figured out how they might productively collaborate. Like last year’s “ The Bestseller Code ,” which described an algorithm that predicted the plots of popular novels, “Mauve” wagers that the “digital humanities,” as they’ve uneasily come to be known, can instruct audiences outside of the academy. The book’s finest moments prove that they can—but to what end? Blatt argues that his work is “not an attempt to ‘engineer’ art as much as a way to understand it”: “If you were a band in the 1960s you would want to know how the Beatles were recording their songs.” Maybe so, but is that really what this book professes to teach? Knowing the rate at which Ringo hits his snare drum does not a Beatle make.

Reading “Mauve,” I began to imagine two duelling schools of authorship, both motivated by statistics. In one, writers would cultivate their tics, inhabiting themselves so thoroughly that to encounter them on the page would be like finding their footprints in wet cement. In the other, writers would aspire to defy the data, styling their prose with such intricate, chameleonic grace that no statistician could betray their identity. A few decades ago, the advent of the word processor made it easier than ever to revise on the fly; it also made it easy to dwell on one sentence ad infinitum, gilding the lily where once one would’ve advanced to the next thought. The glut of data is another mixed blessing—past a certain point, writers would do better in a state of blissful ignorance. Otherwise, they might end up with work like my ninth-grade term papers, mannered and overwrought.

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level on this piece, by the way, is a mere 10.3."

Nevertheless her sisters and friends never stopped their persecution, for after she had returned to a place where they could seize her, they bound her fast with a heavy wooden yoke and fed her like a dog with only a little bread and water. . . . No one there had compassion for her wretchedness. —Thomas de Cantimpré (1201-72) How She Was Led Forth from the Body and How She Lived Again

The priest holds the host aloft, the linen sleeves of his alb falling around him like wings. He intones the Agnus Dei, and we sing with him. I can scarcely form the words, my throat is so clotted with grief. Beside me, my sister Gertrude tightens her grasp on my hand. Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi — Christina lies in her coffin, her cheeks sunken, her slender hands crossed over her heart. Now, with her troubled soul gone, Christina is easier to look at; alive, even in sleep, she kicked and growled and twitched. For the first time in the twenty-one years I’ve known her, my sister seems at peace. A grave awaits her in the churchyard, a hole sliced into the earth. Water pools in the cold mud at the bottom, flashing in the sunlight and reflecting the sky. We were five in our family, then three, and now we are just two, and even as I weep for our little sister I thank God that it is Christina in the coffin and not Gertrude, the sister I can’t live without. Miserere nobis. Have mercy on us. I think of our house on the edge of the village, hushed, veiled in honeysuckle. A thread of smoke rises faintly from the chimney, and the coals collapse into ash. I think of our lives as they will be from now on, tranquil and measured. As the music rises around me, I’m enveloped in an unfamiliar sweetness, as if some acid had been drained from my blood. Even this morning, on the way to the church, I couldn’t help noticing that the world was suddenly clean and raw, filled with new color and new light, everything unbearably radiant. I loved Christina, I did! I see this now. She was difficult, yes, unknowable, but I loved her. Generosity floods me, as clear and calm as well water—and gratitude, too, to God, who has let me weep for her. I remember Christina as an infant, that fretful tense-limbed creature. While our mother sat at the spinning wheel, I rocked Christina, begging her to settle. “Hush, hush, just rest now,” I said, and put my finger in her little palm. She gripped it but kept wailing. Now my whole body cries out to hold that memory of my sister’s hand around my finger. We begin the third invocation: Lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the world . . . . We sing, edging closer and closer to that final entreaty: Dona nobis pacem. Grant us peace. Perhaps if we’d hastened, outrun the melody, God might have listened. If we’d only got those last words out, He might have spared us our miracle. Instead: flight. The congregation gasps. I open my wet eyes, the prayer dead on my lips. How to make sense of this? The young woman up there in the rafters is no apparition. Christina was dead, and now she’s alive, eyes shocked and glittering. She perches above us in her gray shift, straddling the beam, dangling two thin legs. Her face is contorted, her color rising, as she wails down at us. She grips the beam, her long fingers pressed so hard against the wood—splintered and rough with adze marks—that afterward they will be bloody. We gaze up in amazement. Gertrude and I clutch each other, because we saw her dead on the floor of our house, cleaned her and dressed her and prayed over her, saw her loaded onto a cart and brought here. But now our sister is back, vibrant and fully herself. Her cries seem to be in another language, but for one refrain: “Why, why, why?” In the hours and days and years that follow, people will report that after my sister rose from the dead and flew high into the rafters of the church she shouted about Purgatory. They will tell of her journey there and back, and to Hell and Heaven, too, and of her interview with God. They will tell how, valuing her soul above others’, He gave her the choice between eternal Paradise and a return to a life of suffering for Him on Earth. But, as I watch my sister swaying and jabbering above me in the church, all I can think is that she has returned to punish me for my hypocrisy, for crying over her body, for thinking I ever loved her. Here Begins the Life of the Holy Christina

May of 1150 is unseasonably cold, and, on the morning that my youngest sister is born, ice glazes the budding trees. Since dawn, Gertrude and I have been waiting outside the house, leaning against the windowsill, the sleeves and fronts of our dresses smudged with whitewash. Our father is away with the flock, due back in a few days, so only Gertrude and I keep watch. Gertrude clutches a softening parsnip in her arms, murmurs to it. She is five, thirteen months younger than me. Already a red-lipped beauty, already a little mother. We try to peer through cracks in the shutters, listening to the cries within, but can’t make out our mother in the murk. Outside, everything is bright and still. No wind blows over the frozen ground. There is no birdsong at all this year. The birds have abandoned the Meuse Valley entirely for somewhere warmer: Spain, maybe. “She won’t live,” the midwife tells us on her way out. She tightens her shawl, then says over her shoulder, “The baby, I mean. I’m sorry. Your mother just needs to rest.” We watch her move down the road to the village. Our mother has lost babies before, so this news is sad, but expected. It’s our mother we’re worried about. With pounding hearts, Gertrude and I hold hands and step into the house. Inside, the air is hot from the stoked fire, thick with the smell of blood and smoke. Our mother turns her face from the light—or maybe she turns her face from us—and presses her cheek to the bedclothes. Christina, our new sister, flails naked on a cloth before the fire, blue-white and thin, full of mucus and outrage. “Give her here, Mara,” our mother says in a watery voice. Tears leak from the corners of her slit eyes. We kneel beside our squalling sister—Gertrude sets down her parsnip gently—and wrap her in the warmed cloth with our four clumsy hands. “Can she be my doll when she’s dead?” Gertrude asks. “Idiot,” I tell her kindly. “She’ll rot and stink, like any dead thing.” But Christina doesn’t die. As a scowling infant, she rejects the breast; later, she picks at her suppers. Yet she grows in spite of herself. At night, as Gertrude and I bend over our carding, Christina watches us, sharp-eyed and peevish, breathing wetly. The Saint’s Childhood

We sell our sheep in the markets of Brustem and Ordingen and Saint-Trond. The three of us accompany our father. Gertrude and I hurry the sheep when they lag with a whack on their spongy bottoms. Christina will not keep up, and she won’t keep to the road, either, but darts along from tree to tree, the underbrush snapping at her feet. Our father no longer raises his voice or drags Christina by the wrist or whips her for lollygagging; he could yell himself hoarse and whip his arm crippled, and still Christina wouldn’t obey. Only eight years old, and already she’s stymied him. One day, as we pass the great walled convent of St. Catherine’s, on the road to Saint-Trond, the gate is opened to allow a cart to pass through. “Gertrude,” I say, and grab her sleeve, because we’ve never seen the gate open. We peer into the cobbled yard while the porter argues with the driver and the sheep nudge our thighs with the bony points of their heads. The morning light seems warmer beyond the gatehouse; there, pink in the rising sun, is the chapel, with its crown of slender finials, there the abbey, all carved arches and gray stone. At the far end of the yard, an archway opens onto another courtyard, beyond which I glimpse a garden. I ache to be there, enclosed in that spot of green, to live day after measured day of prayer and work, each as full and serene as a rosary bead. It is six in the morning; the sisters are in the chapel reciting Prime. Somewhere behind these walls, the cloisters are quiet and waiting. Somewhere else, lay sisters tend to bees in straw apiaries or bend with rakes over rows of waxy cabbages. Then reins are shaken, the cart rattles through, and the gate is shut. “They found a baby in the walls,” Gertrude says. She takes my arm and gives a ram a kick in the side. “A tiny little skeleton. A nun had it in secret and closed it into the wall.” “Liar,” I say. “It’s like I’m actually walking.” “It’s true.” Gertrude presses her red lips, tosses her braid over her shoulder. “Isn’t it awful? A defenseless little baby.” She widens her eyes, as if she’d just had a delicious thought. “Maybe it wasn’t dead. Maybe it was still gurgling when she bricked it in.” “That doesn’t even make sense. Where would a nun get masonry tools?” “Poor Mara.” Gertrude touches my cheek in mock sympathy. “They wouldn’t take you anyway. Not with a sister possessed by the Devil.” We laugh and turn to watch Christina charging through the leaves, head forward, shoulders hunched and purposeful. She glances furtively over her shoulder, then hides behind an oak. Soon she peers around the trunk, eyes narrowed and suspicious, and, when she catches us looking, her expression is one of such loathing that the laugh withers in my throat. Gertrude shudders and squeezes my wrist. “Don’t go. Swear you won’t go and leave me with her.” “Hurry up, Christina!” I shout in a rage. Her hand is motionless on the gnarled bark. When she speaks, her voice is so shrill that you could cut your finger on it. “Leave me alone!”

There is, of course, no money to pay my dowry to the convent, and, though I pray and cry and beg God and my parents, this fact does not change. I apply to the abbess through our parish priest, but the sisters won’t take me as an oblate or a charity case. “Just as well,” my father says. “We couldn’t spare you,” my mother says. They mean, but they don’t say, that Christina is becoming yet stranger. Neighbors find her curled tight in their pigpens, crouched like an animal in ditches along the roads, hidden in the marsh grass, knee deep in stinking mud. Left alone, the sheep wander; some are recovered in the woods among the trees, some are never found at all. Trinity

The winter that Christina turns seventeen, our parents die of fever—first Father, then Mother. We’re alone now, three sisters. With our parents dead, it’s even harder to picture our futures. I still pray every day to join the convent of St. Catherine’s, but God has made it clear that He has other concerns. Gertrude is in love with Thomas, the turner’s son, but it’s uncertain whether her beauty and her share of our flock are enough inducement for any suitor to take on a lunatic for a sister-in-law. Anyway, neither of us will leave the other with Christina. Christina leans against the doorframe and watches us cry. She looks as she always does: lips colorless and peeling, neck cabled, sallow skin stretched over knobby joints. She is taller than us, big-boned, still entirely without breasts. She has blue smudges under her eyes, as if thumbs have pressed hard against the rims of her sockets. “You might be happy for our parents, Mara,” she tells me. And, though I despise her for her piety, I am abashed, because what would the sisters at St. Catherine’s say? “Of course. You’re right.” I swipe my fingers down my cheeks. “They’re with God.” “No,” Christina says. She folds her bony arms. The bridge of her nose is taut and white. When she speaks, she sounds as if she were reciting catechism. “They were disgusting. I dreamed of a wheel set high on a hill, under a golden sun. Mother was stretched naked across, and the Devil spun her, cudgelling her until her bones shattered and the marrow spilled to the dirt. Father wove her limbs in and out of the spokes.” Gertrude looks as though she might be sick. Her fist is pressed to her teeth. “They aren’t with God,” Christina says with finality. “Purgatory at best. But better there, where they can atone, than on this corrupt ground.” She looks around our home—hearth, table, loom, bed—and her mouth twists in distaste. That spring, twelve of our ewes have stillbirths. We pile the dead lambs, gleaming with amniotic fluid, their wool fine and tight-curled. I begin the work of skinning them. Her First Holy Death

Christina begins to have fits, then recovers, then has fits again. Gertrude and I learn to hold her kicking legs, to brace her head and fish for her tongue. It’s the only time that we touch her now, the only time she’ll let us. We do our best to nurse her, but she turns away from the filling stews, the thick bread slathered in butter. She seems to live on air. The fit that kills her is just like all the others, except that, when our sister finally goes still, her chest doesn’t rise and her eyes don’t shiver beneath her blue lids. Gertrude touches her hand and begins to cry. Above us, beyond the roof of our little house and the swaying treetops, far beyond the clouds and the raucous currents, Christina is already taking God’s hand, already working out the details of her journey back to life. Here on earth, curds of blood spill from her open mouth and glisten on the flagstones. How Harshly She Suffered for Those Souls Detained in Purgatory, but Remained Unharmed in Body

After Christina’s resurrection, she spends her days perched in the branches of a yew on the road to town. She shrieks at people as they pass, accusing them of their sins, which, she says, she can smell on them, can see spread across their faces like fungus. No one is spared: “You, Curate! You with your lewd nocturnal pollutions!” She screams at Gertrude and me when we bleed, screams that we are filthy, that we make her sick. “Pigs, pigs, stinking pigs,” she chants. She takes our rags from where they soak in the washtub and flings them at the walls, where they stick, dripping brown water. She herself has never menstruated. “Whore!” she hisses at Gertrude when Thomas walks her to our door. Thomas reddens and slinks away, and Gertrude watches him go with dry eyes. She never cries anymore. Christina upturns the clothes box and shreds our shifts and kirtles. “Go naked like the harlots you are!” she screams. She takes the shears to our bed linen. Straw, feathers, matted tufts of yellowed wool, are strewn across the room like some barnyard massacre. When she smashes our mother’s crockery, the fragments scatter and rock on their curves. Christina is impossible. Not possible. And yet there she is, our sister, our flesh, howling and yanking her hair out in bleeding clumps. After Gertrude and I awake to her scratching at our faces, we bind her to her bed at night. Still, she twists loose, pummels us in our bed with the rolling pin, the kettle, the peel. Above us, her face passes in and out of a shaft of moonlight, and her expression is, oddly, one of terror. Please , God , I pray, help me understand this miracle , help me understand for what purpose You have returned her to us. He has a purpose—of course He must—but in her shrill judgments I hear nothing of His Son’s love. Perhaps she’s been sent back from the afterlife to test our capacity for love, and so I try to love her, but I can’t hide my heart from God or from myself. The more I pray, the worse things become. Christina grows sick with the smell of humanity: the sweat and garlic, the stagnant mouths and fusty wool. “Please don’t come near!” she begs us, her eyes filling. Her own body revolts her, too, and she does her best to remove the offending parts. She refuses all food. She slices into the skin of her belly with a shearing blade, thrusts her hands elbow-deep into the fire until the skin blackens and blisters. She pitches herself into the wide gray Meuse, where she floats face down among chips of ice. Her arms and legs are splayed stiff, as if in rapture, and she gasps into the water. The crowds are small or they are large, but always Gertrude and I are there, calling to our sister, begging the men to drag her back to shore. All the while, I pray for her to slip from their grasp and to give herself to that sucking dark current. But she is always returned to us. Her hair dries, her wounds heal. The crowds disperse and leave the three of us alone. In a moment of calm, as Christina lies curled on the bed, eyes wide, I touch a tendril of hair at her temple, as soft as a baby’s, and she winces. I want to embrace her, crush my love into her, but I’m afraid there isn’t enough to do the trick. “Why do you hurt yourself, Christina?” I ask. “Why does God need you to hurt so much?” I have other questions, too. How will we get through this? What if this never ends? What if God doesn’t let any of us die? Later, they will say that my sister suffered for the souls in Purgatory. They will say she mortified her flesh and starved her body so that, one by one, the waiting souls might be released like bubbles into Heaven. But for now the alderman visits us, warns us to keep her in check. “Of course,” Gertrude and I say, but after he leaves we look at each other, helpless. How She Expounded with the Spirit of Prophecy “I filed for divorce on the grounds of mental exhaustion.”

Father Luc is young, with full purple lips. We knew him as a boy, when he and the other small children followed Gertrude around, begging for stories, crying to her over their scratched knees. He was in love with her then, his little red face flushing still redder when she knelt to him. Now he’s stern when Gertrude and I appear at his door, brightening only when we mention demonic possession. On the appointed day, Father Luc and the deacons and the aldermen arrive to bear Christina to the church. When they seize her, she whips her head around to us, eyes pleading, and it’s clear that she reads our betrayal in our faces. “It’s for your own good!” I call to her, my voice shaking, as Gertrude and I trail after her. “I swear, Christina, they’ll cure you!” She screams in terror, kicks in their arms, retches. In the sanctuary, Father Luc indicates the bench where we are to sit during the exorcism, but once he starts we can’t be still. Gertrude and I press against each other and the stone wall as if we might slip through it and away from what is taking place before us. Father Luc begins his chants. Now Christina is nude before these men, every part of her thrumming with fury. The fine hairs on her body catch the candlelight, outlining her in gold. We watch in hope and horror as Father Luc starts flogging the Devil out of her. Amid her ravings, Christina shrieks that the city of Jerusalem has been taken by the wicked Saracens. She says other things as well—that the Pope is a whoreson and Father Luc is a buggering goat and that I eat dung and suckle at Gertrude’s breast. But, later, Father Luc will remember only the Saracens. Her eyes roll, her fists clench, her tongue flicks in and out like a flame. Little boys crack the church door to peer in, then slam it shut in terror. And then, as the priest lifts his arm to bring down another lash, Christina meets my eye. Her face is as calm as a moon in a daytime sky. She holds my gaze, and for a moment all I can hear is the steady, tenacious ticking of her heart.

Weeks later, Father Luc visits our house, falls to his knees, thick lips trembling, and begs Christina’s forgiveness. Reports have come from across the sea. On the day of Christina’s exorcism, the Saracens stormed the Holy Land. How She Was Driven by the Spirit to Live by Begging

Events happen more quickly now. Word travels that God whispers into Christina’s ear. Priests and holy men arrive at our door, shoo Gertrude and me from the house, spend hours seeking her counsel. Christina won’t eat the food we put out for her, won’t sleep in her bed. Instead, she begs along the road. Sometimes she will eat what people offer; more often she will refuse it, waving the bread in the air, pointing at her benefactor, shouting that it is rancid with his sin. “He gives me the bowels of toads!” she cries, thrusting the loaf back at him. “Lord, why does this man torture me with his poison?” Corruption, infidelity, blasphemy. Ordinary people no longer come near us, because they fear what Christina knows and what she might accuse them of. They fear her terrible, lonely holiness. Miracle

The stories will claim that when Christina was starving, chained in a dungeon by Gertrude and me, denied food and water, sunlight and air, her virginal breasts began to flow with a liquid of clearest sweet oil, which nourished her wasted body and healed her festering wounds. I can say only that our house is not equipped with a dungeon. We own no chains. And Christina’s breasts were never more than a child’s. But, oh, the wonders Christina works. Gertrude becomes pregnant. This is a secret between the two of us and Thomas. Christina, of course, can’t know. Thomas is sweetly, shyly thrilled, eager to marry her, and so we gather in the cold church. Gertrude wears a new linen veil, a gown of fine lilac wool. Thomas stands straight beside her, in scarlet hose and marigold tunic. I am there, and Christina, and Thomas’s enormous family: smiling aunts and grandparents and cousins. They are jolly people, prosperous, well liked in the district and beyond. They now approve of the match, because, with news of Christina’s holiness spreading, what was once a liability has become an honor. Gertrude is vivid with joy, and I am, too, because after so long I am about to belong to a family again. When the bride and groom kneel before Father Luc, Christina stands. We raise our heads from our prayers to see her point at Gertrude. “Slut,” she says in a clear voice. She turns to Thomas’s family, then to Father Luc in entreaty. “She and her bastard have no place in this holy house.” Father Luc falters, wets his lips with nervousness, and looks around. Thomas takes Gertrude’s hand in both of his. “Well, can any of you say who the father is?” Christina presses. If in this moment Gertrude were to smile and shake her head, then turn back to Father Luc with an expectant expression, perhaps the ceremony might go forward, the marriage be sealed. After all, everyone in this place has heard this and worse from Christina. But instead Gertrude pulls her hand from Thomas’s and pushes herself up. He reaches for Gertrude’s hem, then withdraws. His expression is pained and uncertain. Defend yourself!, I want to call to my sister. Tears stream down her set face as if they had nothing to do with her. Thomas looks out at the rustling, murmuring congregation, at his parents’ angry expressions, and at Christina, who stands with her hands folded serenely before her. Now he rises as well, squares his shoulders. He meets Gertrude’s gaze as she watches him, waiting for his decision. His own eyes fill. “I’m sorry,” he says with a sob and leaves the church. The rest of his family files out behind him, until only the priest and we three sisters are left. Gertrude is rigid in my arms, no longer crying. Christina stands alone before the altar, tall and unsmiling, triumphant. Even Father Luc turns away from her. “Please, Gertrude,” I say, begging for something I can’t express. I press my lips against her hair. Over the next weeks and months, Gertrude becomes lush and pink with the baby, and, despite her shame, despite her grief over the loss of Thomas, she has bursts of happiness that last longer and longer as her belly grows. “I’ve always wanted a baby,” she tells me when I come in sweaty from the pasture. She pauses over her kneading to press a floury palm against the child’s kicking foot. And, because Gertrude is happy, I am happy, too. What does it matter that we’ll raise this child alone? We’re already outcasts. Then the strange thing happens. At first we don’t notice—how could we imagine it was possible? Christina begins to starve the baby out of our sister. Though Christina refuses food even more strenuously than ever, she doesn’t weaken or sicken. Instead, it is Gertrude who wastes away, despite eating the bread and honey and soft sheep’s cheese I place before her. Now she resembles Christina, all clavicle and shoulders under her dress. Her head looks big, her blond hair sparse around her face, her eyes wide and dark. Her round belly is all that’s left of her. And, as if to compensate for my sisters, I fatten until I am made up of circles: buttocks, thighs, massive barren abdomen. My skin strains to contain me. “Please!” Gertrude begs Christina. But Christina seems to have abandoned her shrieking mood. She blinks, unreadable. Gertrude holds her belly in skeletal arms. She sinks to her knees before Christina, pulls at Christina’s limp hands. “Please let me keep it,” she begs. “Please, Christina. I know you can intercede with God. Please do this for me.” Christina just gazes out over the top of Gertrude’s head. Then one day, in the eighth month, the belly drops away, too. “You’re welcome,” Christina tells Gertrude, but as she says it she looks at me and sighs deeply, happily, as if after a rich dinner. “Isn’t this what you wanted, Mara?” Gertrude says bitterly. “A life without men or children? A life apart?” How Greatly She Was Venerated

Christina is called away, first for weeks at a time, then months and years. Holy houses, noble estates: everywhere, great gates swing open to her. She stays with hermits and holy women, basking in her celebrity, prophesying famine and slaughter. Always with a taste for catastrophe, my sister. She hears the confessions of counts and noblemen and bishops. Occasionally news of Christina trickles back to us: she waters with her tears the places where men are accustomed to sin; she goes to the gallows and suspends herself among thieves; she enters the graves of dead men and there makes lamentation for the sins of men. She moves around the country with astounding freedom, travelling far beyond the Meuse Valley. Then she disappears to the mountains, to live with the recluse Iutta. With Christina gone, Gertrude and I are not enough to fill our home. That calm life I once imagined—the whir of the spinning wheel, new cloth blowing on the line, fat sheep dotting the field, our easy laughter—is impossible. We avoid each other’s eyes as we work; we speak only the barest, most essential words. Gertrude still mourns the baby, but silently, holding her grief away from me as if it were itself an infant and I a wolf. “Hi, my name is Brad and I have a beard.” My prayers won’t cohere; the words slip from my mind, and God, who once was everything, has vanished. With Christina gone, I see only my own ugliness, and my vision shrinks and aches until I can barely stand to open my eyes. This can’t last, and it doesn’t. When Gertrude tells me she is leaving to marry, I nod and say, “Of course, I understand.” But I don’t wish her well, out loud or in my heart. I don’t wish her cheerful friends, a bustling hearth, a sweet-tempered housemaid. I don’t wish her babies. When the time comes for her to pack, I wrap myself in my shawl and head out to the pasture. “Someone has to watch the sheep,” I say. But, instead of watching the sheep, I stand on the hillside overlooking the house, imagining Gertrude folding her clothes into a box, choosing from among our mother’s things. She will leave the best things for me, and even this gesture will feel like reproach. A piece of lace, a dimpled copper pot. Gertrude is to travel to Bruges in the company of the old man who will be her husband and his six grown sons. In a grand cathedral, she will say her vows before strangers. After their cart is loaded, I stand with her on the doorstep and offer her a stony kiss goodbye; although I know I will never see her again, I’m determined that she understand that in leaving she has betrayed me. The cart sets off, bearing my beloved sister away. I long to run after her, but I anchor myself against the doorjamb. Her Wondrous Song

For nine years, Christina lives with the recluse Iutta, and, when she finally returns from her holy wilderness, the nuns of St. Catherine’s make ready to welcome her. When I hear the news, I imagine them lined up in the cloisters to greet her, and, though I think that by now I am beyond envy, still my stomach clenches. Just once, when I am nearly sixty, I visit St. Catherine’s. It’s morning after a night of rain, the sky an even, bright gray, and puddles fill the yard. The place is much as I remember it—imposing and grand—but drabber, as if some gilt had been rubbed off. “What’s through there?” I ask the pale young nun who leads me from the gatehouse, pointing at an archway. I remember the green, the sunlight beyond. “There? That’s just the kitchen yard,” she says. For a moment I allow myself to imagine that I am here to present myself to the abbess. I could, I realize. Our house, our flock: they’d make a small dowry, and now they’re mine to dispose of. I’m even still a virgin. But the prospect is laughable. I can no more deliver myself to the place where my sister is venerated than I can to an unfathomable God. The nun leads me to a chill shaded room with bare floors and a few chairs. Outside, the sky must have cleared, because light leaks through the leaded windows, forming shapes on the flagstones. “Will Christina see me?” A pulse under my right eye kicks. “My sister.” Something like hostility flickers in the nun’s bland, lashless eyes, then is gone. She nods, retreats on silent feet. When she reaches the door, she turns back, and her expression twists. “The nasty lapdog.” I jerk back, stung; I don’t know what I have done, what she can possibly mean, until I realize with a leap of gladness that she’s referring to Christina. Yes!, I want to call to her. I understand! “Sister,” I say. “Sister.” I rise to follow her, my heart knocking, but she has disappeared down the corridor. A second, older nun leads Christina in by the wrist. My sister towers above the woman but is docile in her grip. She doesn’t seem to want to run, even when she sees me, and, though her habit is crooked and untidy, she appears calm. The nun delivers her to me, then drops her wrist. “Christina,” I say. I bow and move to kiss her, because she’s a holy woman and because she is my sister. Christina turns wildly to the nun. “Please don’t leave me with her!” She’s afraid of me, I realize with a pang. The old woman comes back, drops onto a chair, and watches us warily. My sister is as thin as she ever was. A blue vein is visible on her forehead. She smiles at me—suddenly, mirthlessly—and the skin pleats around her wide mouth. In a burst of motion, she flings off her wimple and veil, casts them away from her, and looks back at the attending nun in triumph. She regards me and pulls a gray strand of hair, sucks the end. “We’re both gray now,” I say. Why am I here? I’d imagined a reunion, an understanding, a making of amends. I’d imagined a calm review of the wrongs we’d done each other. I’d imagined I might forgive her. But my sister is as alien to me as she ever was. “Gertrude died,” I tell her. “I came to tell you that. She died a widow, alone. She never did have a child.” Christina holds that dreadful wordless smile, but it wavers at the corners of her lips. “Oh, Christina,” I say. “Why could we never know each other? Why has your life been so hard?” My sister doesn’t answer me, and I have to break away from her gaze. The old nun has retrieved Christina’s veil from the floor and is smoothing it in her lap. I imagine that later, after I’ve gone, she will rearrange it on Christina’s head, and my sister will be still before her, as obedient as a child. Only when I stand to leave does Christina reach out to touch me. She holds my hand in her large knob-knuckled one, draws me close gently. “When I pray,” she breathes into my ear, “I am ravished by the spirit. I whirl like a hoop.” She releases me, and then spins, habit flaring in the light at her feet, and dashes from the room. Of the Second Death of Blessed Christina and of the Translation of Her Body

Two in the morning, June 24, 1224. The hour of Matins. Christina is on her knees in her quiet cell. Three miles away, I, too, am awake. The year has the same shape it has always had, though each season comes sooner and passes more swiftly: breeding, birthing, shearing. Selling and butchering. I keep just a small flock these days, and I can manage it alone. Only now, during shearing, does the work overwhelm me, but I manage this, too, by rising early, working in the dewy dark by lamplight. Even at rest, I can’t escape the aching labor. Behind my closed eyes, the blades swish through dense wool and the tufts fall away. My forearms throb, my hand remains curled from clenching the shears. Blisters sting in the curve of my thumb. My hair is thick with lanolin, my fingers waxy. All night I pluck endless burrs from the tangles as though I were plucking souls from Purgatory. Agnus Dei . Christ is a sheep, gazing up at me with His hooded eyes and pale lashes, His long face and solemn little mouth. I drag him close to my stool, pin him between my thighs. He bleats in protest, then bows his head and submits. Everything aches: back, arms, neck, heart. I am hunched now. I turn him roughly and draw the curved blade close to his flesh, lifting a thick swath of yellow wool. Underneath, the coat is clean and white, and his skin ripples in the lamplight. He squeals when I nick him, bucks. But I yank him by the thick wool at his neck. The bright spot of red spreads like wine on linen. I grip him tighter, dig my knees into his sides, and when he shifts again the flood of light moves through me. I have a vision of my own now: in her dark cell, Christina stands from her prayers and staggers to her bed, where she is, in the words of the chroniclers, held fast in the sickness of death: she lies stretched out after the manner of corpses, and passes to the immortal age of ages. In her expression, relief. One more cut, and I free the matted wool from the sheep’s back. Quiet whorls of joy spin in my heart."

466,http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/calibris-scandalous-history,newyorker,Calibri’s Scandalous History,[],"Lucas de Groot, a Dutch typeface designer living in Berlin, recently began receiving a flood of calls and e-mails from Pakistan that, he said, “seemed very urgent.” He soon discovered that Calibri, a font he’d designed almost fifteen years earlier, was playing a central role in a corruption scandal engulfing Nawaz Sharif, the Prime Minister of Pakistan. As part of an investigation launched by the country’s Supreme Court, the Prime Minister’s daughter had released a supposedly exculpatory document signed and dated February 2, 2006. The document, however, had been printed in Calibri, which was not widely available until 2007. Investigators deemed the document to have been falsified, and the term “fontgate” began trending on Twitter.

Speaking from his office in Berlin, de Groot said that the incident “has definitely generated the most publicity for Calibri, ever.” He admitted to being a little bit happy about it. “People usually take fonts for granted,” he said.

Calibri was born in 2004, when a fellow typeface designer recruited de Groot to work on a project for “a secret client.” The client wanted a modern font that was optimized for screen reading. De Groot revised a font he’d developed seven years earlier, paying special attention to “the rhythm of the letter widths” and “the speed of the curvature.” The client turned out to be Microsoft, which, to de Groot’s astonishment, chose Calibri as the default font for its Microsoft Office suite. His payment for the font covered some office renovations, but not much else. “I am not a very good businessman,” he said.

Since 2007, Calibri has figured in several other forgery allegations. In 2012, the Turkish government accused approximately three hundred people of plotting a coup, on the basis of documents that had been printed in Calibri but were purported to date from as early as 2003. De Groot sent a form letter in response to the many inquiries he received from Pakistan. “In my opinion, the document in question was produced much later” than 2006, he wrote. While Microsoft had by then released a beta version of its Office suite that included Calibri, de Groot pointed out that only “computer nerds” and “font lovers” were using it. “Why would anyone use a completely unknown font for an official document?”

By coincidence, the font also figures in America’s ongoing Presidential scandal. One day before fontgate, Donald Trump, Jr., took to Twitter to release the e-mails he wrote while setting up a meeting between members of the Trump campaign and Russians offering dirt on Hillary Clinton. He included a short introductory note—“in order to be totally transparent, I am releasing the entire email chain of my emails”—typed in Calibri.

While most Trump critics focussed on the contents of the e-mail chain, a few zeroed in on Donald, Jr.,’s font choice. A writer for Elle ’ s Web site called Calibri “fine for a grocery list; a less ideal choice for what’s supposed to be a considered response.” One Twitter user said, “The part that angers me most is his use of Calibri font, which I hate #sad #loweffort.”

De Groot is “not a big fan” of the Trump Administration, but he defended Donald, Jr.,’s choice of Calibri, explaining that the President’s son may have been trying to tap into the font’s relatability. “Calibri is a font that everybody recognizes—a normal font,” he said. “Everybody who reads his note will realize, ‘Hey, this is the font that I’m using.’ It comes off genuine.”

De Groot dismissed the critics who attack Calibri as boring, arguing that its “neutrality” belies its underlying precision: “If you’re eating soup, you shouldn’t remember the shape of the spoon.” He listed Calibri’s virtues: it doesn’t try to mimic what already exists (“Courier is an ugly old typewriter font”); it’s stripped of old-fashioned serif embellishments (“Compared to Calibri, Times New Roman looks outdated”); and it’s playful, with its rounded corners, but not frivolous (“Comic Sans doesn’t work”).

A Pakistani journalist recently tweeted that if Prime Minister Sharif is forced out of office he should write his resignation letter using Calibri. If the Russia investigation forces Trump to resign, should the U.S. President do the same? De Groot considered. “I don’t think Calibri fits with the voice of Donald Trump, not at all,” he said. “He’s speaking so poorly, a very bold kind of speech. A resignation letter by Trump should be in black capitals—loud. You need Franklin Gothic extra bold, I think.” ♦"

They certainly compensate for the long decades when gay people projected themselves onto an art form that failed to reflect them in return. (One notable development: not all of the above operas are by gay composers.) Troublingly, though, male stories far outnumber female ones, with attendant marketing campaigns featuring buff male bodies. In the nineteen-nineties, American Opera Projects commissioned Paula Kimper to compose “Patience & Sarah,” a lesbian romance that had its première at the Lincoln Center Festival in 1998. It has had very few successors at mainstream opera houses. American music hardly lacks lesbian composers of distinction—Meredith Monk, Jennifer Higdon, Annea Lockwood, and Kristin Norderval, among others, come to mind—and they should be part of the gay-opera wave, if they are so inclined.

Even so, operas on gay themes have proliferated. Since 2010, the crop of gay-oriented works has included—flute trill, please—Jorge Martín’s “Before Night Falls” and Charles Wuorinen’s “Brokeback Mountain,” stories familiar from film; Theodore Morrison’s “Oscar,” on the life of Wilde; Terence Blanchard’s “Champion,” about the gay African-American boxer Emile Griffith; two period operas by Gregory Spears, “Paul’s Case” and “Fellow Travelers”; Mark Simpson’s “Pleasure,” set at a gay night club; Kevin March’s “Les Feluettes,” based on Michel Marc Bouchard’s play “Lilies”; Andrea Scartazzini’s “Edward II,” about the scandalous British monarch; Ricky Ian Gordon’s “27,” portraying the partnership of Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas; and Laura Kaminsky’s “As One,” a tale of transgender life. Last month, Peter Eötvös’s 2004 adaptation of Tony Kushner’s “Angels in America” was staged at New York City Opera , and Lou Harrison’s pioneering 1971 opera, “Young Caesar,” a portrait of Julius Caesar as a young bisexual, resurfaced at the Los Angeles Philharmonic.

How gay is opera? According to popular folklore, very. The culture indicated by the phrase “opera queen” became visible in pioneering openly gay communities of the late nineteenth century, and undoubtedly existed long before that. Xavier Mayne’s “The Intersexes,” a 1908 defense of homosexuality, included a self-diagnostic questionnaire—titled “Am I at All an Uranian?”—with such leading questions as “Do you prefer operatic or more abstract music . . .?” and “Are you peculiarly fond of Wagner?” Twentieth-century novels and plays show pale men and women who haunt the standing-room section at the opera and fixate upon the divas of the day. The scholar Terry Castle calls opera-queen culture “a tradition of awe, delight, and comic self-abasement as old as the opera itself.” By the nineteen-seventies and eighties, though, the venerable stereotype had receded. As Wayne Koestenbaum argues in his elegiac 1993 book, “The Queen’s Throat,” the opera queen became a signifier of a pre-Stonewall mentality—a time of “displaced eroticism,” when gay men and lesbians had to express themselves in florid codes. “After sexual liberation,” Koestenbaum asks, “who needs opera?” These days, younger gay people are far likelier to use pop music as a lingua franca. Beyoncé displaces Caballé.

The first gay character in opera is usually said to be the Countess Geschwitz, who appears in Alban Berg’s all-eclipsing masterpiece “Lulu,” unfinished at the time of the composer’s death, in 1935. Geschwitz not only declares her love for the title character but is given the final words : “Lulu! My angel! . . . I will stay near you! Into eternity!” But there were murmurs of homosexuality before that. Richard Strauss’s “Salome,” based on the Wilde play, features a male page smitten with the captain of Herod’s guard. That was 1905; four years earlier, Xavier Leroux’s now forgotten opera “Astarté” raised eyebrows in Paris. The libretto, devised by the decadent dramatist Louis de Gramont, is a fantasia on the story of Heracles’ enslavement to Queen Omphale: here, Omphale is the priestess of the Sapphic cult of Astarté, and Heracles is shown in drag, observing what appears to be a ceremonial lesbian orgy. Heracles intends to put an end to the debauchery but falls in love with Omphale instead. His only escape from this predicament is to don the fatal Shirt of Nessus, which has been dipped in centaur blood. He catches fire, and amid the ensuing conflagration Omphale escapes. The opera ends with the priestess reconstituting her Sapphic circle on the isle of Lesbos, as a chorus sings, “Glory to pleasure.” The Jahrbuch für sexuelle Zwischenstufen, the journal founded by the German gay activist Magnus Hirschfeld , took note: “ ‘Astarté’ is probably the first opera to be performed, and generally the first theatre piece, in which lesbian love is represented.”

In the twentieth century, the field of gay opera was dominated by Benjamin Britten. From “Peter Grimes” to “Billy Budd” and on to “Death in Venice,” Britten chose subjects with an oblique or obvious gay slant. Yet his obsessive scrutiny of the figure of the innocent boy has given him an uneasy place in the pantheon of gay composers. Michael Tippett, Britten’s compatriot and contemporary, ventured further in his 1970 opera, “The Knot Garden,” whose ensemble cast includes Dov, a gay white musician, and Mel, a bisexual black writer. What was audacious at the time can now seem problematic: characters in the opera are doubled with those of “The Tempest,” and Mel is cast as Caliban. But Tippett’s modern-minded sketch of same-sex love was a crucial step.

Dozens of twentieth-century American composers, from Aaron Copland and Virgil Thomson on down, were gay. Lou Harrison, whose centennial arrived in the spring , lived more openly than almost all of his contemporaries. In 1942, he told a draft board that he was homosexual, and, in a 1946 review of an edition of Tchaikovsky’s diaries, he gave a sympathetic cast to the composer’s customarily pathologized love life. With “Young Caesar,” Harrison became the first major composer to place a same-sex relationship at the heart of an opera. This was Caesar’s alleged affair with Nicomedes, King of Bithynia. Rome being Rome, the problem for Caesar’s contemporaries was not that he had bedded another man but that he had reportedly neglected to stay on top. One joke went, “ Gallias Caesar subegit, Nicomedes Caesarem ” (“Caesar conquered Gaul, Nicomedes conquered Caesar”). Caesar denied the rumors, but they stuck.

Harrison was drawn to the material not simply because of its gay content—there are more obvious stories he could have told—but also because it involved an encounter between East and West. He had long loved Indonesian gamelan music, and, in the opera, he made use of gamelan-like instruments that he and his partner, William Colvig, had constructed. Harrison was also a pacifist, and wished to show a moment in Caesar’s life when he was tempted to abandon a career of conquest. Robert Gordon, the librettist for the project, created a text with an arch, fable-like tone. Handel, one of Harrison’s favorite composers, was the model for the opera’s stately, unhurried arias.

“Young Caesar” has received few performances over the years, its progress hampered by dramatic weaknesses. Harrison revised it extensively but never solved its problems. In the L.A. Phil production, which was directed by Yuval Sharon , Harrison’s labor of love has finally achieved persuasive form. What it needed was a frame that enhanced its fairy-tale quality. Intermingling ritual and play—a cinematic ballet of animated phalluses figured in one scene—Sharon created an entertainment of trancelike grace. Caesar and Nicomedes, played affectingly by Adam Fisher and Hadleigh Adams, share tender embraces, but sexuality is almost incidental: instead, we watch a timeless scenario of a young man torn between love and ambition. There is no mention of Caesar’s bloody end, but we have the sense that he made the wrong choice.

A second wave of gay operas began in the nineteen-nineties, in the wake of the outspoken activism of ACT UP and Queer Nation. In 1995, Houston Grand Opera, which had introduced John Adams’s “Nixon in China,” staged Stewart Wallace’s “Harvey Milk,” an uneven but at times potent dramatization of Milk’s exuberant life and shocking death. In a tribute to opera-queen culture, the opera includes a scene in the standing room at the Metropolitan Opera, with a male chorus of “Tessitura. / Bel Canto. / Passaggio.”

That a composer would turn to “Angels in America,” the most imposing drama to emerge from modern gay life, seemed inevitable. Kushner knows his Wagner, and “Angels in America” fuses myth and history on a scale comparable to that of the “Ring.” Eötvös is an adroit and experienced opera composer who has set everything from Chekhov’s “Three Sisters” to Jean Genet’s “The Balcony.” In “Angels,” he deftly employs an array of avant-garde techniques to herald ecstatic visitations and hallucinatory flights. Yet Kushner’s rhetorical grandeur and mystical intensity elude him: you want a latter-day Wagner to unleash opulent orchestral gestures equal to lines like “The Great Work begins.” The good news is that the revived City Opera, at the close of its second season, put together a persuasive account of a tricky score. The production, by Sam Helfrich, was sleek and incisive; Andrew Garland and Aaron Blake, as the lovers Prior and Louis, sang with vocal allure and dramatic urgency. City Opera plans to stage a gay-themed opera each year during pride month; Wuorinen’s “Brokeback Mountain,” which the old City Opera commissioned and then set aside, is scheduled for 2018.

Of the recent gay operas I’ve seen, those that linger longest in my mind are the two by Spears. “ Paul’s Case ,” inspired by the Willa Cather story, merely hints at the sexuality of its central figure, who flees from dull reality to his doom. “Fellow Travelers,” based on Thomas Mallon’s novel, is set in the period of Cold War homophobic witch hunts; it is a tale of forbidden love without a happy ending, although neither of its lead characters meets the tragic fate common in narratives of this type. What sets these pieces apart is the intimate power of Spears’s musical voice, which is unlike that of any composer now working—a kind of shivery, fraught simplicity. Ultimately, opera hinges not on a composer’s passion for the subject but on his or her affinity with the material: there must be a sense that the story could be told no other way. Spears has an eerie ability to suggest interior landscapes that go unseen, interior lives that go unspoken. In giving us glimpses of hidden selves, his music becomes universal in reach."
468,http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trumps-tweeted-transgender-ban-is-not-a-law,newyorker,Trump’s Tweeted Transgender Ban Is Not a Law,[],"A tweet by a President is neither a law nor an executive order. That reality is important to keep in mind when considering President Trump ’s tweet on Wednesday morning, saying that the U.S. government “will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.” Trump’s tweet seemingly banning transgender people from military service has the same legal efficacy as his myriad other tweets expressing desires, promises, and intentions, many of which are unlikely to come to fruition, from building a wall on the Mexican border to changing the libel laws.

Before Trump’s tweet, the Pentagon was implementing a system of rules and regulations that allowed transgender individuals to serve in the military. An estimated two thousand to eleven thousand openly transgender active-duty service members are currently serving in the armed forces, according to a Rand Corporation study . Less than a month ago, the military was supposed to begin allowing new recruits who are transgender to join its ranks. But Defense Secretary James Mattis announced that military leaders would take six more months to study the potential impact of that move. The deferment was disappointing but it was accompanied by an assurance that the outcome of the review was not predetermined. And the delay did not, in any event, contemplate a possible outright ban on transgender individuals serving in the military.

At the same time, Congress has been debating the funding of medical treatment related to gender transition for military personnel. The Rand study estimated that the move would increase military health-care costs by between $2.4 million and $8.4 million a year, a 0.04 to 0.13 per cent increase in over-all Pentagon spending.

Trump seems to have taken military leaders by surprise on Wednesday by suddenly announcing, via tweet, a full transgender military ban. The Times reported that Mattis was on vacation and, according to people close to him, he was “appalled that Mr. Trump chose to unveil his decision in tweets, in part because of the message they sent to transgender active-duty service members, including those deployed overseas, that they were suddenly no longer welcome.”

There also appears to have been no directive from the Defense Department on which Trump based his blanket announcement, which would be remarkable in any normal Administration. The Times said it asked eight Defense Department officials how the ban would be carried out and how it would affect openly transgender active-duty members. None of the officials could give a definitive answer.

Ironically, Trump’s tweets came on the sixty-ninth anniversary of the executive order issued by President Harry Truman that desegregated the American military . Over the objections of many white officers, Truman signed Executive Order 9981, on July 26, 1948, which stated, “It is hereby declared to be the policy of the President that there shall be equality of treatment and opportunity for all persons in the armed services without regard to race, color, religion, or national origin.” Truman’s order began a decades-long, and still imperfect, effort by the military to turn itself into one of the most integrated institutions in American society.

It remains to be seen whether the Pentagon will actually adopt the transgender ban referred to in Trump’s tweet. If it does, the tendency of Trump and his aides to make public comments that turn out to be helpful to their opponents in legal battles could complicate implementation of the ban. After Trump tweeted his ban, an unnamed Administration official told Jonathan Swan of Axios that “this forces Democrats in Rust Belt states like Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin to take complete ownership of this issue. How will the blue-collar voters in these states respond when Senators up for re-election in 2018 like Debbie Stabenow are forced to make their opposition to this a key plank of their campaigns?” Statements like these could create significant problems for the Administration’s lawyers tasked with defending the lawsuits to come.

A basic and long-standing legal principle is that government actions must have a “rational basis,” which is the lowest level of Constitutional scrutiny. Basing a government policy on an urgent need to win midterm elections would not satisfy such a requirement. It is debasing that we spend so much energy in reaction to a President whose erratic, hundred-and-forty-character statements, unfortunately, often seem to embody no rational basis at all."

The New Yorker’s Lizzie Widdicombe and the radio producer Steven Valentino travel to Palm Beach to speak with self-styled Democratic resisters by the pool and attend a benefit at Mar-a-Lago, where they sample Trump wine and wait for the President to show."

But if you read it from the perspective of the Russians trying to gain a toehold—or more—inside the Trump campaign, you realize how easy he made it for them. As the evidence mounted last year that the Russian government launched an unprecedented hacking and influence campaign to affect the 2016 election in Donald Trump’s favor, the Trump team, including Kushner, became increasingly more solicitous to high-level Russians offering information and requesting meetings.

Kushner’s first meeting with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian Ambassador to the United States, seems relatively innocuous. According to Kushner’s account, they met in April, 2016, at the Mayflower Hotel, in Washington, D.C., during a reception before a speech that Trump delivered on foreign policy. Dimitri Simes, the publisher of The National Interest and the organizer of the event, introduced Kushner to Kislyak and three other ambassadors. To Kushner, the introduction was forgettable. Without specifying which ones, he noted that some of the ambassadors invited him to lunch but that he “never took them up on any of these invitations.”

For Kislyak, it was clearly an important moment. The Russian Ambassador represents a country whose intelligence services had hacked their way into the Democratic National Committee’s networks ten months earlier and hacked the e-mail account of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, the previous month. At Trump’s speech, Kislyak was honored with an invitation to the reception and a front-row seat . Trump’s speech itself extended an olive branch to Vladimir Putin, calling for “improved relations with Russia” and an effort to “make a deal that’s great” for “America, but also good for Russia.”

By May, Russia’s General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate—the G.R.U.—“had exfiltrated large volumes of data from the DNC,” according to the U.S. intelligence community’s unclassified report on Russian meddling. In June, the Russian government adopted “a clear preference” for Trump, according to the report. “Beginning in June, Putin’s public comments about the U.S. presidential race avoided directly praising President-elect Trump, probably because Kremlin officials thought that any praise from Putin personally would backfire in the United States. Nonetheless, Putin publicly indicated a preference for President-elect Trump’s stated policy to work with Russia, and pro-Kremlin figures spoke highly about what they saw as his Russia-friendly positions on Syria and Ukraine.”

That same month, Russian associates of the Trump family reached out to offer the Trump campaign some direct assistance. On June 3rd, Rob Goldstone , a British music publicist and former tabloid journalist, e-mailed Donald Trump, Jr., offering “some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,” and noted that the offer was “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” A meeting was set for June 9th , and Trump’s oldest child forwarded the full e-mail exchange to Kushner and Paul Manafort, who at the time was the campaign chairman. The subject line was “Russia - Clinton - private and confidential.”

Yesterday, Kushner insisted, “I did not read or recall this e-mail exchange before it was shown to me by my lawyers.” Whether or not that’s true, he attended the meeting. According to Kushner’s account of the meeting, it was uneventful. He got there late, some Russians he never heard of were discussing adoption policy, and he quickly messaged his assistant to call him so he had an excuse to bail. Longtime intelligence officials have a more jaundiced view. Michael Hayden, the former head of the Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency, told me that he was convinced the meeting was a classic “soft approach” by Russian intelligence. He cited a recent Washington Post article , by Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, that argued that the meeting “is in line with what intelligence analysts would expect an overture in a Russian influence operation to look like,” and that it may have been the “green light Russia was looking for to launch a more aggressive phase of intervention in the U.S. election.”

Hayden told me, “My god, this is just such traditional tradecraft.” He said that he has talked to people in the intelligence community about Mowatt-Larssen’s theory and that “every case officer I’ve pushed on this” agreed with it. “This is how they do it.”

Hayden explained that the Russians would have learned several things from the approach. “Would they take the meeting?” he said. “So, then you get the willingness. No. 2, would they report the meeting?” Hayden suggested that Russian intelligence was sophisticated enough to know whether the Trump campaign reported the meeting to the F.B.I., which it didn’t. So, while Kushner claimed that the meeting was irrelevant, from a Russian intelligence perspective it would have been seen as a clear signal. “At the end, they have established that these guys are willing,” Hayden said, pausing. “How do I put this? They did not reject a relationship.”

The intelligence community’s report makes a similar point, noting, “Russian influence campaigns are multifaceted and designed to be deniable because they use a mix of agents of influence, cutouts, front organizations, and false-flag operations.”

On July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks published its first batch of e-mails stolen from the D.N.C., and revelations contained in the e-mails became a favorite topic for the Trump campaign throughout the summer and fall. On October 4th, after a lengthy internal debate, the Obama Administration finally went public with its accusations about Russia’s meddling. “The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations,” a joint statement by the Department of Homeland Security and the director of National Intelligence that was posted at 3:30 P.M. said. One hour later, Podesta’s e-mails were released by WikiLeaks. (It was an eventful day : in between, at about 4 P.M. , the infamous “ Access Hollywood ” tape was also released.)

The Trump campaign was more interested in the release from WikiLeaks than the release from the intelligence community. “This just came out—WikiLeaks!” Trump exclaimed at a rally on October 10, 2016, in Pennsylvania, promoting the latest disclosures. “I love WikiLeaks!” Trump, according to one count , mentioned the group or the leaked e-mails a hundred and sixty-four times in the last thirty days of the campaign.

Eric Swalwell, a Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told me that one of the key questions that congressional investigators have for Kushner is why he ignored the intelligence community’s warnings about Russia. “Once it became public that they were interfering in our election, which was in June, why did you continue to have contacts with them?” Swalwell, whose committee interviewed Kushner on Tuesday morning, said. “They don’t discuss at all, like, ‘Hey, Russia is interfering in our election. Should we talk to them about that?’ ”

In fact, Kushner never raised Russia’s meddling during his two post-election meetings with Russians, according to his own accounts. Kislyak contacted Kushner on November 16th, and they met on December 1st. Once again, the Russians seemed to have a level of access to the Trump campaign that other countries, including Western allies, could only dream of. In his testimony, Kushner confirmed that at this meeting, which took place in Trump Tower, he and Kislyak and Michael Flynn, the incoming national-security adviser, who also attended, discussed using communications equipment at the Russian Embassy. Kushner said the purpose was to relay information from Russian generals about Syria.

There was no skepticism about Russia or its actions in recent years from Kushner. But Kislyak was representing a leader who, as John Brennan, the former C.I.A. director, recently noted , “assaulted one of the foundational pillars of our democracy, our electoral system, that invaded Ukraine, annexed Crimea, that has suppressed and repressed political opponents in Russia and has caused the deaths of many of them.”

The Kushner-Kislyak relationship continued. On December 13th, at Kislyak’s urging, Kushner met with Sergey Gorkov, a Russian banker who is close to Putin. Again, what jumps out from Kushner’s account of the meeting is the easy access that the Russians had—“I agreed to meet Mr. Gorkov because the Ambassador has been so insistent,” and “said he had a direct relationship with” Putin, Kushner noted—and the obvious attempts to soften up Trump’ s closest aides and family members. Gorkov, whose bank, Vnesheconombank, was affected by the Obama Administration’s sanctions against Russia, brought Kushner a piece of art and a bag of dirt from Nvgorod, Belarus, where Kushner’s grandparents are from. Kushner insists that there were no real policies discussed at the meeting, which he said lasted less than a half hour.

As with his accounts of all the other interactions with Russians, Kushner claims he was simply a naïve staffer exchanging benign pleasantries. His professed innocence about the nature of these contacts may be the most troubling part of his testimony. The Russians were running a complex—and seemingly successful—campaign to gain access to Trump’s orbit, and the President-elect’s most trusted adviser claims he was clueless about what was actually going on. Kushner’s testimony does not reveal evidence of any crimes, but it does reveal a campaign and Presidential transition that were remarkably easy targets for Russian intelligence efforts.

“The Russians clearly thought they had reasons to believe this would be a friendly audience,” Hayden said. “If you’ve never seen a major-league curveball, you shouldn’t pretend you’re a major-leaguer.”"
471,http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/from-the-mixed-up-files-of-mrs-basil-e-frankweiler-fifty-years-later,newyorker,"“From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler,” Fifty Years Later",[],"The first paragraph of E. L. Konigsburg’s 1967 book “ From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler ,” about two young runaways who become entangled in an art-historical mystery, is a masterpiece of graceful, efficient exposition:

Claudia knew that she could never pull off the old-fashioned kind of running away. That is, running away in the heat of anger with a knapsack on her back. She didn’t like discomfort; even picnics were untidy and inconvenient: all those insects and the sun melting the icing on the cupcakes. Therefore, she decided that her leaving home would not be just running from somewhere but would be running to somewhere. To a large place, a comfortable place, an indoor place, and preferably a beautiful place. And that’s why she decided upon the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

After just six sentences, the reader knows Claudia intimately, and is ready to go to the Met.

On Saturday, that’s where I went. The Met was offering two dedicated tours in honor of Konigsburg’s beloved book, which turns fifty this year. The hour-long trek, advertised for kids aged seven to eleven, was free with museum admission and first come, first served. (There were also “Mixed-Up Files”-themed cookies at the café in the American Wing, and a selfie station for recreating the book cover, which Claudia, no doubt, would have regarded as gauche.) Around 1:30 P.M. , having obtained clearance to attend the second tour as an unaccompanied adult, I walked up the museum steps, wading through strollers and selfie sticks. In the “Mixed-Up Files,” Claudia and her brother Jamie—chosen as her travelling companion because of the twenty-four-dollar fortune he’s amassed by cheating at cards—take a train from Connecticut to Grand Central Terminal and walk all the way uptown. As they approach the perpetual hubbub outside the museum, Jamie becomes convinced of the wisdom of Claudia’s plan. “I think you’re brilliant, Claude. New York is a great place to hide out. No one notices no one,” he says. (Despite the compliment, his sister corrects his grammar immediately; both Claudia’s pedantry and her pathological independence insured that the young me would deeply identify with her.)

Claudia and Jamie spend a week hiding in the Met, scattering their possessions among various urns and sarcophagi, crouching on top of toilets when the guards patrol at night. Their caper can’t be perfectly retraced anymore: the chapel where they say a desultory prayer was closed, in 2001, and the ornate canopy bed that Claudia slept in has been dismantled, to many a visitor’s chagrin . On Saturday, our tour guide distributed a handout comparing the museum’s floor plan in the nineteen-sixties, which appears across two pages in Konigsburg’s book, to the expanded floor plan today. Undeterred, we walked through the Greek and Roman galleries and sat down in front of the ancient sarcophagus in which Claudia hides her violin case.

We were sitting, the guide explained, in a hall that was, when Konigsburg wrote her book, a restaurant, with tables surrounding a large central pool. Inside the pool was a bronze sculpture of whimsical dancing figures—the “Fountain of the Muses,” which was sculpted by Carl Milles and now resides outdoors, in South Carolina. In the “Mixed-Up Files,” Claudia and Jamie take baths in the pool one night. Our guide read from the scene, in which Claudia and Jamie climb “under the velvet rope that meant that the restaurant was closed to the public. Of course they were not the public.” It’s a delightful scene, combining the pleasures of being naked in public, of unexpectedly profiting—as Claudia scrubs herself down with the powdered soap she’s been hoarding from the public restroom, Jamie discovers the trove of wishing coins on the floor of the pool—and, above all, of getting away with something, which remains the underlying thrill of the book.

Elaine Lobl Konigsburg was an unpublished stay-at-home mother of three when she started working on the “Mixed-Up Files.” (She would eventually write twenty-one books and win two Newbery Medals, for the “Mixed-Up Files” and for the brilliant “ The View from Saturday ,” published in 1996.) Back then, on Saturdays, she would take the train down from Port Chester for art lessons and drop her kids off at the Met. She’d meet them at the museum afterward. One day, as they were walking through a gallery of French furniture, she saw, behind a velvet rope, a single piece of popcorn on a blue silk chair. When Konigsburg died, in 2013, the Metropolitan Museum of Art hosted a private event in her remembrance, and her son Paul recalled his mother wondering aloud about that piece of popcorn. The moment was “ burned into shrapnel memory ” for her, he said, and it provided the kernel, so to speak, of the whole book.

There were other real-life inspirations for the “Mixed-Up Files.” The book features a small angel statue, possibly sculpted by Michelangelo, that attracts huge lines of museumgoers each day. Konigsburg took her inspiration for the crowds from the 1963 visit of the “Mona Lisa” to the museum, which drew a million people in three and a half weeks, and her inspiration for the object from an article she’d read in the Times about a statue that the museum had acquired at auction, for two hundred and twenty-five dollars, from the estate of a woman named Mrs. A. Hamilton Rice. In the book, Claudia and Jamie become amateur art historians, investigating the provenance of this piece; Claudia, in particular, becomes obsessed with the statue. (In real life, curators eventually concluded that the sculptor wasn’t Michelangelo; Konigsburg gives her characters a happier ending.) On Saturday, our tour guide sat the kids down in front of a Michelangelo statue of Cupid and asked if there were any ten-year-olds in the crowd. Hands shot up. Eleven-year-olds? There were a few. “Well, Michelangelo was just fifteen when he sculpted this statue,” she said. The kids looked universally dismayed.

On the train home, I reread the thirty-fifth-anniversary edition of the “Mixed-Up Files,” which I had picked up at the museum gift shop. It was even better than I remembered. It’s very sophisticated, with the deep story unfolding subtly under the narrative surface. In a short, mysterious prologue, Konigsburg’s wry narrator announces herself as Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, and then drops clues about the story in parenthetical asides, addressed to her lawyer, which begin on the third page: “(Since you always drive to the city, Saxonberg, you probably don’t know the cost of train fare. I’ll tell you. . . .)” In one of these asides, she suddenly tightens the loop for the reader—“(And that, Saxonberg, is how I enter the story. Claudia and Jamie Kincaid came to see me about Angel.)”

The Q train kept stopping. I was struck by how tenderly Konigsburg wrote Claudia and Jamie—readers will remember the pleasure and financial anxiety of each meal they take at the Automat—and by the humor she found in their voices. Claudia’s main reason for running away is, vaguely, “injustice,” and when the narration shifts to Jamie’s perspective Konigsburg uses “sculpture” as a verb. But there is no sentimentality in the book. The kids aren’t homesick for their parents, they don’t romanticize the museum, and there’s not a hint of moral instruction throughout the whole thing. They do have their adventures: at one point, they rent a post-office box and send the Met an anonymous letter, which they type on a display Olivetti that’s sitting out on Fifth Avenue; they even get a reply. But, as Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler tells Claudia, the real adventure is coming home with a secret. “Secrets are the kind of adventure she needs,” Frankweiler says. It’s an adult conclusion, complicated and true.

I got off the train and kept reading as I walked, the way I used to when I was a kid. I banged into a bus stop on Myrtle Avenue and flinched when tree leaves brushed my cheek. Somehow, I reached the last page just as I got to my stoop. Museum guards had discovered a violin case and a trumpet case and sent these odd objects to lost-and-found. “They are still there,” Konigsburg writes. “Full of gray-washed underwear and a cheap transistor radio. No one has claimed them yet.”"
472,http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/10/01/mugglemarch,newyorker,J. K. Rowling’s Novel for Adults,[],"The conifer hedges in front of J. K. Rowling’s seventeenth-century house, in Edinburgh, are about twenty feet tall. They reach higher than the street lamps in front of them, and evoke the entrance to the spiteful maze in the film adaptation of “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,” the fourth volume of her fantasy series. Rowling, who, at forty-seven, is about to publish her first novel for adults—it is set in a contemporary Britain familiar with Jay-Z and online pornography, but is shaded with memories of her own, quite cheerless upbringing—lives here with her second husband, Neil Murray, a doctor, and their children. She has a reputation for reserve: for being likable but shy and thin-skinned, and not at all comfortable with the personal impact of having created a modern myth, sold four hundred and fifty million books, and inspired more than six hundred thousand pieces of Harry Potter fan fiction, a total that increases by at least a thousand stories a week. Ian Rankin, the writer of Edinburgh-based crime novels, became friendly with Joanne Rowling when they were neighbors in another part of the city; he recently described her as “quite quiet, quite introspective.” He recalled urging Rowling to join him for an onstage interview at the Edinburgh International Book Festival, a few years ago. After Rowling watched Rankin being interviewed at a similar event, she told him, “I don’t think I can do that.” Rankin said, “I think she feels uncomfortable in a room full of adults. I’ve seen her in a room of kids, and she’s in her element.” Rankin noted that Rowling, in her writing, retains “the power of life and death over these characters.” She is wary “of situations you can’t always control—in the real world.” In the spring, nearly five years after the appearance of the seventh, and final, Harry Potter novel, Little, Brown, Rowling’s publisher, announced “The Casual Vacancy,” and offered a glimpse of the plot: an idyllic English town named Pagford; the death of a man named Barry; a parish-council election. In response, a British publisher announced “The Vacant Casualty,” billed as a parody, if one can parody something whose contents are unknown. Commenters on the Guardian ’ s Web site guessed at Rowling’s likely models, with reference to Robertson Davies and “Desperate Housewives.” One reader, playing on Rowling’s word for non-wizard society, suggested an alternate title: “Mugglemarch.” And the hosts of Pottercast, a popular American fan podcast, picked over the press release, registering both delight at fresh data—Rowling has written ten tweets in three years—and a hint of worry that an extraordinary global bond between an author and her readers, and between two generations, was about to be severed. They were opening an invitation to a party where they might not be quite welcome. During the podcast, they looked up “parish council” on Wikipedia, and established that the term refers to the lowest rung of English local government. One of the hosts, Melissa Anelli—a thirty-two-year-old who runs a Potter Web site, stages an annual Potter convention, and has published a sharp-witted book about Potter enthusiasts—pondered the title, asking, “What’s casual, ever, about a vacancy?” She and her co-hosts wondered whether they’d go to a midnight party to celebrate the book’s launch, as many fans had for the later Potter novels. In Britain, Ian Rankin typically publishes a new novel in October, and it tends to go to the top of the best-seller list. He said that, this year, his publisher moved the date to November, fearing that the late-September launch of “The Casual Vacancy” will, for weeks, render all other fiction invisible to readers and to the media. Rankin was taken aback but glad for the extra writing time. He wondered if “The Casual Vacancy” might have a whodunnit air; Rowling has talked to him of her admiration for British crime writing of the nineteen-twenties and thirties. “She loves Margery Allingham and Dorothy L. Sayers,” he said, adding that the Pagford setting had relieved him of his greatest fear: that Rowling had been working on a crime novel set in Edinburgh. He said, “I hope she’ll create an English village that she will know intimately—and it will be real to us.”

“I have drawn a map of Pagford,” Rowling told me when we met, in late August. “It’s one of the first things I did.” We were not speaking in her Edinburgh house, or at her country place—which stands in grassland, overlooking a fast-running river in a valley north of the city—or in her home in an expensive part of west London. We were at her office, which occupies an unmarked Georgian building on a handsome street in central Edinburgh, not too far from a café that, in mockery of competitors, has hung a sign that reads “ J. K. ROWLING NEVER WROTE HERE. ” The office has high ceilings, Turkish rugs over wooden floors, figurative oil paintings by modern Scottish artists, and the air of a small but very well-funded embassy. According to the London Sunday Times , Rowling is worth nine hundred million dollars. An assistant had shown me to a front room on the parlor floor. Rowling was sitting at the head of a polished table, with a cup of black coffee and a newspaper; as I entered, she took off large black-framed glasses. She was slight, with her blond hair pulled back, and her V-necked sweater was pushed up at the sleeves to show freckled arms. She appeared to be wearing false eyelashes and rather heavy foundation. We talked at that table, and—after a brief, rainy walk—in the lounge of a nearby hotel. There was a stiffness to the transaction, but she was not unfriendly; she laughed now and then, and was clearly pleased to be able to talk about her book. It had been fourteen years, she calculated, since she’d been interviewed by someone who’d read the imminent novel. Once the Potter series had taken off, her representatives kept unflinching watch over Rowling’s words, in order to enhance the drama of synchronized international releases, and to help suppress piracy. (It was in this context that, in 2005, a British security guard who had stolen two copies of “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince” from a book-distribution center fired a gun during negotiations to sell a copy to a reporter from the Sun .) Her writing life was oddly self-contained, even if, by the end of the Potter series, she was receiving between one and two thousand pieces of mail a week. Rowling does not widely distribute her unpublished manuscripts, and her publishers seem to have processed them with little intervention. (Neil Blair, her agent, told me, “She takes a lot of time getting it right and then hands in a book that doesn’t need much editing.”) A few years ago, in a conversation with Melissa Anelli, the podcast host, Rowling criticized herself for not quite finishing “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.” “I didn’t do the final edit that I normally do before I hand it to the editors, and it definitely shows,” she said, sounding almost like a self-published author. In 2007, more than twenty-five million copies of “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows” were printed, in the first edition, and Rowling estimated that only seven people in the world, including her British agent and her editors in New York and London, had read the novel before stores began selling it. I asked her if publishing the new book made her feel exposed. “I thought I’d feel frightened at this point,” she said. “Not just because it’s been five years, and anything I wrote after Potter— anything —was going to receive a certain degree of attention that is not entirely welcome, if I’m honest. It’s not the place I’m happiest or most comfortable, shall we say. So, for the first few years of writing ‘The Casual Vacancy,’ I kept saying to myself, ‘You’re very lucky. You can pay your bills, you don’t have to publish it.’ And that was a very freeing thought, even though I knew bloody well, in my heart of hearts, that I was going to publish it. I knew that a writer generally writes to be read, unless you’re Salinger.” After all the fretting—“Christ, you’re going to have to go out there again”—she discovered that she was calm. “I think I’ve spent so long with the book—it is what I want it to be,” she said. “You think, Well, I did the best I could where I was with what I had.” She laughed. “Which is a terrible paraphrase of a Theodore Roosevelt quote.” In the decade or so after A. A. Milne published the “Winnie-the-Pooh” books, in the nineteen-twenties, he wrote several plays and novels for adults, as well as an autobiography in which he expanded on a thought expressed by a character in an Arnold Bennett play: that the artist who has early success with a painting of a policeman is expected to paint policemen forever. Milne wrote, “If you stop painting policemen in order to paint windmills, criticism remains so overpoweringly policeman-conscious that even a windmill is seen as something with arms out, obviously directing the traffic.” He added, “As a discerning critic pointed out: the hero of my latest play, God help it, was ‘just Christopher Robin grown up.’ So that even when I stop writing about children, I still insist on writing about people who were children once.” I read “The Casual Vacancy,” which is five hundred and twelve pages long, in the New York offices of Little, Brown, after signing a non-disclosure agreement whose first draft—later revised—had prohibited me from taking notes. (With this book, Rowling was hoping for a “more run-of-the-mill publishing experience,” but that hope goes only so far.) Within a few pages, it was clear that the novel had not been written for children: “The leathery skin of her upper cleavage radiated little cracks that no longer vanished when decompressed.” A little later, a lustful boy sits on a school bus “with an ache in his heart and in his balls.” But reviewers looking for echoes of the Harry Potter series will find them. “The Casual Vacancy” describes young people coming of age in a place divided by warring factions, and the deceased council member, Barry Fairbrother—who dies in the first chapter but remains the story’s moral center—had the same virtues, in his world, that Harry had in his: tolerance, constancy, a willingness to act. “I think there is a through-line,” Rowling said. “Mortality, morality, the two things that I obsess about.” “The Casual Vacancy” is not a whodunnit but, rather, a rural comedy of manners that, having taken on state-of-the-nation social themes, builds into black melodrama. Its attention rotates among several Pagford households, in the Southwest of England: a gourmet-grocery owner and his wife; two doctors; a nurse married to a printer; a social worker. Most of the families include troubled teens. Barry’s civic influence is revealed by his departure, rather as George Bailey’s is in “It’s a Wonderful Life.” The story is driven by the long-standing frustration that some of Barry’s disagreeable and right-wing neighbors have about the town’s administrative connection to the Fields, an area of public housing and poverty on the edge of a larger, nearby town. Historically, children from the Fields have had the right to attend primary school in Pagford, a place of flower baskets and other middle-class comforts, and the town has also supported a drug-treatment clinic that serves the neighborhood. In the absence of Barry’s righteous influence, the anti-Fields faction sees an opportunity to rid Pagford of this burden. This is a story of class warfare set amid semi-rural poverty, heroin addiction, and teen-age perplexity and sexuality. It may be a while before we’re accustomed to reading phrases like “that miraculously unguarded vagina” in a Rowling book, and public response to “The Casual Vacancy” will doubtless include scandalized objections to the idea of young Harry Potter readers being drawn into such material. “There is no part of me that feels that I represented myself as your children’s babysitter or their teacher,” Rowling said. “I was always, I think, completely honest. I’m a writer, and I will write what I want to write.” She was ready for a change of genre. “I had a lot of real-world material in me, believe you me,” Rowling said. “The thing about fantasy—there are certain things you just don’t do in fantasy. You don’t have sex near unicorns. It’s an ironclad rule. It’s tacky.” She then added, carefully, “It’s not that I just wanted to write about people having sex.” Rather, she began with the idea of writing about a local election, which gave her a “rush of adrenaline.” The Harry Potter series had an alluring creation story, known to all fans: in 1990, on a delayed train between Manchester and London, Rowling was overwhelmed by the thought of a boy who learns, at the age of eleven, that he is a wizard. The idea for “The Casual Vacancy” also came to Rowling while she was travelling, but this time she was on a private plane, touring America to promote “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.” “It’s been billed, slightly, as a black comedy, but to me it’s more of a comic tragedy,” she said. If the novel had precedents, “it would be sort of nineteenth-century: the anatomy and the analysis of a very small and closed society.” A local election was “a perfect way in,” she said. “It’s the smallest possible building block of democracy—this tiny atom on which everything rests.” One could say that national politics does not rest upon local politics, and that no modern British town is a closed society; some of Rowling’s characters may seem eccentric for the earnestness with which they regard a local election. She acknowledged that the scale of parish-council decision-making is “easy to laugh at” but said that “part of the point is that those decisions that are being made do dramatically affect people’s lives, up to life and death sometimes.” She said, “In my head, the working title for a long time was ‘Responsible,’ because for me this is a book about responsibility. In the minor sense—how responsible we are for our own personal happiness, and where we find ourselves in life—but in the macro sense also, of course: how responsible we are for the poor, the disadvantaged, other people’s misery.” Two years in, she picked up the standard British handbook for local administrators. “I needed it to check certain abstruse points. And in there I came across the phrase ‘a casual vacancy.’ Meaning, when a seat falls vacant through death or scandal. And immediately I knew that that was the title. . . . I was dealing not only with responsibility but with a bunch of characters who all have these little vacancies in their lives, these emptinesses in their lives, that they’re all filling in various ways.” She added, with some passion, “And it’s death! The casual vacancy, the casualness with which death comes down. You expect a fanfare, you expect some sort of pathos or grandeur to it. And, you know, the first big death I ever suffered was my mother’s, and it was that that was so shocking: just gone.”

Rowling is not a recluse: she read at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics; she was Harvard’s commencement speaker in 2008; she appeared in a television documentary about her family tree. But she is not a part of everyday British cultural life. (“I’m not a natural joiner,” she told me.) Her nonfiction canon adds up to just a few thousand words, and includes a single book review—she praised the letters of Jessica Mitford, the British writer and left-wing activist, for whom Rowling’s older daughter is named—and a short essay in a collection of speeches by Gordon Brown, the former Labour Prime Minister, whom she admires, and whose wife, Sarah Brown, is a friend. She has given limited access to her personal history, and in interviews has tended to strike the same few notes: a friend in her teen-age years who freed the two of them by having access to a Ford Anglia, the same car driven by Ron Weasley, Harry Potter’s friend; the train ride that delivered Harry to her; a difficult period, in the nineties, as a single mother. Last year, Lifetime constructed a biopic out of these fragments, filling the gaps with surreally misjudged approximations of a middle-class West Country childhood in the sixties and seventies: in the film, Rowling’s secondary school has exposed timber beams, and people say “I love you” at the end of phone calls. Rowling’s father was an engineer at the Rolls-Royce aircraft-engine plant in Bristol, and Rowling and her younger sister, Dianne, spent their earliest years in villages just outside that city, which is two hours west of London. When Joanne was nine, the family moved a little farther west, to the edge of the Forest of Dean, a more rural and less prosperous district. Neither of Rowling’s parents went to college, but her mother’s family was solidly middle class and educated; Joanne’s great-aunt Ivy was a classics teacher, and she introduced Joanne to Mitford’s writing. The Rowlings now lived in a handsome Gothic Revival cottage, by a church, in the village of Tutshill. “My voice wasn’t Forest of Dean, although it became Forest of Dean, believe you me, pretty damn quickly,” Rowling said. Her accent is still subtly flexible, and at one point in our conversation she exclaimed like a Scot: “Och!” She said that, after the family’s twenty-mile move, “I always felt an outsider.” There’s a resentfully uprooted teen-age Londoner in “The Casual Vacancy,” and Rowling volunteered that this is a partial self-portrait. Unlike other members of her family, Rowling regularly attended services in the church next door. At eleven, she enrolled at Wyedean, a new secondary school. Her mother—a woman of French and Scottish heritage with a smile that was slightly skewed, like her daughter’s—later worked in the school, as a technician in the science department. Steve Eddy, who taught Rowling English when she first arrived, and has since become a writer with an interest in mythology and astrology, remembers Joanne as “not exceptional” but “one of a group of girls who were bright, and quite good at English.” Referring to Harry Potter’s bookish friend, he said, “I suppose you could say she was a bit Hermione-like. I’d ask a question, and some hands would shoot up, and she was definitely one of the group.” He recalled that the class read Stan Barstow’s “Joby”—a realist story about a working-class Northern boy—as well as “The Weirdstone of Brisingamen,” by Alan Garner (a wizard, dwarfs, witches), and “A Wizard of Earthsea,” by Ursula K. Le Guin, whose hero attends a school for wizards. Eddy said that Rowling, when writing stories, was much more likely than other students to produce fantasy. At the time, she had little taste for realism. Several of the key characters in “The Casual Vacancy” are in their mid-teens, and the novel seems most comfortable when it’s with them. This is partly a question of grouping and movement; these are the novel’s tracking shots, when it can follow children on bus rides, on bicycles, and along school corridors; their parents, understandably, are less dynamic. But Rowling also seems profoundly connected to her own teen-age self. (“What does that say about my arrested development, I wonder?” she asked.) One well-observed and recurring motif is the teen-age instinct to adopt, and find comfort in, the families of others—just as Harry Potter adopted the Weasleys. Rowling referred to Jessica, her daughter from her first marriage, who is now a college student but who, until recently, was in a group of friends who moved “from house to house, all of them being charming to everyone else’s parents.” Rowling said that she “hated” being a teen-ager, but then criticized herself for exaggeration, and started again: “I wasn’t particularly happy. I think it’s a dreadful time of life.” She added, “I came from a difficult family. My mother was very ill, and it wasn’t the easiest.” In 1980, when Rowling was fifteen, her mother was given a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. She died a decade later, at forty-five. Rowling has occasionally talked publicly about her grief, and her regret that her mother never knew of her writing career. (Among other philanthropic activities, Rowling founded the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic, at the University of Edinburgh, with a gift of sixteen million dollars.) When Rowling filmed a touching episode of “Who Do You Think You Are?,” the genealogical TV series, the research was all on the maternal line, with particular attention to her French great-grandfather, Louis Volant. The program showed Rowling’s distress at learning that he had not been awarded a Légion d’Honneur, as family lore had it; she had repeated the claim in a 2009 speech, upon receiving her own Légion d’Honneur. And it revealed her pride on discovering that Volant had been awarded a Croix de Guerre, for bravery, in the First World War. “My children have very little sense of my side of the family,” Rowling told me. “I married someone who’s got a vast Scottish family—a clan, really—which is fabulous, and I love it, and I love them, but I wanted to have something I could show my children and say, ‘Look, I also have a family, I also have a background.’ Because there are very few people alive on my mother’s side of the family. I have a sister, that’s clearly very important, but above us nearly everyone’s gone.” That show didn’t mention Rowling’s father, Peter. One of the more interesting characters in “The Casual Vacancy” is Andrew, a restless teen-ager with an abusive, belittling father. “Andrew’s romantic idea that he’ll go and live among the graffiti and broken windows of London—that was me,” Rowling said. “I thought, I have to get away from this place. So all of my energies went into that.” She has previously said that her father frightened her. When I asked her about him, Rowling said, “I did not have an easy relationship with my father, but no one in ‘The Casual Vacancy’ is a portrait of any living person.” I asked if she was writing from experience when Andrew, having done harm to his father, then seeks to make peace with him. “To a degree,” she said. “If you’ve ever been there, if you’ve ever been in a difficult and complex family situation, you will understand. I suppose, to an extent, it’s like Stockholm syndrome, isn’t it? You have to make friends with the warders—this is a matter of survival. And Andrew, having dealt his father this body blow, then turns around and feels it’s time to make an alliance. I think that’s psychologically accurate. Some won’t.” “O.K., maybe that was inelegantly stated.” Her father remarried two years after Anne Rowling’s death. He attended Joanne’s wedding to Neil Murray, in 2001, in Scotland, but they stopped speaking about two years later. “We’ve not had any communication for about nine years,” Rowling told me. She said that the break had already happened when, in December, 2003, Peter Rowling offered his Harry Potter first editions for sale, at Sotheby’s; some of them did not sell, but others did, including a copy of “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,” given to him on Father’s Day, 2000, and signed, “Lots of love from your first born,” with a drawing of a hand reaching for a running gnome. It went for forty-eight thousand dollars. Despite Rowling’s difficult home life, she did well at Wyedean, where only a minority of students went on to college. But she downplayed the achievement of having been head girl, an appointment by school authorities. It meant, she said, “We have caught you once smoking at a bus shelter, and we think you probably won’t go to Borstal”—juvenile detention. (Steve Eddy, the teacher, doesn’t recall the school being so rough.) In 1982, she took the entrance exams for Oxford but was not accepted, and instead studied French at Exeter, a university with a reputation for being “frantically posh,” as Rowling put it. She was suddenly among privately educated girls, in pearls and turned-up shirt collars. Paraphrasing Fitzgerald, she said that she reacted to Exeter “not with the rage of the revolutionary but the smoldering hatred of the peasant.” (There’s some of this spirit in Rowling’s acidic portrait of the haughty youth of Slytherin House, at Hogwarts, Harry Potter’s school.) Martin Sorrell, then a professor of French at the university, recalled a quietly competent student, with a denim jacket and dark hair, who, in academic terms, “gave the appearance of doing what was necessary.” Her own memory is that she did “no work whatsoever.” She wore heavy eyeliner, listened to the Smiths, and read Dickens and Tolkien. In retrospect, she thinks it was fortunate that she didn’t get into Oxford: “I was intimidated enough by Exeter. Imagine—I would have fallen apart at Oxford, I never would have opened my mouth.” Or might she have become academically inspired? “Well, that would have been nice ,” she replied, and laughed. “This isn’t therapy! I don’t want to be talked into eternal regret.” After graduating, in 1986, she worked for a while at Amnesty International, in London, on the research desk for Francophone Africa. In 1990, she had her Harry Potter inspiration, and began developing a detailed plan for a seven-book series. She also worked on an adult novel that she never finished. That year, her mother died. In 1991, she took a job as an English teacher in Portugal. “It was total fight or flight,” she said. “ I’d had a terrible time. Several things happened at once. My mother died, which was obviously the huge one. A long relationship I’d been in ended—and a couple of other things,” including being made redundant from an office job in Manchester. In Porto, she met and married Jorge Arantes, a journalist. She taught at night, and during the day she wrote and listened to Tchaikovsky’s Violin Concerto. Jessica was born in the summer of 1993, and the relationship with Arantes ended soon afterward. He was once quoted in the Daily Express describing their last night; he said that he had dragged her out of their home at five in the morning and slapped her hard. Rowling warned me not to think of the Portugal period, and her first marriage, as a cautious person’s regretted experiment in impetuousness—an E. M. Forster swoon in southern Europe. “I’ll agree with you that going somewhere hot when you’re British always seems like a good idea,” she said. But “that certainly wasn’t the first impetuous thing I’ve done. . . . I had leanings that way for a long time. It wasn’t that Hermione suddenly broke out.” At the end of 1993, she returned to Britain with Jessica, and spent Christmas in Edinburgh with her sister, who was working there as a nurse. Rowling, who no longer owned a winter coat, had three chapters of “Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone” in her suitcase.

We sat in the hotel lounge, in low red chairs. In a neighborhood full of coffee shops, she had brought me to an empty room. She recalled her arrival in Edinburgh. “I was very depressed,” she said. “I felt life was a train wreck. I’d carried this baby out of it, and I was in this place that was very alien and cold, and quite grim.” She decided to stay, with the intention of becoming a schoolteacher; she would need to complete a one-year training course but chose to delay enrollment until she’d finished her book. She signed up for welfare benefits, and found an unappealing apartment, where she lived for a few months. “I was trying to write through that time, and I did,” she said. “But it was patchy and fitful and sometimes I just didn’t have the focus to do it.” (Rowling did write a long, illustrated astrological birth chart for the newborn son of a friend.) She said, “It was Jessica—I have to credit her with so much—that gave me the impetus to go and say to a doctor, ‘I think I’m not quite right, and I need some help here.’ Having done that made a massive difference.” She began therapy, and “pressed on with the book, and things came together. In my head, at least. Externally, my life might not have looked a great deal better. My friend, I hope he wouldn’t mind me saying, my friend Sean, my oldest friend, he lent me a deposit on a much better rented flat.” (Sean Harris was the Wyedean friend with access to the Ford Anglia.) “And, you know, things slowly turned round.” She finished “Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone” in 1995, shortly before starting her teacher-training course. “Having that child forced me to finish the bloody book,” she said. “Not because I thought it was going to save us but because I thought it was going to be my last chance to finish it.” In “The Casual Vacancy,” Krystal Weedon is a teen-ager from the Fields, the housing project near Pagford, and she is the effective head of a household that includes a younger brother and their mother, a heroin addict. Rowling’s descriptions of the family are almost ostentatiously unremitting: drugs, prostitution, the stink of diapers. A visitor notices, in the front yard, “a used condom glistening in the grass beside her feet, like the gossamer cocoon of some huge grub.” There’s little sense that anyone ever made a life in the Fields, or cracked a joke, or hoped for anything but the salvation of Pagford and the middle class; Rowling’s empathy can feel like condescension. But there’s no doubt that she has an understanding of the extremes of British poverty, from sources that include her husband’s experience as a general practitioner in an Edinburgh drug-addiction clinic. (He now practices elsewhere.) Rowling has mocked journalists who, in her view, overdramatize her period of hardship—“I laughed myself stupid,” she has said, after a reporter suggested she couldn’t afford to buy writing paper—but she has contributed to this confusion. In 2008, while in a New York courtroom to oppose the publication of an unauthorized Harry Potter encyclopedia, she testified that there had been times when she was “literally choosing between food and a typewriter ribbon.” She has described her first year or so in Edinburgh as a time of “abject poverty,” or “grinding poverty.” Such language seems to blur the distinction between her life and Krystal Weedon’s. When she spoke at Harvard, she declared that she had been as broke “as it is possible to be in modern Britain without being homeless.” This self-portrait—and talk about life on welfare as “the most soul-destroying thing”—may reflect honorable British embarrassment about the scale of her earnings over the past fifteen years. It balances a private ledger of good fortune and bad fortune. Her account of economic despair, and recovery, may also have a noble political purpose: Rowling has publicly defended Britain’s welfare system against threatened cuts. And it’s true to say that she was a broke single mother, in poor accommodations, at a time of high unemployment. One could understand if she did not want this period to be mistaken for slacker slumming—and her depression may have obscured any advantages she had over other jobless Britons. But those advantages are clear in retrospect: she was a middle-class graduate, poised to start a teaching career, who claimed modest state benefits while she finished a novel, which she partly wrote in an upscale café owned by her sister’s husband. (Such state benefits—for housing and living costs—were then more easily accessible to young British graduates at the start of a professional career than they have ever been in the United States.) This is hard to classify as abject poverty. She has said, “I had to decide whether my baby would rather be handed over to somebody else for most of her waking hours, or be cared for by her mother in far from luxurious surroundings. I chose the latter option.” As she told me, of her time after Portugal, “There wasn’t really any drift. I came back with a plan, I definitely came back with a plan.”

“Dear Mr. Little,” Rowling wrote, in a 1995 letter. “I enclose a synopsis and sample chapters for a book intended for children aged 9–12. I would be very grateful if you could tell me if you would be interested in seeing the full manuscript. Yours sincerely, Joanne Rowling.” Christopher Little, a fairly obscure London literary agent, took her on. A year later, he made a modest deal with Bloomsbury, a British publisher that was only a decade old. “Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone” appeared in 1997, with an initial print run of five hundred. It won Children’s Book of the Year at the British Book Awards, and a gold award in the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize, which is voted for by children. The book also sold to Scholastic, in New York, for more than a hundred thousand dollars. Rowling bought an apartment. She published the second novel, “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,” in 1998. Maria Tatar, a Harvard scholar of children’s literature, recently told me, “It took me years to like Harry Potter.” She now includes the final Potter novel in an undergraduate course entitled “Fairy Tales and Fantasy Literature.” When she first read the books, she recalled, she “could not remember anything.” Then she listened to the audiobooks. “All of a sudden, I got it—I could remember it, and I could visualize it. So much of it is dialogue. It’s not exploring minds. It’s conversations and actions that drive these books.” You’re in the skin of a wizard—“You’re moving along with Harry”—even if you have little access to his mind. She added, “It’s a strange combination of both superficial and deep. That’s what people forget about children’s literature. It is very surface-oriented, but the great writers, and I include Rowling in them, manage to get the depth in, too”—life and death, good and evil. “It’s not a psychological depth but a mythological depth.” Tatar’s students grew up with the books. “You can’t imagine what happens when I just say ‘Harry Potter,’ ” she said. “They’re transported. And they start to speak Harry Potter among themselves, and I feel like an alien.” Many of her students report that, as children, they learned about learning from the books’ depiction of Hogwarts. “It reshaped their understanding of what education was about—and what adults were about. They could recruit these adults and have them help landscape their lives.” Rowling told me, “Very recently, I met a girl in a shop. She was in her early twenties, and she came up to me and said, ‘May I hug you?’ And I said yes, and we hugged. And she said, ‘You were my childhood.’ That’s an amazing thing to hear.” Some people find this disheartening. In Edinburgh, I met Alan Taylor, a journalist and the editor of the Scottish Review of Books , who despaired of Rowling’s “tin ear” and said of her readers, “They were giving their childhood to this woman! They were starting at seven, and by the time they were sixteen they were still reading bloody Harry Potter—sixteen-year-olds, wearing wizard outfits, who should have been shagging behind the bike shed and smoking marijuana and reading Camus.” The Harry Potter books are not rebellious. They validate the concerns of ordinary children: fascination with weird teachers, distress about bullies, desire for status objects. (Broomsticks stand in for the latest electronics.) And Harry, for all the Dickensian under-the-stairs trauma of his early years, starts the series as a winner; he’s wealthy, athletically adept, and famous. Rowling’s respect for a youthful world view never wavers, and her characters do not learn their way out of it. Her achievement is to transfer the everyday dramas of schoolchildren into an abundantly imagined parallel universe. Rowling describes at least four ways, including broomsticks, to move magically from place to place. She uses dozens of beasts from the mythological canon and establishes new myths with matter-of-fact ease. (The idea of a Parselmouth—a person who can speak to snakes—seems ancient and fully formed.) She uses plot devices that could each fuel countless romantic comedies: a truth serum, transfiguration, time travel, invisibility, immortality, alchemy. Readers of the series lived with Harry, but also with Rowling, as the almost-visible engineer of a great fantasy machine that, in the course of seven volumes, runs with remarkable smoothness. Even young enthusiasts seemed to become textual critics of a sort—alert to the idea of an author, at a desk, making decisions about who should live and who should die. “I do think that’s a lot of what children responded to—that sense that someone was in control,” Rowling said. “That they were walking into a place where they knew the rules, or there were rules to be discovered.” There’s little irony, and the reader rarely knows more or less than Harry. In the seven novels, Christmas Day always falls midway. Stephen King and others have teased Rowling for overusing adverbs when describing speech. The habit seems to show a determination not to be misunderstood. So too, in a way, do her repetitions. (Over a few hundred pages, as Harry enters adolescence, Diggory reddens, Harry reddens, Ron reddens, and Fudge reddens; Percy goes slightly pink, then very pink; Hermione is slightly pink; Malfoy is slightly pink and then brilliantly pink; Hermione is very pink and then rather pink; Colin also goes pink; Hermione is, again, slightly pink; so is Ron, and then Hermione; and then she’s flushed pink with pleasure. Lavender blushes, followed by Hagrid and Hermione.) And if Rowling’s metaphors were sometimes grudging—“like some bizarre fast-growing flower”; “like some weird crab”—it may be because metaphors carry you away, for a moment, from the place where the story has put you. Rowling’s goal was to keep you there. Rowling’s mindfulness about plot led her to have almost the same relationship with her material as an obsessive fan did. Ian Rankin recalled bumping into her one day in an Edinburgh café: “It was incredible to see her, writing longhand, doing this family tree for a character. I can’t think of any other author I know who would go into that kind of detail for something that’s not going to be there on the page.” It was like a video game where you never got to the edge of the rendered landscape. Despite the thoroughness of the final reckoning in “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” and its extended epilogue, there’s much that Rowling knows but has not written. In 2007, after the final book was published, she announced that Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts, was gay. I asked her if Dudley, Harry’s cousin, had any children as an adult, and she told me that he had two.

“We coined the phrase ‘denial marketing,’ ” Minna Fry, a former marketing director of Bloomsbury, recently said of the series. “The more people want, the less you give.” Ahead of each publication, she said, “we were extremely tantalizing—releasing little nuggets.” She laughed. “If you were really lucky, you’d get the title! ” As Fry remembers it, the phenomenon changed complexion with the appearance of the fourth novel, “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,” in the summer of 2000. It was the first time that the publication of a Rowling book was synchronized across the Atlantic. Between them, Bloomsbury and Scholastic printed a first edition of more than four million copies. Bloomsbury decked out a steam train as the Hogwarts Express, and it took Rowling around the U.K. Bloomsbury was still a small company; Fry inflated the balloons herself. “We didn’t have events managers,” she said. On the first day, she and her colleagues were astonished by the size of the crowds at King’s Cross. “We couldn’t even get into the station. Can you imagine what it would be like now, with Twitter?” Fry found a reporter from an American newsmagazine hiding in the coal bin behind the steam engine, her face smudged black. When the train made stops, children awaiting an audience with Rowling entered her rail car at one end, and left at the other end with a signed book. As Fry recalled, “There were parents beating up other parents to get in the queue.” At one besieged stop, Fry was Rowling’s decoy, waving to the crowd through a window at the front of the train while Rowling escaped from the rear. Fry said that Rowling was unsettled by the disorder of the tour: “She loved bits of it. But I don’t think any of us realized quite how freaked out she was.” Fry learned this only later. “She was quite thin-skinned about something that we thought was quite funny. I think she thought we’d put her in jeopardy.” Fry had enjoyed a friendly relationship with Rowling, but after that book’s launch Rowling “started to have these layers of people to protect her.” She hired her own public-relations team, and became a little sequestered behind “people who I think made her feel safe.” Unlike before, “we weren’ t able to ring her up and gossip. But she was still kind, funny—very funny—and slightly bewildered by the whole thing. And still deserving of all the good things.” Fry recalled coming across Rowling and her children, not long ago, in a playground in a London park. Fry introduced her young son (who said, “You’re not J. K. Rowling!”), and she was struck by the force of Rowling’s attention upon him. “She was fascinated by everything he was doing, what he was wearing. He had a new toy. She wanted to know how it worked, everything about it.” When I asked Rowling about the period after “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,” she said, “That was a really hard time for me. The pressure of it had become overwhelming, actually. I found it difficult to write, which had never happened to me before in my life. The intensity of the scrutiny was overwhelming. I had been utterly unprepared for that. And I needed to step back. Badly needed to step back.” She had published four books in four years. “I said to Bloomsbury, ‘There won’t be a book next year, I can’t do it,’ which they were great about. It ended up being three years. So it was 2000 for ‘Goblet of Fire,’ and 2003 for ‘Phoenix.’ ” In that time, Warner Bros. began releasing films based on the novels—with a predominantly British cast, thanks in part to Rowling’s pressure. The movies have since made $7.7 billion. She also met Neil Murray, a friend of her sister’s. Rowling resisted being set up: “He was just out of a marriage himself—I just thought that would be complicated. I wasn’t up for that.” But they eventually found themselves seated next to each other at a charity event in Edinburgh. He was aware of the Harry Potter books but hadn’t read them. The couple have a son and a daughter together. A few years ago, a documentary crew travelling with Rowling recorded what seems to be Murray’s only public comment about his wife: “Jo detaches herself,” he said, in her hearing, with a smile. “When she’s very stressed, she’ll detach herself and only trust one person, and that’s herself. So everyone else gets blocked out and she becomes more and more stressed and less and less able to accept any help.”

Late last year, Rowling appeared at the Leveson Inquiry into British press conduct, set up by the government in response to revelations about reporters hacking into celebrity voice-mail inboxes. Over months, scores of actors, politicians, and journalists offered evidence to the inquiry; Rowling appeared on the same day as Sienna Miller, the actress, and Max Mosely, a former car-racing administrator. Mosley described being secretly photographed with five women in a scenario that the News of the World described, falsely, as an enactment of a Nazi-related sexual fantasy with prostitutes. Miller said that, for years, she had to contend with ten or fifteen paparazzi outside her home; she had been chased by them, and even spat upon to provoke a reaction. Her phone was hacked. But Miller was careful to emphasize that others, including the family of Milly Dowler, a murdered teen-ager whose phone was hacked after her disappearance, had experienced worse. “Dear old Havemeyer-he died in the saddle.” Rowling’s evidence was less startling, but it was delivered in a more harrowed, aggrieved tone. It may be that, because Rowling is quite unassuming, she has not thought to learn the art of appearing unassuming in public. (Indeed, her public posture is often that of someone wronged: she has described buying herself a big aquamarine ring as a “no one is grinding me down” gesture made in response to tabloid coverage, and has characterized moving from an apartment to a very large house as being “driven out” by the press.) She told the inquiry that, when Jessica was five, she once came home from school with a note from a reporter in her schoolbag, apparently placed there by the parent of a classmate. One can’t argue with Rowling’s unhappiness about the episode, but it seems a poor example of Fleet Street’s darkest arts. A few years later, Rowling was photographed on a public beach in Mauritius. One published image showed Jessica, breaking a British press rule about paparazzi shots of children. (It was not republished.) More recently, Rowling and Murray were photographed on an Edinburgh street, and the published shot showed the face of their son, David, at nineteen months. Rowling had other stories to tell, and spoke of the burden of having to take preventive measures to avoid further intrusion. But when she wrote, in her witness statement, that “it pains me that my family and I do not appear to have the choice of living our lives in the same way that other members of the general public do,” the wealthiest novelist in history was perhaps asking for too much. She and her family have spent a private evening at the White House, and she told me that the Obama daughters like her books. Across the world, fans call her “My Queen.” And if Rowling, by the standards of her fortune, lives quite modestly—Ian Rankin has told her that, in her position, he would buy a helicopter and gold-plated pinball machines—public documents show that, to expand the grounds of her Edinburgh house, she recently bought and demolished a modern, $1.6-million house that stood next door. Her discomfort with fame can give her the air of being more caught up with the idea of her celebrity than those she’s addressing. Encouraged by Lord Justice Leveson to make recommendations for reform, she said, “I can’t pretend I have a magical answer,” and added, “No Harry Potter joke intended.” If Rowling has become exasperated by the media, the feeling has been reciprocated. When the London Times interviewed her in 2003, it was asked to sign a contract that, according to an account later written by Brian MacArthur, then the paper’s executive editor, “stipulated precisely when the interview would occur and who would be the interviewer and photographer; how and where it would be advertised and promoted in the paper and on radio; and gave Rowling full approval of captions, headlines, straplines, line drawings, graphics, headings, advance trails, quotes and photographs.” Just before publication, there was a gruelling, six-hour argument in the Times offices about what, exactly, was meant by “quote approval.” Rowling was represented by Neil Blair, a British lawyer and a former Warner Bros. executive who had worked on the Harry Potter films, and who joined Christopher Little’s agency in 2001. Blair said that in the interview Rowling had misspoken about her contract with Bloomsbury, and, in insisting that the quote be revised, took a stance that MacArthur found extraordinarily aggressive. MacArthur wrote in his paper that this “left us feeling soiled,” adding, “our self-respect was eroded, our journalistic integrity insulted.” Minna Fry, who was also at the meeting, says that she was, at times, “astonished by what Neil was doing,” and had her head in her hands. “I realized how much was now at stake.” Blair, remembering that day, said he would “swear on the Bible that I was not aggressive at all.” (For this article, Rowling sought quote approval, which was not given.) Last summer, Neil Blair left Christopher Little and set up his own agency. Rowling joined him as the star client of the Blair Partnership. Little’s statement, at the time, was that he was “disappointed and surprised.” As Rowling described it to me, “Neil and Christopher reached a point where it wasn’t working, the two of them together, and I had to make a decision. It was very, very difficult.”"

They remind us of nature’s irreverent brutality, and of its occasional inexplicability. They evoke places where people can’t survive. But when removed from those places—their native habitats—individually potted, and sold as decoration for a house, a garden, or an office, they are among the easiest plants a person can have, requiring little or no care and still looking good. More unusual species can be novelties, or prizes for collectors, or even significant investments. But many people never consider where their potted cactus or succulent originated, and what purpose its bizarre characteristics served. The magnificent landscapes and ecosystems in which the plant evolved are forgotten.

This bothered three cactus-crazed young men in Los Angeles—Jeff Kaplon, Max Martin, and Carlos Morera—who in 2014 opened the Cactus Store, a boutique featuring a large collection of unusual, interesting, and, in some cases, rare species of cactuses and succulents. (Cactuses are a family within the taxonomy of succulents.) Since California was well into a severe drought, many residents were switching to drought-resilient landscapes, and the timing of the opening, although coincidental, was fortunate. The store was a hit. Selling plants was not, however, its only goal. Kaplon, Martin, and Morera wanted to guide cactus and succulent neophytes beyond a simple aesthetic appreciation of each cactus in its pot. If a customer was admiring an Oreocereus celsianus (commonly known as the old man of the mountain), she would learn before leaving the store that it comes from the high Andes, and that its fluffy mop of white hair evolved to defend it from the sun and the snow.

As the three men expanded their cactus collection and their depth of knowledge, they became increasingly captivated by historic, documentary-style photographs of cactuses and succulents in the wild, most of which were the output of previous generations of devoted cactus hunters. These older obsessives had travelled the world, sometimes taking considerable physical risks, just to see certain species in their native habitats, or to see them in bloom, or to search for others more rare. Over decades, evidence of what these explorers discovered, and of the extreme journeys they took, has been stashed away in bargain bins at cactus shows, in shoe boxes in collectors’ garages, and in dusty old slide carousels that reside with the region’s many cactus-and-succulent clubs. Kaplon, Martin, and Morera gathered as much of this archival material as they could, and eventually decided to put several hundred pictures, drawn from twenty-two explorers’ archives and spanning eighty years, into a new book. They researched and edited the images, conducted interviews with some of the photographer-explorers, and now are preparing to publish the result, titled “ Xerophile: Cactus Photographs from Expeditions of the Obsessed .”

In the same way that a bouquet of wildflowers is lovely but banal while an alpine meadow of blooming wildflowers is astonishing and sublime, these pictures demonstrate how arresting the sight of ancient, alien cactuses in the places they grow wild can be. What is immediately striking in the photos is the unimaginable sizes and shapes of various species, whether gigantic or minuscule, phallic or globose. In one image, several Ferocactus diguetii (giant barrel cactus), photographed in Baja California, Mexico, rise from a clearing, resembling the Jolly Green Giant’s extremities if he were standing underground and all you could see above ground were his fat fingertips (or perhaps another appendage) sticking up from the dry, rocky soil. Another shot of the same species shows a woman with a backpack staring up at a Ferocactus diguetii in disbelief. She is less than half its height and a fraction of its girth. In Chile, a species known as Copiapoa columna-alba is similarly huge, erect, and barrelled—if much harder and denser than Ferocactus . One plant in the book is estimated to be at least five hundred years old, “making it a juvenile at the time of Columbus,” the caption reads. Other clumps of Copiapoa depicted could be more than a thousand years old. One of my favorite photos, shot in Quebrada del Toro, in Argentina, shows many tall Trichocereus (sometimes called torch cactus) growing like menhirs among old gravestones in an abandoned cemetery.

While all of those large cactuses are most commonly seen in nurseries and plant shops as tiny nubs in petite terra-cotta pots, there are many rare, sought-after, mostly unknown species that never grow bigger than a nickel. The so-called belly plant, which lives on mudflats in Mexico, requires a searcher to be on her belly to find it. Rebutia schatzliana , in Bolivia, is smaller than a fingernail (as seen in a picture comparing the two) and grows a glorious miniature red flower. Then, there is the most lovable (and possibly the tiniest) tiny cactus in the world: Blossfeldia liliputana . Its mature size is ten millimetres, and its species name derives from the fictional country of Lilliput, created by Jonathan Swift, in “Gulliver’s Travels.” Native to northern Argentina and southern Bolivia, it often grows on sheer mudstone cliffs or tree bark, usually close to a waterfall. When it blooms, its nearly microscopic white-and-pink flowers are best seen with a magnifying glass.

“Xerophile” is, in sum, a catalogue of wonders that most of us will never get to see in person. Even if we knew where to find these plants in the wild, only a small number of people have enough interest, or obsession, to actually seek them out. Meanwhile, though, potted cactuses and succulents have become the “it” plants—hip, exotic, and, increasingly, ubiquitous. In London, a young woman recently opened a cactus boutique called Prick, inspired in part by the Cactus Store in Los Angeles. And in June, Kaplon, Martin, and Morera opened a pop-up store in a makeshift greenhouse in New York City’s Chinatown. But perhaps it’s fitting that cactuses and succulents are today’s botanical vogue. They represent what people crave and aspire to, as climate change advances and democratic institutions retreat: they can survive the harshest weather and the bleakest landscapes. They are both irreverent and dignified. They are strong and resilient, and will endure for centuries, even millennia.

Still, most people will never want to own a plant like Welwitschia mirabilis —one of the most bizarre succulents in the world, and the rarest plant for sale at the pop-up Cactus Store in Chinatown. It grows wild in the Namib, an ancient, stark desert along the Namibian coast, and it has only two leaves, which keep slowly growing—wrapping, curling, and ripping—into giant, six-foot-long tangles. Some are estimated to be two thousand years old. The Welwitscia in the store is an ugly little two-leaved weed. To the obsessed, however, it’s a work of art.

“Xerophile: Cactus Photographs from Expeditions of the Obsessed” will be published on August 29th, by Hat & Beard Press."
475,http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/trump-jr-and-why-spies-love-business,newyorker,"Trump, Jr., and Why Spies Love Business",[],"My grandmother’s close friend and, I later learned, occasional lover was, in the fullest sense of the phrase, an international man of mystery. He had a lavish apartment in Manhattan, across from Lincoln Center, and another in London, as well as homes in Israel and France, and he travelled from one to another, showing up suddenly and disappearing just as quickly. He told me sometimes about his impoverished childhood, in Lithuania and in New Jersey; it was never clear exactly how he had become wealthy. There was talk of “interests” in various firms, of lucky real-estate investments, of his time running the production company that made the James Bond films. Much later, not long before his death, in 2004, I learned the truth, revealed by documents unearthed after the fall of the Soviet Union: Joseph Katz was an important Soviet agent in New York and Europe in the nineteen-thirties and forties. His cover was running businesses that his Soviet bosses had created for him. He had a front company that manufactured gloves, another that owned parking lots, and a third that did importing and exporting.

I thought of Joe recently when I heard about the meeting between Donald Trump, Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort, and a group of Russian, British, and Georgian businesspeople, some of whom have connections to Russian intelligence. The meeting, which was held in Trump Tower, last June, was arranged by a pop star (whose billionaire father, a Russian real-estate mogul, had financed his career) and his British public-relations man, who, apparently, was happy to add international intrigue to his list of services. The guests included Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer who has represented the F.S.B., her country’s intelligence service, and Irakly Kaveladze, a financier who has been investigated by Congress for laundering Russian money through companies in Delaware. The ostensible agenda for the meeting ranged from the political (possible dirt on Hillary Clinton) to the financial (lifting American sanctions on Russian oligarchs and their companies).

In Joe’s time, there was a sharper distinction between business and espionage. Joe once wrote that he had “dreams of creating a better world.” His motivation was ideological, and his companies were a tool whose value—whose very existence—would disappear when Communism won. The meeting at Trump Tower is an example of the crude form of capitalism that ultimately triumphed in Russia. Now business is both goal and tool, inducement for coöperation and its reward.

“There’s a natural fit between business and intelligence,” Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a former C.I.A. operative who runs intelligence and defense projects at Harvard’s Kennedy School, told me. Spies carefully assess the commitments and vulnerabilities of potential sources; when camps are set up along moral lines, such as pro- and anti-Communist, it is difficult to move somebody from one to another. Businesspeople are less of a challenge. “Anytime you have money involved, it’s perfect for intelligence officers,” Mowatt-Larssen said.

This doesn’t mean that businesspeople are knowingly aiding foreign intelligence services for a few bucks. Rather, it suggests that it is far easier for spies to gather information when it comes out of a business relationship. Indeed, Russian intelligence has demonstrated something of an obsession with the real-estate and finance industries. Vince Houghton, the curator and historian at the International Spy Museum, in Washington, D.C., reminded me of the last major Russian spy scandal, in 2010, when the U.S. government arrested ten Russian agents living in America undercover. One, a woman born Anya Kushchenko but going by Anna Chapman, hid her activities behind her online real-estate startup. Another, Lidiya Guryev, who used the alias Cynthia Murphy, attended Columbia Business School and sought relationships in New York finance, particularly with Alan Patricof, a billionaire who co-chaired Hillary Clinton’s 2008 Presidential campaign. Guryev’s handlers in Moscow urged her “to build up relations little by little” with Patricof (she wasn’t successful); they also thanked her for uncovering details of the gold market.

The methods of today’s Russian spies are similar to those of their Soviet predecessors, with one significant difference. “To big-business types,” Houghton said, “the Soviets could not offer financial incentives worth their time.” Today, Russians “can offer incentives in the billions: ‘We’ll bring you into a Russian natural-gas consortium.’ ” A business deal can be an opportunity for profit as well as a lure into a murkier relationship.

Joe Katz ultimately rejected Soviet Communism, in part because of a K.G.B. purge of Jewish agents. He parlayed his front businesses into a profitable career, and into a life of good food, fine drink, and romantic liaisons. A recent article about him in Commentary revealed that Israeli intelligence and F.B.I. officials puzzled over this former Soviet agent: Was he loyal to Russia? To Israel? To America? What seems clear from Joe’s personal correspondence, collected in a moving book, “Letters to My Brother,” is that, for Joe, it was not an ideology that replaced Communism: it was money. ♦"

For starters, Odd Future, the California rap collective he founded, is now more or less defunct, with several of its members, including Earl Sweatshirt, Syd tha Kyd, and Frank Ocean, having embarked on successful solo careers. It is also more difficult, in the age of six-second viral content and ice-bucket challenges, for natural provocateurs such as Tyler—infamous for eating a roach in a music video and humping a bag of golf clubs—to grab people’s attention via the Internet. At some point, even the class clown has to decide that it is time to grow up.

That is exactly what happens on Tyler’s new solo album, “Flower Boy,” a taut, forty-six-minute collection of fifteen songs, in which a young man whose lyrics were once marked by casual misogyny and homophobia trades in his trolling behavior for more introspective material. This is especially true on the song “Where This Flower Blooms,” an ebullient piano track that features backing vocals from Ocean and lyrics that suggest that Odd Future’s perpetual prankster has finally decided to embrace the journey toward adulthood, and to open up about the isolation, boredom, self-doubt, and loneliness that come with it.

On “Where This Flower Blooms,” Tyler reminisces about a time when things were less complicated, and reflects on the life of a young man trying to learn about himself on his own time and on his own terms. “Tell these black kids they could be who they are / Dye your hair blue, Shit, I’ll do it too,” he raps, telegraphing his dedication to hip-hop’s next generation of insurgents. The lines are delivered in the same sly, deep, guttural tone that Tyler is known for, but this time they sound a little more sincere. Perhaps they are coming from someone who has grown more comfortable living in his own skin.

480,http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson-sorkin/donald-trump-tramples-on-boy-scout-values,newyorker,Donald Trump Tramples on Boy Scout Values,[],"President Donald Trump was onstage at the quadrennial National Boy Scout Jamboree on Monday, in Glen Jean, West Virginia, when he turned to Tom Price, his Secretary of Health and Human Services and a former Scout, who was standing behind him, with a question. “You going to get the votes?” he asked. The votes in question, he’d explained to the Scouts in attendance, were for “killing this horrible thing known as Obamacare that’s really hurting us, folks,” in favor of a Republican bill that would deprive an estimated twenty-two million Americans of their health-care coverage. He didn’t ask the Scouts if any of their families might be among that number; instead, he asked them to join him in mocking his subordinate.

“He’d better get them,” Trump said. “He’d better get them. Ooh, he’d better—otherwise, I’ll say, ‘Tom, you’re fired !’ ” He delivered this line with his signature finger-pointing gesture, and basked in hoots from the crowd. Another President might have evoked the kinds of stories that the Scouts share over campfires, or on the trail. Trump started with the assumption that they had spent quality time huddled in front of a television set, watching him on “ The Apprentice .” What is a merit badge, after all, next to winning a challenge to come up with a campaign for a Trump-branded product?

The televised image of him punishing an underling seemed to bring Trump particular pleasure, because it had to do with the one Boy Scout value that the President highlighted, rather than ignored, albeit in a distorted form: loyalty. The broadest point of criticism about Trump’s appearance at the event has been that he politicized the moment, but that was not, or not exactly, the main problem. The Boy Scouts do have a political meaning; otherwise, the various fights over the years to expand the franchise, as it were, by lifting a ban on gay Scouts, in 2014, and, a year later, on gay Scout leaders, would not have been so fraught. It was in the name of speaking politically about that ban that President Barack Obama skipped the jamboree, though he sent a recorded message. (Trump elided that reason when he asked the Scouts, sarcastically, whether Obama had shown up.) Other Presidents have spoken at the jamboree about democratic values, at times in the form of warnings about tyranny abroad, or about specific issues, such as drug addiction. (The Washington Post has a good catalogue .) They were, though, more subtle than Trump, who, after joking about firing Price, added, “He’d better get Senator Capito to vote for it!”—a reference to Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, who so far has been hesitant to jettison the interests of her constituents to vote for her party’s miserable health-care bill. What was different about Trump was not that he spoke politically but that he did so in a way that was demagogic, non-inclusive, dishonest, and, at times, simply crude.

One parable that Trump presented to the boys—it was, again, more of a reality-television recap than a campfire tale—included several of those elements. It involved a man in the tri-state area, a builder of homes, perhaps much like the President, who, three quarters of a century ago, “became an unbelievable success, and got more and more successful.” The man was named William Levitt—“Anyone ever hear of Levittown?”—and Trump made him sound like the miller’s daughter from “Rumpelstiltskin”: “At night he’d go to these major sites with teams of people and he’d scour the sites for nails and sawdust and small pieces of wood. And they’d clean the site so when the workers came in the next morning, the sites would be spotless and clean, and he did it properly. And he did this for twenty years, and then he was offered a lot of money for his company.” Like magic! And, of course, with the help of the G.I. Bill’s mortgage assistance, and while refusing to sell to black home buyers until he was forced to after a long series of lawsuits—but Trump, whose own family of builders had to settle discrimination suits, skipped that. What mattered was that Levitt “sold his company for a tremendous amount of money. And he went out and bought a big yacht. And he had a very interesting life.”

It was at this point that the President of the United States began to leer in front of forty thousand Boy Scouts. He hadn’t forgotten whom he was talking to; their adolescent male status, and all that he imagined that to mean, was, rather, the point: “You’re Boy Scouts, so I’m not going to tell you what he did.” He spoke like a man who wanted to be asked to post some lewd pictures: “Should I tell you? Should I tell you? Oh, you’re Boy Scouts, but you know life.”

He never did say what happened on the yacht, which, according to Levitt’s Times obituary , was named La Belle Simone, for his third wife. When Levitt sold his business to I.T.T., he got sixty-two million dollars of that company’s stock. He borrowed recklessly against it, got involved in shaky foreign ventures with dubious partners, and lost it all. (“There were terrible articles, and he would say, ‘Ah, Simone, it’s yellow journalism. You can’t believe what you read. Do you trust me?’ ” Simone Levitt told New York magazine, in 2013.) Trump acknowledged the fall, but offered the Boy Scouts a different explanation, one that was revealed when he, Trump, approached the sage at a cocktail party thrown by Steve Ross, whom he seemed to assume was a stock figure for the Boy Scouts. (“One of the great people—he came up and discovered, really founded, Time Warner.”) It was one of the “hottest” parties, and people were ignoring “the once great William Levitt of Levittown.” Whether this was because, as Trump posited, there were so many other celebrities around, or because it was around the time that Levitt was charged with wrongly taking five million dollars from a charitable foundation, is anybody’s guess. Trump, who, as the Washington Post pointed out, once had his own foundation pay Donald Trump, Jr.,’s seven-dollar Boy Scout registration fee, may not have cared. What Trump of Trump Tower wanted to know was how Levitt had fallen so far.

“And he said, ‘Donald, I lost my momentum. I lost my momentum,’ ” Trump said. It was, the President told the Scouts, too true. For anyone taking a glance at Levitt’s career, it was also baffling. Momentum toward what, with what values to guide him? Success, a word that Trump uses frequently, was the theme of his speech, and yet he could hardly have imagined that concept—and how it applied to the boys who were listening to him and their place in the world—in a more bereft way: kill Obamacare; mind your yacht; fire people who don’t deliver, because “we could use some more loyalty, I will tell you that.” He announced, “The Scouts believe in putting America First!”; The “fake news” media was going to lie about their number; under the Trump Administration, “you’ll be saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again when you go shopping. Believe me. ‘Merry Christmas!’ ”

After telling the tale of William Levitt, and offering a brief rumination about not taking too much time off, and the foolishness of most business advice other than his own (“Some of these guys that never made ten cents, they’re on television giving you things about how you’re going to be successful, and the only thing they ever did was a book and a tape”), Trump moved on to asking the boys if they remembered the great night when he won the election. He pictured them, again, watching television. “That map was so red, it was unbelievable! “ he said. That was back when he had momentum."
481,http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/the-middle-school-friends-behind-brigsby-bear,newyorker,The Middle-School Friends Behind “Brigsby Bear”,[],"The new film “Brigsby Bear” is bouncy, promising, and a little clumsy. It’s like a middle schooler. That’s fitting, since twenty years ago the three men who made it were friends, in San Diego, at Thurgood Marshall Middle School.

Over lunch recently at Margaux, in Greenwich Village, “Brigsby” ’s brain trust—Kyle Mooney, a co-writer and the star; Kevin Costello, the other co-writer; and Dave McCary, the director—finished one another’s sentences and did a lot of supportive nodding. They had similar beards, though each claimed to have grown his for personal reasons. The shaggy-haired Mooney, who plays exuberantly inept characters on “Saturday Night Live,” declared, “When summer comes, I like to let loose!” McCary, a ruminative man who directs many of Mooney’s pre-taped “S.N.L.” segments, said, “I’m just generally lazy.” Costello added, “And I just have a fat old face.” McCary said, “We actually got together today to talk about Kevin’s insecurities.”

In “Brigsby Bear,” Mooney plays a twentysomething man named James, who has grown up in a bunker and been reared on a retro TV show about a Teddy Ruxpin-like talking bear. One day, the police break in, and James finds out that his “parents” (Mark Hamill and Jane Adams) kidnapped him as a baby, and that Hamill’s character made “Brigsby Bear Adventures” for him alone. (He played Brigsby himself, wearing a fur suit and a roly-poly bear’s head.) Restored to his real family, James begins by embracing everything—“Want a beer?” “Yes, I would like one of that!”—a wide-eyed immigrant to modern life.

After the trio ordered sandwiches and glasses of rosé, Costello recalled that when he arrived in San Diego from Oklahoma, in seventh grade, McCary and Mooney were his guides. They introduced him to Limp Bizkit and surfer style. “They weren’t that cool, but they were funny and they didn’t give too much of a shit,” he said.

“I totally cared,” McCary said. “That I didn’t have access to the money to get the coolest clothes ate away at me.”

“I was the strongest guy in my class,” Mooney boasted, preposterously. “I kind of bullied these guys.” He swung his arms like Bluto.

“I knew from middle school that Kyle’s ability to create comedic discomfort was different,” McCary said. “Both Kevin and I had the fortunate situation that when Kyle was establishing himself I was his one filmmaker friend and Kevin was our one screenwriter friend. We just happened to supply the things that could help Kyle excel.”

Mooney said, “Our classmates from that era totally influence the stuff Dave and I have done.”

“It’s a special shorthand no one else but our classmates gets,” McCary said.

“Like Jim,” Mooney explained. “I’m just going to call him Jim S. Sweatpants all the time, constant erection, reading fantasy books, talking to himself.”

“That was hilarious,” Costello said, dryly.

In “Brigsby,” after James figures out the contours of the world via a lot of Google searches, he focusses on what matters most to him: making a film about Brigsby and pulling in his friends to help—just as Mooney did. Costello said, “The most interesting thing to us was never the kidnapping and abuse, never ‘Oh, how deep the evil of man,’ but instead: What if the only story you’d ever been told never had an ending? How badly would you want to finish it? Because that story would be your religion, your everything.”

McCary said that Mark Hamill’s character “is a fucked-up Jim Henson, teaching weird lessons about the world in a loving way.” He finished his chicken sandwich and added, “Kevin and I grew up in pretty intense Christian households. My dad was a Seventh-Day Adventist pastor, and from an early age I was put off by being force-fed a belief system. So I was really fiending for the darkest, sexiest stuff, the absolute slums of life.” He looked across the table, shyly. “I don’t imagine you guys would want to make those kinds of films, though.”

Costello frowned, and Mooney shook his head, saying, “I kind of really want to collaborate with some new people on the next one.” Everyone laughed. “The truth is,” Mooney continued, “I’ll silence myself from going dark even in conversations like this. I don’t want my mom to know that I jerk off, like, six times a day.”

McCary said, “The next movie will include a full twenty-minute take of you masturbating—the beginning, middle, and end of that experience.”

“I actually have that video!” Mooney cried.

As lunch wound down, the friends talked about having dinner together, and their disbelief that they had somehow raised four million dollars, secured actors such as Greg Kinnear and Claire Danes, and made a film. “I’m not a major name,” Mooney said, “so we certainly needed the other actors to sell the movie.”

“You’re a major name to us!” McCary said.

Mooney laughed. “And that’s why I like to talk to you guys!” ♦"

Technically, it’s the Walt Disney Company, which bought the Muppets, in 2004. Spiritually, it’s Jim Henson, who created the Muppets and was the voice and soul of Kermit until his untimely death, of an infection, in 1990. Beyond that, there are a few other claimants. Henson’s five children became custodians of his creations after his death and have overseen a winding path of corporate ownership, while continuing to promote their father’s legacy. And there are the millions of children who grew up with Kermit and feel entitled to a piece of him. (The rusting Muppet lunchbox on my dresser qualifies me as part of that group.)

Then there’s the ragtag band of puppeteers whom Henson drew into his enchanted orbit, among them Steve Whitmire, who played Kermit from Henson’s death until recently. His firing, which got out earlier this month, brought the question of the character’s divided froghood to the fore. Whitmire told the Hollywood Reporter that Disney had replaced him over a union-related quibble and some unwanted note-giving during the short-lived (and admittedly flawed ) ABC series “The Muppets.” In response, Disney’s Muppets Studio said that Whitmire had displayed “unacceptable business conduct,” while Cheryl Henson, the second-oldest of the Henson children, wrote on Facebook that Whitmire had been playing Kermit as “a bitter, angry, depressed victim,” and called for a return to the “true spirit of Jim Henson’s Kermit!”

Fortunately, anyone longing for the “true spirit” of Jim Henson has a new place to seek it out. The Museum of the Moving Image , in Astoria, has just opened a permanent Jim Henson exhibition, which offers a zoological tour of his restlessly creative spirit. I went last week during a preview event, where the hors d’œuvres included Fraggle Tartines, Labyrinth Frittatas, and (It’s Not That Easy Being) Green Gazpacho. Upstairs, children and former children were sidling up to Rowlf and Big Bird—under glass, but close enough that you longed to give them a big hug. There was also Miss Piggy in her wedding dress, from “The Muppets Take Manhattan”; David Bowie’s goblin-king robe, from “Labyrinth”; and the cassette tape that Henson used to learn (or mislearn) Swedish, in preparation to play the Swedish Chef.

Henson’s brand of “affectionate anarchy”—as his closest collaborator, Frank Oz, put it in Brian Jay Jones’s authoritative biography —is in evidence from his earliest work. In his senior year of high school, Henson got a job puppeteering for a local TV series. By 1955, he had created “Sam and Friends,” along with his college classmate Jane Nebel, who would become his wife. The five-minute show aired twice a day on WRC-TV, the NBC affiliate in Washington, D.C., and starred a humanoid puppet named Sam. One of his pals was Kermit, who wasn’t yet a frog. Originally an abstract creature of turquoise hue, Kermit was constructed from a sliced Ping-Pong ball and a swatch of Henson’s mother’s old coat. Henson wanted to rethink puppetry for television, and one of his major innovations was to construct Kermit not out of wood (like theatrical marionette puppets) but from cloth, which allowed him to contort Kermit’s face into a range of expressions, subtle enough for the camera to pick up.

The original Kermit was also voiceless. Many of the “Sam and Friends” skits involved lip-synching to popular songs. The one on view at the museum shows Sam and Kermit crooning along to “That Old Black Magic.” Kermit, performed by Nebel and outfitted with a sleek black bob, takes the Keely Smith part. He’s weirdly disembodied, but funny. The camera pulls back to reveal that the whole thing is a misbegotten ad for Esskay Quality meats, with a mustachioed Muppet executive chiding, “You’re all getting sloppy on your delivery.”

Advertisements were Henson’s early form of exposure, and another screen shows some of his brilliant eight-second Wilkins Coffee commercials, made between 1957 and 1969. They featured two characters, Wilkins and Wontkins. When Wontkins refuses the coffee, Wilkins dispatches him in some absurdly violent manner, like shooting him with a cannonball or blowing him up with dynamite. The Muppet taste for mayhem (and for explosions) is there from the start.

Henson pulled back on commercials after the success of “Sesame Street,” which premièred in 1969 and gave his characters an educational mission. But the sinister humor of the Wilkins commercials carried over to “The Muppet Show,” which began in 1976 and borrowed the format of a variety show. It had two different pilots, one of them titled “The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence,” hosted not by Kermit but by a beige fellow called Nigel (also on view at the museum).

Once Kermit took over, he became the heart and soul of the Muppets: an earnest, beleaguered ringmaster around whom the wackier characters revolved. (Like Henson himself, Kermit had a nonconfrontational management style that both inspired and frustrated his charges.) It was a dynamic that Henson absorbed from Pogo, the Walt Kelly comic strip of his youth. “Kermit is the Pogo,” Henson once said. “You have one normal person who represents the way people ordinarily think. And everything else, slightly crazier comedy characters are all around that person.” One of those characters, of course, was Miss Piggy, played by Oz, who moved from a background part into the spotlight and never let go.

Almost as soon as Henson landed “The Muppet Show,” he started dreaming of the movies. “The Muppet Movie” came out in 1979 and gave us the indelible image of Kermit in a swamp strumming a banjo and singing “The Rainbow Connection.” (Henson performed it from an underwater diving bell, with his arm sticking up through a rubber sleeve.) But the worldwide success of the Muppets made him restless still, and in the eighties he alternated between lucrative Muppet projects and gothic fantasies like “The Dark Crystal” and “Labyrinth,” which were less crowd-pleasing but more technically ambitious.

As Jones’s book details, Henson continually resisted that which made him most famous, including his reputation as a children’s entertainer. In one gallery room called “Experiments,” we see a prototype of an unrealized brainstorm from the late sixties called “Cyclia,” a multimedia night club where film would project onto the body of a live dancer. There’s also Henson’s psychedelic short film “Time Piece” (1965), which was nominated for an Academy Award and has not a puppet in sight. Instead, you see rapid cuts of surreal images, among them Henson dressed as Abraham Lincoln and painting an elephant pink.

It all adds up to a dizzying portrait of imagination. Henson was the rare artist who invented an entire creative world—and then sought out new materials to construct it. But let’s be honest: if you come to a Jim Henson exhibit, you want to see Kermit. He’s there, all right, seated on a white cube, his right arm held up in a friendly wave. It’s a model from circa 1974, made from “fleece fabric, felt, plastic, rubber, and self-adhesive vinyl,” according the label. Below, there’s a quote from Henson: “Kermit is the closest to me. . . . The character is literally my hand.” No wonder he’s been tricky to extract. That hand, like the man, has a long reach."
483,http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/24/the-life-of-a-south-central-statistic,newyorker,The Life of a South Central Statistic,[],"We, who are in prison, had to answer for our sins and our lives were taken from us. Our bodies became the property of the state of California. We are reduced to numbers and stripped of our identity. To the state of California I am not Michael Alexander Allen but I am K-10033. When they want to know anything about me they do not type my last name in the computer but it is my number that is inputted. My number is my name. . . . Dante was not in hell due to a fatal sin but somewhere in his life he strayed onto the path of error, away from his true self. I, K-10033, strayed away from my true self: Michael Alexander Allen.

What sets the course of a life? Three years before my beloved cousin’s murder—before the weeping, before the raging, before the heated self-recriminations and icy reckonings—I awoke with the most glorious sense of anticipation I’ve ever felt. It was June 29, 2006, the day that Michael was going to be freed. Outside my vacation condo in Hollywood, I climbed into the old white BMW I’d bought from my mother and headed to my aunt’s small stucco home, in South Central. On the corner, a fortified drug house stood like a sentry, but her pale cottage seemed serene, aglow in the morning sun. Poverty never looks quite as bad in the City of Angels as it does elsewhere. Aunt Karen, my father’s youngest sister, then drove a crew of us to collect Michael from the California Rehabilitation Center-Norco, which lies on a dusty stretch of Riverside County. Michael, the youngest of her three kids, was born when I was eight years old. I had grown up with him. The baby of a sprawling family, he was also my baby, a child of magnetizing energy and good humor. We had lost him eleven years earlier, when he was arrested, at fifteen, for an attempted carjacking. Now we’d get him back. It felt like a resurrection. At the parking lot for Tower 8, a white van drove up to deposit the prisoners being released. Michael stepped out, saw us, and smiled. His broad, toothy grin took up half his face, a bright flash of white against his dark skin. He had a little bob in his step, the same natural spring he’d had as a child. His late adolescence and early adulthood had been spent in captivity, yet he bounded toward us like a fawn. The homecoming party was in the driveway of my aunt’s house, next to the postage stamp of a lawn. Uncles and friends, cousins and second cousins, and cousins who knows how many times removed pulled folding chairs up to folding tables, which were covered with paper tablecloths and laden with fried chicken and sweet tea. The merriment continued all afternoon, and seemed to attract some attention from the neighbors. More than once, a glamorous-looking woman drove past, slowly, in a low-slung two-door gold Mercedes sports car. Michael feasted and played Football Manager with the nephews and nieces who had been born while he was in prison. After the party, we had little time to waste. That summer, I was telecommuting to my job as the dean of the humanities at the University of Chicago. Michael, for his part, was intent on making something of himself. He had spent some time as a firefighter when he was at Norco, and he was ready to rebuild his life. Making that happen, managing his reëntry in the months to come, was my job. Not mine alone, but mine consistently, day after day, as the cousin on duty, the one with resources, the one who had been to college and who had become a professional. The plans we had were not the plans we had hoped to have. Michael should have been paroled to a fire camp or to a fire station in Riverside County, where we had family who were ready to take him in. He could have lived there and gone to school and kept on beating back wildfires. But the rule was that you had to be paroled to the county where your offense was committed—crime-ridden Los Angeles County, in his case. So we developed the best alternatives we could. We made task lists, and moved through them efficiently. We met the parole officer, opened a bank account, and went to the library, where Michael got a card and started learning how to use a computer. (Google hadn’t existed when he went to prison.) At the D.M.V., he took a test and got his driver’s license. Then, under the scorching sun of the deadliest California heat wave in nearly sixty years, we returned each day to the cool library and scoured Web sites for jobs. We focussed on large chains, which would have room for advancement, and sent out a lot of applications. Most of the time, Michael never got a reply. Then he caught a break: Sears invited him to a job interview. One morning in late July, he donned a new pair of khaki trousers and a button-down shirt, and we headed to Hollywood, to Santa Monica and Western. It was the perfect opportunity—but also, to me, a fraught one. A man who had been imprisoned for more than a decade would have to make the case that he ought to be hired. We had practiced bits and pieces of his story, but never the whole thing. In fact, I never heard Michael recount his own tale from start to finish. I wonder now whether this was because the full version would have led me to ask questions that Michael did not want to answer. He had so much to give—stories, reflection, engagement—that somehow none of us ever noticed just how much he was withholding. He could love everybody on the terms on which they needed to be loved, give everybody what they needed to receive; and so, in the end, none of us really knew him. I’ve come to realize that he didn’t quite know himself, either.

The trouble began in preadolescence. His mother got married to a man who had kept from her the fact that he had a criminal record, and who soon became abusive. Karen took her children to Mississippi and then to southern Georgia. There, a few months shy of twelve, Michael stole a jar of coins, amounting to something under ten dollars, from a white family across the street. He was starting to want things, impatiently, and he was also naïve, a California kid transplanted to the Deep South. Only out of naïveté could he have thought to steal from a white family in southern Georgia. Rather than telling Karen and asking for the money back, the family pressed charges. It was Michael’s first encounter with the law, and he went to court with his mother. Karen had by then filed for divorce and bought plane tickets to California. The judge told her the charges would be dropped so long as they got on the plane and never came back. In the fall of 1991, Michael and his family moved to Claremont, where my father, William, taught, and where my mother, Susan, worked as a college librarian. For my cousins, my parents’ house was a second home, screened with laurel bushes, framed by pink-blossomed crêpe myrtles, and shaded by a spreading loquat tree in front. “Everything is dandy—and our intestinal biomes are joyous.” William and Karen—children of a Florida fisherman who became a charismatic Baptist preacher—were close, but their courses in life were not. My father, with the encouragement of a grade-school teacher, was academically ambitious, and he turned into a pipe-smoking, NPR-listening professor, a political scientist who chaired the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. He spent much of his days amid heaps of paper in a book-filled study, orchestral harmonies from the radio perfumed by the tweedy, comforting smell of pipe tobacco. Karen’s story was different; she worked for a time as a certified nursing assistant, but bringing up three young kids while working full time was a struggle. Her ex-husband wasn’t the first abusive man she had been involved with, and plans for furthering her education were often derailed. Now, with my brother and me away at college, my parents helped Karen find an apartment a few blocks away. Michael took piano lessons from a stern, diminutive woman who had been my own teacher and who taught us how to sit up straight, “like the Queen of England.” Michael earned money gardening for her, but resented the hectoring lessons about life that she delivered as he weeded. He was becoming something of a rule breaker in Claremont. He and his new friend Adam were caught stealing chocolate-chip cookies from the school cafeteria, and sometimes had to be separated after making noise in class. Michael was also caught shoplifting at a nearby mall. Luckily, the store owner delivered Michael to my father, not to the police. But Michael’s pattern of petty theft worried his mother, and my father; the weeding job was meant to deal with his need for money. Then, in early 1993, a fire swept through the family’s apartment complex, and they moved again, to the L.A. neighborhood of Inglewood. Although the area was scarred from the ravages of the previous year’s riots, the move meant that Karen could be closer to her new job, at an organization called Homeless Health Care Los Angeles. It also meant that Michael started a new school year in yet another district. We know something about his experiences as a student, because the State of California surveyed its youth during the 1993-94 school year. Forty per cent of ninth graders reported being in a physical fight; nearly sixty per cent reported seeing someone at school with a weapon. Gangs filled in for family; almost one in five ninth graders reported belonging to one at some point. Michael, then just shy of fourteen, seems to have flirted with the Queen Street Bloods, who were active on the west side of Inglewood; later, he started hanging with a friend from the Crips, a rival gang. Michael was testing out a new world. But in that summer of 1993 he would also return to his old one, riding a bus back to Claremont to hang out with Adam. During one of those visits, Adam’s parents were looking after the next-door neighbor’s house, and the two boys let themselves in and took a radio and some other items. The neighbor reported a burglary, and when Karen realized who was responsible she hauled Michael to the police station. The boys returned everything. They were given a two-year juvenile probation, which entailed a curfew but no court date. The narrative so far is familiar. A kid from a troubled home, trapped in poverty, without a stable world of adults coördinating care for him, starts pilfering, mostly out of an impatience to have things. In Michael’s first fourteen years, his story includes not a single incidence of violence, aside from the usual wrestling matches with siblings. It could have had any number of possible endings. But events unfold along a single track. As we make decisions, and decisions are made for us, we shed the lives that might have been. In Michael’s fifteenth year, his life accelerated, like a cylinder in one of those pneumatic tubes, whisking off your deposit at a drive-through bank. To understand how that acceleration could happen, though, another story is needed. • Like Dante I am forced to descend lower into hell to achieve a full awakening. I am forced into depression, scarred by obscenities, war after war, but each war that I survive I am a step closer to a full awakening of self. My hell is no longer demonstrating what I am capable of doing in order to survive. It has become what I can tolerate and withstand in order to live.

Consider the visible surface of Los Angeles. Underpasses, bridges, alleyways, delivery trucks, service entrances, corner stores, mailboxes, water towers, exhaust vents, and the streets—in the nineties, at least, all were covered with graffiti. Few can read that graffiti. I couldn’t then, and have only now begun to learn how to decipher it. But it’s a language that represents a world. It records deaths and transactions, benefactions and trespasses, favors done and owed, vendettas pursued. Laws and punishments. If you can’t read that graffiti, you have no conception of the parallel universe, all around you, that is fundamentally at war with the legally recognized state. It’s a regime with its own rules and penalties—in effect, a parastate. Michael grew up there. Behind that parastate’s economy and criminal-justice system lies the war on drugs. In the eighties, as the state sought to break the global drug-supply chain by rounding up low-level peddlers and deterring them with outsized penalties, the wholesalers established their own system of deterrence for gang members who served as retailers. If you didn’t do what you were supposed to do, you were shot. Maybe in the knee first. If you riled the gang system again, you or someone you loved might be killed. The drug business, dependent on a well-established witness-suppression program, operates a far more powerful system of deterrence, with far swifter punishment, than any lawful state could ever devise. In these years, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department created its first gang database. In 1988, after a much publicized drive-by shooting of a bystander, near U.C.L.A., the Los Angeles Police Department used the database to round up no fewer than fourteen hundred African-American youths and detain them in the parking lot of the L.A. Coliseum. More than eighteen thousand people were jailed in six months. Between 1982 and 1995, the African-American prison population in California grew from 12,470 to 42,296; the Latino prison population soared from 9,006 to 46,080. Los Angeles was a city ready to explode when the four police officers who had been caught on video beating Rodney King were acquitted. When Michael stole the jar of coins in Georgia, and the judge dropped the charges, you might say that Michael met the “forgiving world.” The same happened when he shoplifted, and when he stole the radio in Claremont, in 1993. But, back in the City of Angels, Michael met the unforgiving world. Nearly half the black men in Los Angeles between the ages of twenty-one and twenty-four were officially identified as gang members, and this simple fact of classification, accurate or not, affected that community profoundly. The angels had turned their backs. The summer before Michael’s junior year, in 1995, he began looking for a job. His cousin Marc—my younger brother—had worked in a grocery store as a bag boy throughout high school, and Michael wanted a similar gig. But, at fifteen, he needed a work permit, and nobody in his mother’s social network could help. He again began to roam the streets, and stayed out past his curfew. In math class, his grades plunged from straight A’s to an F. Karen had conferences with Michael and his teachers, who told him that he was smarter than this. He countered, “I don’t want to be smarter than this.” On those warm summer days, he spent as much time as he could out-of-doors. Sometimes he would stand in front of the house of a kid he’d come to know. Karen spotted him once, lean and muscled, standing shirtless in khaki trousers—gangbanging gear. Although he was only four blocks away from her apartment, it felt like a different neighborhood. the relative best equipped to guide Michael’s reëntry. Photograph by Matthew Tammaro for The New Yorker Karen’s last day with her boy was Friday, September 15th. Michael didn’t have school. He went to work with his mother and hung out in her office. Then she took him to the Los Angeles Public Library, where she planned to meet him when she got off work, to take him shopping. But Michael was gone when she returned. The next time she saw him, he was in handcuffs.

Where were you when you were fifteen? When I close my eyes, I can still see a bedroom with a brass bed topped with a blue-and-white striped Laura Ashley comforter. There were matching valences on my windows, and I had a wooden rolltop desk, with a drawer that locked and held my secrets, including dirty letters that I couldn’t at the time translate from a German boy with whom I’d had a minor romance at summer music camp. I grew up in a college town where everyone knew my parents. They had made a critical decision, early in the lives of their two children, not to move until we had graduated from high school. I was a faculty brat, an insecure and often lonely child; the only time I ever got grounded was when my mother caught me sneaking a ride to French class with a friend. I was younger than most of my classmates at Claremont High School, and, although my friends all had their driver’s licenses by the start of our junior year and I didn’t, I wasn’t allowed to ride in their cars. Eight years later, in L.A., my fifteen-year-old cousin, who also didn’t yet have a driver’s license, was arrested, for the first time, for an attempted carjacking. It was September 17, 1995, a cool and foggy Sunday morning. Larry Smith, a lanky forty-four-year-old, was buffing the dashboard of his blue Cadillac Coupe de Ville in the alley behind his apartment, on Rosecrans Avenue. The street was lined with drab stucco apartment buildings, whose uncovered staircases led down to carports below. Michael appeared holding a chrome Lorcin .380, a cheap pistol prone to malfunction. An older friend, Devonn, a member of the Rollin 60s Crips, was apparently on lookout, but not visible to Smith as he worked in his car. (Both names have been changed.) Michael approached Smith, told him not to move, and demanded his watch. Smith handed it over. Then Michael asked for his wallet. When he found that it was empty, he tossed it back into the car. Then, as the police report recounted, Michael “tapped Smith’s left knee with the gun and said he was going to take the car.” According to Smith, Michael kept the gun pointed at the ground. Smith lunged for the weapon. They wrestled. Michael punched him. Smith gained control of the gun and shot Michael through the neck. As Michael lay bleeding on the ground, Smith hollered to his wife to call 911. When the police arrived, they collected evidence and looked for witnesses, although no one had anything to say. Meanwhile, paramedics took Michael to a hospital, where he was treated for a “through and through” bullet wound that had narrowly missed his spine. A police officer accompanying Michael in the ambulance reported that, “during transport, Allen made a spontaneous statement that he was robbing a man when he got shot.” At the hospital, Michael was read his Miranda rights and additional juvenile admonishments in the presence of a second officer. According to the police report, he waived his rights and said again that he had tried to rob the man, using a gun that he claimed he had found about two and a half weeks earlier. He also confessed that he had robbed three people during the previous two days on the same block, and that he had robbed someone a week earlier, about ten blocks away. The police had no reports for two of the four robberies he confessed to; in the two that had been reported, Michael had taken twenty dollars from one victim and two dollars from another. In other words, on his way to the hospital, and upon admission, with no adults present other than the officers, a wounded fifteen-year-old talked a blue streak. By the time Karen got to Michael’s bedside, he had wrapped up his confession. The only thing he didn’t mention was Devonn’s involvement. Did Devonn suggest the crime, or provide the gun? We have no way of knowing. I don’t believe that Michael was prepared, that morning, to be violent; he had a gun, but refrained from using it. Still, I was far away, a graduate student in England. Along the banks of the River Cam, I shared poems with friends and debated crime and punishment in ancient Athens. I had gravitated toward the subject upon being struck by how a sophisticated, democratic society had made next to no use of imprisonment. When the news of Michael’s arrest came, it was stupefying. My brain raced in endless loops. How could it be ? How could it be ? I now have a sense of an answer. But there were harder questions ahead. • I’m trapped in a hell with whom society decrees to be the worst of living and better off dead. Robbers, rapists, child molesters, carjackers, murderers, and dope fiends who would spend their mother’s monthly rent for a quick fix. And here I am, amongst them. As much as the mere thought disgusts me, I am one of them. Just another number, not deserving of a second chance.

Before his arrest, Michael did not have a criminal record. That day, he gained one with a vengeance. For the watch and the wallet, Michael was charged with robbery; for the car, attempted carjacking. Both charges were “enhanced” because of the gun. He was also charged with the two earlier robberies. Four felonies, two from one incident, and all in one week. Eighteen months earlier, in March, 1994, California’s Three Strikes and You’re Out law, the nation’s first, had gone into effect. Once you were convicted of your third felony, it meant twenty-five years to life, or a plea deal. If Michael pursued a jury trial, convictions on at least three of his four charges would trigger the law. Worse, this was happening at the high point of L.A.’s panic about carjackings. In Los Angeles County alone, the number of carjackings had nearly doubled between 1991 and 1992, from 3,600 to 6,297. In 1993, the state legislature had unanimously passed a bill that made carjacking an offense for which sixteen-year-olds could be tried as adults. Two years later, the bar was lowered to fourteen. A Los Angeles Times article titled “Wave of Fear,” which ran the year before Michael’s arrest, quoted then Senator Joseph Biden saying, “Name me a person in L.A. who has a fender-bender and doesn’t fear an imminent carjacking. Yes, it’s still remote, but you’re in the statistical pool now. It’s like AIDS . Everyone’s in the pool now.” California’s legislators had given up on the idea of rehabilitation in prison, even for juveniles. This is a point that critics of the penal system make all the time. Here is what they don’t say: legislators had also given up on retribution. Anger drives retribution. When the punishment fits the crime, retribution is achieved, and anger is sated; it softens. This is what makes it anger, not hatred, a distinction recognized by philosophers all the way back to antiquity. Retribution limits how much punishment you can impose. “Mommy and Daddy still love you, but we’re going to try living thirteen inches apart for a while.” The legislators who voted to try as adults sixteen-year-olds, and then fourteen-year-olds, were not interested in retribution. They had become deterrence theorists. They were designing sentences not for people but for a thing: the aggregate level of crime. They wanted to reduce that level, regardless of what constituted justice for any individual involved. The target of Michael’s sentence was not a bright fifteen-year-old boy with a mild proclivity for theft but the thousands of carjackings that occurred in Los Angeles. Deterrence dehumanizes. It directs at the individual the full hatred that society understandably has for an aggregate phenomenon. But no individual should bear that kind of responsibility. On February 5, 1996, four and a half months after Michael’s last night at home, he sat in court, in an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs, as the judge told him to choose whether to stand trial and face a possible conviction of twenty-five years to life or to plead guilty and take a reduced sentence. The judge didn’t say how much the sentence would be reduced, but he did say, “Please take the plea.” Michael could not choose. Now sixteen, he asked his mother to decide. Karen went outside the courtroom and prayed. “God told me,” she says, “that he would only get seven years, versus risking a trial of twenty-five years to life. I made the decision.” So Michael pleaded guilty. A few months later, he learned that his “earliest possible release date” was June 29, 2006. According to Karen, the only time Michael cried in court was when he got sentenced. When you’re sixteen, the farthest back you can remember is about thirteen years, to the age of three. Michael’s sentence was almost equivalent, in psychological terms, to the whole of his life. It stretched past what was for him the limit of knowable time. The mind cannot fasten onto this sort of temporality; we are unable to give it concrete meaning in relation to our own lives. The imagination wanders into white space. For Michael, it was, he later wrote, “a mountain of time” to climb. It would be a steep one. The moment he turned seventeen, he was transferred to adult prison. “How could it have happened?” is the question everyone asks. Where were the lawyers? What did your family do? I think back to the stolen radio. Michael came from a family who believed that if you did something wrong you admitted it, you fixed it, and you suffered the consequences. Michael was guilty of the attempted carjacking; he was going to have to suffer the consequences. Our family trusted in the fairness of the criminal-justice system. At each turn, we learned too late that this system was no longer what we thought it was, that its grip was mercilessly tightening, that our son would be but one among many millions soon lost in its vise. When we read that the point of the Three Strikes law is to lock up repeat offenders, we do not think of the fifteen-year-old who has just been arrested for the first time. An underground nuclear test is conducted, and the land above craters only much later. This, I think, describes the effect of the Three Strikes law and the slow, constant escalation of penal severity. An explosion occurred underground. The people standing on the surface conducted their lives as usual. They figured out what was really going on only after the earth had collapsed beneath them.

The years between the ages of fifteen and twenty-six are punctuated by familiar milestones: high school, driver’s license, college, first love, first job, first serious relationship, perhaps marriage, possibly a child. For those who pass adolescence in prison, some of these rites disappear; the ones that occur take on a distorted shape. And extra milestones get added. First long-term separation from family. First racial melee. First time in solitary, formally known as “administrative segregation.” First time sodomized. Between his arrest and his sentencing, Michael was mainly in Central, the juvenile prison, where only parents and legal guardians could visit. When Michael and I reconnected properly, in the late nineties, he was making his way through Chino—a notoriously tough prison—before landing in Norco. Its full name was the California Rehabilitation Center-Norco, but little rehabilitation was on offer. There was the obligatory library, but no classes past the G.E.D. level. In the nineties, college and university classes were scrapped because of budget cuts, and the state and federal governments ceased providing prisoners access to Pell Grants for correspondence courses. Higher education, once seen as an antidote to recidivism, had come to be seen as a privilege that inmates hadn’t earned. After I started teaching at the University of Chicago, in 1998, Michael and I began talking regularly on the phone. Once he was at Norco, I began to visit him, too, every other week in the summer and during the Christmas holidays. Michael would call at least once a week, sometimes more, except when the prison was on lockdown owing to outbreaks of violence. Then weeks might pass without a word. I was a good phone partner, because I could afford the astronomical collect-call charges. Every call began with a reminder, a robotic voice saying, “This is the California Department of Corrections. Will you accept the charges?” And then, every fifteen seconds, as if we could forget, there was another interruption: “This call has originated from a California state prison.” Michael, who had already completed his G.E.D., desperately wanted to go to college, and I understood his desire to learn. I believed in education; I believed in Michael. So I researched how Michael might be able to get a college degree. On November 8, 2001, Michael sent me his application to Indiana University’s Program in General Studies, and I mailed it with a check nine days later. He would aim for a bachelor’s degree. The day he was admitted was as exhilarating as the day I received my fat envelope from Princeton, thirteen years earlier. There was a catch, however. No hardcover books were allowed into the prison. Michael could enroll only in classes for which the textbooks had soft covers. I made a round of phone calls. The remaining choices for introductory classes were Intro to Ethics and Intro to Writing and Study of Literature. Michael chose the second, Lit 141. I paid the fees and ordered the books. New Year’s came and so did the Bible, the Odyssey, the Inferno, “The Canterbury Tales,” and “Persian Letters.” But there was no shortage of distractions, and Michael had trouble completing the assignments. At one point, suspected of participating in a “racial melee,” he was transferred to Chino and placed in solitary, until an investigation absolved him. A year later, he repeated the class. This time he churned out one essay after another, with readings that were full of insight and personal connection to ancient texts. He was finding his voice. “I don’t take kindly to seeing myself in Hell but Dante’s writing makes it impossible to just read without visualization,” he wrote in one essay. “It is the life I live in Prison which to me is Hell. . . . I think of Dante’s use of ice as nothing but a mere deception. Ice within itself is enticing to the burning soul. Ice can get so cold that it burns flesh. And it’s parallel to any sin committed on earth.” “All right, boys, we’ve had our fun.” Along the way, Michael fell in love. I remember his words on the phone: “I’ve met someone, Danielle. She’s beautiful.” And I remember my sense of confusion. Met someone? How? Where? I was thinking of the female guards whom I’d got to know in the course of my visits. But in a fumbling way we came to understand each other. Michael had fallen in love with a fellow-inmate who had implants or hormone-induced breasts, and who dressed and lived as Bree. (I’ve changed the name.) She was, he said, unquestionably the most beautiful woman in the prison. He hadn’t told his mother, and he made me promise not to say anything. He knew Karen would be upset and he feared she would judge him, as he trusted I would not. Like freedom, desire was dizzying to Michael. A month later, he mailed me a piece of writing unlike anything he had ever sent me. “The world has change and brothas far from the same,” he rapped, and continued: Am I losing my mind No; I think I found it Realizing greatness in one’s self is very astounding and truth be told, I recognize a King cause when I look in the mirror all I see is me And us, so please trust, we can’t be touch standing together forever is a necessary must. Soon afterward, he sent me Bree’s annual prison shot. She was posed as a woman, lying on the floor like a sports pinup, made up and in colorful clothing. Why did he love her? He loved her because she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. He loved her because, of all the men in prison, she had chosen him—and that was a gift of surpassing value. But it was also a gift that came to blind him. When he was finally released from prison, I failed to grasp that he was not yet free.

Upstairs, in the Sears personnel department, everything was beige and brightly lit. I settled into a metal chair and waited while Michael had his interview, in an office down the hall. I did a lot of waiting that summer, but I never questioned why I was there. My brother and I had long ago formed a tight circle with Aunt Karen’s three kids—Nicholas, Roslyn, and Michael, each born about two years apart—and, as the oldest, I was always the one in charge. As I waited, I typically spent my time thinking about my task lists, about what had to be done next. Forty-five minutes into this particular wait, the door opened and I learned that the managers had offered Michael a job as an inventory clerk. It felt as if time had begun. I could imagine a future, even a happy ending. There was still school and housing to be arranged, but we were steadily assembling the pieces of a possible life, as if doing a jigsaw puzzle. The goal was for Michael to work full time and to enroll in one of California’s famed community colleges. No one in his immediate family had a degree, but I was in my element—pretty much my deepest expertise was in going to school. Los Angeles Valley College, in Valley Glen, was the obvious place, a decent school with good general-education courses and—our goal—a fire-technology program. The subway’s Red Line had stops at Santa Monica and Vermont, about a mile from the Sears, and in North Hollywood, not too far from campus. We battled our way through the thicket of federal financial-aid forms, visited the tutoring center, and hungrily collected flyers posting apartments for rent. We needed a place cheap enough to manage on Michael’s wages. Together, we searched the listings, drove by addresses, and made calls and appointments. We landed on a promising place on Ethel Avenue, in Valley Glen, a few blocks north of the college. The advertisement was for a studio apartment in a converted garage behind a modest home. Once again, Michael practiced telling his story, and we scheduled a visit. The home was impeccable, a white bungalow circled by a white iron fence. Alongside the fence stood some small shrubs, neatly tended, and rosebushes spraying white flowers. I went up to the house by myself. Two women met me at the door, a mother, perhaps in her sixties, and her daughter. Dressed in linen trousers and a black T-shirt, I introduced myself. I was a professor, I told them, and I was helping my cousin, who had recently been released from prison. He had just enrolled at Los Angeles Valley College and been hired at Sears. I would be paying his deposit and guaranteeing his rent. He’d been sentenced as a young person and this was his second chance. Were they willing to meet him and hear him out? They agreed, and I sat outside while Michael spoke to his prospective landlords. He could charm anyone with that bouncing gait and electric grin. Finally, the three emerged, in good spirits, and the women took us around to the back to see the studio. It was clean and peaceful, and equipped with a hot plate and an electric heater. I could imagine being comfortable there. And it was walking distance from the school. Michael said he wanted it; we all shook hands in the gaze of the late-afternoon sun. I was moved by the trust and the generosity of these two women, and I still am. Driving back to South Central, my mood was all melody. I imagined Michael felt the same. Little more than a month out and here he was, with a driver’s license, a bank account, a library card, and a job. He was enrolled in college, with a clean, safe, comfortable place to live. This was a starter set for a life, enabling him to defy the pattern of parolees. “Look, I did bring you in here for questioning. I want to know if you like my new tie.” I dropped him off in South Central and headed back to Hollywood, expecting to sleep soundly for the first time in a while. But that night Michael called. He wasn’t sure he should take the apartment. I felt a stone drop to the bottom of a well. Why not? I asked. He couldn’t explain, he said. He just didn’t feel quite right about it. I told him to sleep on it, and when we talked in the morning he told me he wanted the apartment after all. Relieved, I headed off to collect a cashier’s check for the security deposit, and Michael headed off under yet another cloudless sky to his job at Sears. At midday, he called me again: Had I taken the check over yet? He said that he had changed his mind again. “Michael, what on earth are you talking about?” He told me that he wasn’t sure what it would be like if his associates came by. The word surprised me, but I didn’t ask him what he meant by “associates.” The purpose of the word, somehow, was to insist on his privacy, and it brought me up short. I paused, didn’t ask questions. I told him to think about it some more. Disagreement was rare for us. He called me a few hours later. He said he would take the apartment and asked me to pick him up after work. Then, just before I did so, he called again. “I’ve made up my mind,” he said. “I don’t want the apartment.” My memory of the conversation is hazy, but it’s likely we exchanged some sharp words. His plan, it emerged, was to live with his mother and to ride the bus the nine miles from there to Sears and the ten miles from there to Los Angeles Valley College, and then the twenty-two miles home—through the worst of Los Angeles traffic. It was madness, but there was nothing I could do. It was well into August. School would start soon. I would have incoming students to welcome, new faculty to orient, budgets to plan. I bought him more khakis and button-down shirts, spent as much time with him as I could. A few weeks later, I headed back to Chicago. • The root of sin is lust and the desire to satisfy that lust. . . . Lust only creates wanting and wanting creates greed and greed burns Flesh. It is lust that causes us to believe we have to have something at all cost. This is my suffering, this is my hell. 24 hours all night. There is no day. My soul in its entirety is in darkness.

The jigsaw puzzle soon fell apart, and college was the first piece to go. The commute was just too much; I doubt Michael made it through even two weeks of classes. The job, meanwhile, lasted until November, when I got a nearly hysterical call. Michael said he couldn’t do it. He was drowning. He wasn’t going to make it. When I left L.A., I had promised him that if he ever needed me I would be there. After the call, I went straight to the airport, and arrived in L.A. just in time to take him to dinner. Michael was teary and despondent. After work, he said, some of his Latino co-workers had called him a nigger. He fought them in the parking lot, and walked away from the job. Never told his bosses or co-workers that he was quitting—just didn’t return. So now he was back to square one. Worse than that, really, since he’d proved himself unreliable to an employer. He was mostly spending his time at home, playing video games with his nephews. He no longer saw a future for himself. I mainly tried to listen; I didn’t have much to offer. I could promise to get him into an apartment, if he could get another job. But I was no longer in a position to stay and help him find one. I had too many obligations in Chicago. November was tenure-review time, with mounds of papers to read and unending cycles of meetings that the dean, in particular, was not supposed to miss. My professional reputation was at stake. Michael would have to make the next push for himself. When I visited L.A. just before the winter break, it seemed as if Michael had made that push. He had found an apartment, he told me, and was ready to put down a deposit. Could I come and see it? The place was on the fourth floor of a vintage Craftsman-style building overlooking the 101 freeway. It was big and spacious, with gleaming wood floors. As I wound through the rooms, Michael began telling me about how he and Bree wanted to move in. I had no idea he was still seeing Bree, let alone making plans to move in together. My face must have conveyed surprise, though I tried not to react too strongly. (Learning how to suppress visible emotion is an occupational demand of being a dean.) I told him that I wanted to know what the job situation was. Had he lined up a new gig? What did Bree do—did she have a job? Our voices echoed in the empty apartment. Michael leaned against a windowsill, the sky and the freeway shining behind him. There was something shamefaced in him as he answered. No, he didn’t have a job. Bree was into hair styling, but, no, she didn’t have one, either. What, exactly, were they thinking? Michael didn’t have much of an answer. Plainly, the plan involved taking advantage of me to some degree. In that moment, I encountered a different Michael from the one I knew. I saw something calculating, something I’d never seen before. I didn’t ask to talk to Bree, whom I’d come to realize was the woman in the gold Mercedes crawling past our homecoming party. All I was able to say was that I couldn’t possibly pay the deposit—plus some number of months’ rent, plus co-sign a lease—when neither of them had a job. Michael’s face tensed. He said he understood. This was the day I understood that the idea that I could stand my baby cousin up on his own two feet was a fantasy; it had always had too much of me in it. From this point on, Michael ceased confiding in me. Our phone conversations never burrowed below the surface. I no longer knew how to help. Michael spent more and more time with Bree, whose possessiveness was violent. According to Karen, Bree cut Michael three times between December and May, and each time Michael tried to pass the injuries off as the result of someone attempting to rob him. He had also begun to suspect Bree of cheating. Late one night, he sneaked under her window, in the hope—he told me later—that catching her in the act would give him an easy out from the relationship. That night, he got into a fight with a lover of Bree’s, and the police were called. Michael went straight to prison for a parole violation, and remained there for around a year. It was a catastrophic defeat. Despite the fact that we wrote each other letters, I somehow obliterated from my memory all traces of Michael’s second stint in prison. When he got out again, just months before the 2008 stock-market crash, he returned to what we hoped would be the comfort of his mother’s house. Just a short time later, though, he began living with Bree. In the months before Michael’s parole violation, Karen and Bree had waged a battle rooted in a strong mutual dislike. Now Bree sought a formal treaty. She called Karen to say that Michael would be living with her, and that she didn’t want any conflict. This was hard for Karen. She knew that her son’s relationship was violent. As Karen understood it, Bree had been in prison for attempting to kill a boyfriend, and the only time she had seen Michael get physical with anyone was when he fought Bree on her pin-neat front lawn. Bree had been going down the street, breaking car windows and throwing things at Karen’s house. Michael had gone outside to warn her away. The two came to blows. Through a window, Karen saw Michael knock Bree out. That night, Karen added to her prayers the hope that the Lord would liberate Michael from his misery. By December, Michael’s world had fully contracted. While living at Bree’s house, he became known on the street as Big Mike. That winter, he revealed to his sister a gun, hidden in a towel, in Bree’s Mercedes. By the spring, he was running drugs, including at least one trip to Texas. Later, the detectives investigating his murder found PCP in his room. In June, 2009, I got married, in New Jersey, where I had recently accepted an appointment at a distinguished research institute. Michael came to the wedding—his first airplane flight since his release. He was handsome in a beige jacket and crimson shirt, with matching crimson alligator-skin shoes. But there was so much I couldn’t see: I couldn’t make out the demons chasing Michael as he greeted the other guests at the door to the chapel.

Five weeks after that champagne-filled wedding day, my father called me from Maryland with the news: Michael had been discovered in a car in South Los Angeles, dead from multiple gunshots. I was in England, and I remember my father’s voice, the careful, clipped speech of a retired professor, crackling as if through the first transatlantic cables. Heading to the airport, I knew that the police were looking for a woman, and that Bree had disappeared. Two weeks later, she was charged with his murder. “I hate my fans.” She had, evidently, shot Michael in her kitchen. There had been one witness, a middle-school-age boy. He hadn’t seen anything, but he had heard voices and gunshots. With the help of relatives, Bree cleaned Michael up nicely. She then bundled him in a blanket, put him in his little hatchback, and drove him to the street corner where he was found. Three accessories—all members of Bree’s family—were also charged. Eventually, Bree pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter, and was sentenced to twenty-two years in prison. Having by now undergone gender-reassignment surgery, she was sent to a women’s prison. Michael and Bree had first met and become lovers when they were both inmates at Norco, which she had entered at the age of twenty-five. Bree was a little more than two years older than Michael. She was just his height and just his weight, a transgender woman still early in the process of transitioning. As far as the public record reveals, she’d been convicted for assault with a firearm. I thought back to Michael’s homecoming in 2006, to Bree cruising by in her chariot, coming for to carry Michael home. We all had thought the relationship ended when Bree left prison a year ahead of Michael, and we believed that Michael’s home was with us. What Michael himself thought or wanted that homecoming day, I will never know. He hadn’t invited Bree to the picnic. Yet she came and would stay. When Michael contemplated renting that tidy little studio apartment on Ethel Avenue, with its white fence and pearly roses, it was voluptuous Bree in her tight clothes and gold Mercedes whom he was visualizing having to introduce to those kindly landladies. How would it have gone if he had taken this “associate” home with him? When he spent those twenty-four hours dithering over whether to rent the apartment, I see now that his real choice was whether to repudiate the first and only love of his life. He chose Bree, and it would prove to be his life’s defining decision. • There are those who await to fulfill their destiny. I see in them a sincere and apologetic heart for their ill misdeeds. They are the one who will change the world positively or positively change someone’s world. Hell cannot hold the latter of the two opposites but in time will only spit them back out into society to do what is right. The hell that I live in cannot hold Dante. Hell can test and try one’s self but it cannot hold Dante and it will not hold me. In the Inferno , the dead are trapped forever. Surely, the biggest and most important difference in the Inferno and my hell called prison, is that I have a way out."
484,http://www.newyorker.com/news/ryan-lizza/anthony-scaramucci-called-me-to-unload-about-white-house-leakers-reince-priebus-and-steve-bannon,newyorker,"Anthony Scaramucci Called Me to Unload About White House Leakers, Reince Priebus, and Steve Bannon",[],"On Wednesday night, I received a phone call from Anthony Scaramucci, the new White House communications director. He wasn’t happy. Earlier in the night, I’d tweeted , citing a “senior White House official,” that Scaramucci was having dinner at the White House with President Trump, the First Lady, Sean Hannity, and the former Fox News executive Bill Shine. It was an interesting group, and raised some questions. Was Trump getting strategic advice from Hannity? Was he considering hiring Shine? But Scaramucci had his own question—for me.

“Who leaked that to you?” he asked. I said I couldn’t give him that information. He responded by threatening to fire the entire White House communications staff. “What I’m going to do is, I will eliminate everyone in the comms team and we’ll start over,” he said. I laughed, not sure if he really believed that such a threat would convince a journalist to reveal a source. He continued to press me and complain about the staff he’s inherited in his new job. “I ask these guys not to leak anything and they can’t help themselves,” he said. “You’re an American citizen, this is a major catastrophe for the American country. So I’m asking you as an American patriot to give me a sense of who leaked it.”

In Scaramucci’s view, the fact that word of the dinner had reached a reporter was evidence that his rivals in the West Wing, particularly Reince Priebus , the White House chief of staff, were plotting against him. While they have publicly maintained that there is no bad blood between them, Scaramucci and Priebus have been feuding for months. After the election, Trump asked Scaramucci to join his Administration, and Scaramucci sold his company, SkyBridge Capital, in anticipation of taking on a senior role. But Priebus didn’t want him in the White House, and successfully blocked him for being appointed to a job until last week, when Trump offered him the communications job over Priebus’s vehement objections. In response to Scaramucci’s appointment, Sean Spicer, an ally of Priebus’s, resigned his position as press secretary. And in an additional slight to Priebus, the White House’s official announcement of Scaramucci’s hiring noted that he would report directly to the President, rather than to the chief of staff.

Scaramucci’s first public appearance as communications director was a slick and conciliatory performance at the lectern in the White House briefing room last Friday. He suggested it was time for the White House to turn a page. But since then, he has become obsessed with leaks and threatened to fire staffers if he discovers that they have given unauthorized information to reporters. Michael Short, a White House press aide considered close to Priebus, resigned on Tuesday after Scaramucci publicly spoke about firing him. Meanwhile, several damaging stories about Scaramucci have appeared in the press, and he blamed Priebus for most of them. Now, he wanted to know whom I had been talking to about his dinner with the President. Scaramucci, who initiated the call, did not ask for the conversation to be off the record or on background.

“Is it an assistant to the President?” he asked. I again told him I couldn’t say. “O.K., I’m going to fire every one of them, and then you haven’t protected anybody, so the entire place will be fired over the next two weeks.”

I asked him why it was so important for the dinner to be kept a secret. Surely, I said, it would become public at some point. “I’ve asked people not to leak things for a period of time and give me a honeymoon period,” he said. “They won’t do it.” He was getting more and more worked up, and he eventually convinced himself that Priebus was my source.

“They’ll all be fired by me,” he said. “I fired one guy the other day. I have three to four people I’ll fire tomorrow. I’ll get to the person who leaked that to you. Reince Priebus—if you want to leak something—he’ll be asked to resign very shortly.” The issue, he said, was that he believed Priebus had been worried about the dinner because he hadn’t been invited. “Reince is a fucking paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac,” Scaramucci said. He channelled Priebus as he spoke: “ ‘Oh, Bill Shine is coming in. Let me leak the fucking thing and see if I can cock-block these people the way I cock-blocked Scaramucci for six months.’ ” (Priebus did not respond to a request for comment.)

Scaramucci was particularly incensed by a Politico report about his financial-disclosure form, which he viewed as an illegal act of retaliation by Priebus. The reporter said Thursday morning that the document was publicly available and she had obtained it from the Export-Import Bank. Scaramucci didn’t know this at the time, and he insisted to me that Priebus had leaked the document, and that the act was “a felony.”

“I’ve called the F.B.I. and the Department of Justice,” he told me.

“Are you serious?” I asked.

“The swamp will not defeat him,” he said, breaking into the third person. “They’re trying to resist me, but it’s not going to work. I’ve done nothing wrong on my financial disclosures, so they’re going to have to go fuck themselves.”

Scaramucci also told me that, unlike other senior officials, he had no interest in media attention. “I’m not Steve Bannon, I’m not trying to suck my own cock,” he said, speaking of Trump’s chief strategist. “I’m not trying to build my own brand off the fucking strength of the President. I’m here to serve the country.” (Bannon declined to comment.)

He reiterated that Priebus would resign soon, and he noted that he told Trump that he expected Priebus to launch a campaign against him. “He didn’t get the hint that I was reporting directly to the President,” he said. “And I said to the President here are the four or five things that he will do to me.” His list of allegations included leaking the Hannity dinner and the details from his financial-disclosure form.

I got the sense that Scaramucci’s campaign against leakers flows from his intense loyalty to Trump . Unlike other Trump advisers, I’ve never heard him say a bad word about the President. “What I want to do is I want to fucking kill all the leakers and I want to get the President’s agenda on track so we can succeed for the American people,” he told me.

He cryptically suggested that he had more information about White House aides. “O.K., the Mooch showed up a week ago,” he said. “This is going to get cleaned up very shortly, O.K.? Because I nailed these guys. I’ve got digital fingerprints on everything they’ve done through the F.B.I. and the fucking Department of Justice.”

“What?” I interjected.

“Well, the felony, they’re gonna get prosecuted, probably, for the felony.” He added, “The lie detector starts—” but then he changed the subject and returned to what he thought was the illegal leak of his financial-disclosure forms. I asked if the President knew all of this.

“Well, he doesn’t know the extent of all that, he knows about some of that, but he’ll know about the rest of it first thing tomorrow morning when I see him.”

Scaramucci said he had to get going. “Yeah, let me go, though, because I’ve gotta start tweeting some shit to make this guy crazy.”

Minutes later, he tweeted, “In light of the leak of my financial info which is a felony. I will be contacting @FBI and the @TheJusticeDept #swamp @Reince45.” With the addition of Priebus’s Twitter handle, he was making public what he had just told me: that he believed Priebus was leaking information about him. The tweet quickly went viral.

Scaramucci seemed to have second thoughts. Within two hours he deleted the original tweet and posted a new one denying that he was targeting the chief of staff. “Wrong!” he said, adding a screenshot of an Axios article that said, “Scaramucci appears to want Priebus investigated by FBI.” Scaramucci continued, “Tweet was public notice to leakers that all Sr Adm officials are helping to end illegal leaks. @Reince45.”

A few hours later, I appeared on CNN to discuss the overnight drama. As I was talking about Scaramucci, he called into the show himself and referenced our conversation. He changed his story about Priebus. Instead of saying that he was trying to expose Priebus as a leaker, he said that the reason he mentioned Priebus in his deleted tweet was because he wanted to work together with Priebus to discover the leakers.

“He’s the chief of staff, he’s responsible for understanding and uncovering and helping me do that inside the White House, which is why I put that tweet out last night,” Scaramucci said , after noting that he had talked to me Wednesday night. He then made an argument that journalists were assuming that he was accusing Priebus because they know Priebus leaks to the press.

“When I put out a tweet, and I put Reince’s name in the tweet,” he said, “they’re all making the assumption that it’s him because journalists know who the leakers are. So, if Reince wants to explain that he’s not a leaker, let him do that.”

Scaramucci then made a plea to viewers. “Let me tell you something about myself,” he said. “I am a straight shooter.”"
485,http://www.newyorker.com/news/ryan-lizza/sean-spicer-will-be-remembered-for-his-lies,newyorker,Sean Spicer Will Be Remembered for His Lies,[],"Sean Spicer’s resignation, on Friday morning, after six months of routinely lying from the White House lectern and then ending on-camera briefings altogether, once again raises one of the most important questions of the Trump era: What is the red line that Trump must cross for his aides to quit on principle? For Spicer, the answer was a new boss he didn’t like. Trump, over the objections of Spicer and Spicer’s closest White House ally, Reince Priebus, the President’s chief of staff, hired Anthony Scaramucci, a New York financier and frequent Trump surrogate on TV, as his new White House communications director.

The hire is unusual for several reasons. The role of communications director, a job that has been vacant since May, when Michael Dubke, a low-key Republican strategist, resigned from the position, is traditionally reserved for campaign operatives. Scaramucci is a Wall Street guy—he started at Goldman Sachs and later founded his own investment firms—and a former host on the Fox Business channel. Before the Trump campaign, his experience in politics was more on the fund-raising side than on the strategy side. In the Trump campaign, which was small, he took on a broader role as an adviser to the candidate and appeared frequently on TV, where he stood out because he was less ideological than the usual pro-Trump pundits.

More unusual is the way Scaramucci was hired. In a normal White House, the chief of staff is in charge of hiring. For the President to overrule his chief of staff on such an important position is an enormous embarrassment for Priebus. During a briefing on Friday afternoon, Scaramucci tried to downplay the friction between him and Priebus, but for months he has been telling people of his frustrations with the chief of staff. Scaramucci was originally asked to run the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, but Priebus blocked Scaramucci from taking the job, even after Scaramucci sold his investment firm to take it.

Scaramucci then appealed directly to Trump to find him another position. He had three meetings scheduled with the President, and they were all cancelled. Scaramucci believed that Priebus, who is in charge of Trump’s schedule, worked to keep him away from Trump. Scaramucci “had to go over the top and directly to the President,” a source familiar with the episode said. “The problem is that Trump is in such a bubble now, he doesn’t know what the hell is going on.” Scaramucci was offered the ambassadorship to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, in Europe.

If Priebus thought he had rid the White House of Scaramucci, he was wrong. In recent weeks, Scaramucci was a familiar figure at the Trump Hotel in Washington, meeting with reporters and Trump advisers. Ostensibly, he was there because he was working as an official at the D.C.-based Export-Import Bank. But, clearly, something else was in the works.

For Spicer, Trump’s decision to install Scaramucci above him—the press secretary reports to the communications director—was too much to take. Given the highs and lows of Spicer’s time at the White House, this was an unusual choice of hills to die on. Spicer began his tenure as press secretary with a bizarre rant about how Trump’s Inauguration audience “was the largest audience to ever witness an Inauguration, period.” (It wasn’t.) For someone who was never fully inside the Trump circle of trust, the performance had the ring of an eager gang initiate committing a crime to please the boss. Trump, who regularly watched the briefings, which were broadcast live on cable news, reportedly complained about Spicer’s pale suits and later seemed to become aggravated that Spicer was becoming famous, or at least infamous. Spicer’s temper tantrums, ill-fitting suits, and mispronunciations turned him into a pop-culture sensation .

But it was Spicer’s lies and defense of lies that he will be remembered for. Spicer defended Trump’s lie about how there were three million fraudulent votes in the 2016 election. He spent weeks using shifting stories to defend Trump’s lie about President Barack Obama wiretapping Trump Tower. In trying to explain the urgency of the attack on Syria, Spicer explained , “You had someone as despicable as Hitler, who didn’t even sink to using chemical weapons.”

Last week, he lied about the nature of the meeting at Trump Tower in June, 2016, between senior Trump-campaign officials and several people claiming to have information about Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. “There was nothing, as far as we know, that would lead anyone to believe that there was anything except for discussion about adoption,” Spicer claimed , bizarrely, because Donald Trump, Jr., had already admitted that the meeting was about Russian dirt on Clinton. On March 10th, Spicer came to the lectern wearing an upside-down American flag, which is a signal of dire distress .

Despite the repeated humiliations of standing before reporters and saying things he had to know were untrue, what finally made working at the White House intolerable for Spicer was a minor staffing issue. Scaramucci comes to his new job with a good reputation. He is not a conservative ideologue —he is pro-choice, a moderate on gun control, and anti-death penalty—and he is well-liked by reporters. But working for Trump can have a corrosive effect on good people. Scaramucci’s task is to, without sacrificing his own reputation, communicate on behalf of a President who routinely lies. Scaramucci has his work cut out for him."
486,http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/are-we-nearing-the-endgame-with-isis,newyorker,Are We Nearing the Endgame with ISIS?,[],"The American diplomat Brett McGurk is the central player in the seventy-two-nation coalition fighting the Islamic State, a disparate array of countries twice the size of NATO . He has now worked all of America’s major wars against extremism—in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria—under three very different Presidents: George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and now Donald Trump. McGurk served in Baghdad after the ouster of Saddam Hussein; he used his experience clerking for the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist on the Supreme Court to help draft Iraq’s new constitution. President Bush brought McGurk back to Washington to serve on the National Security Council and help run the campaign against Al Qaeda. President Obama tapped him to work Iraq and Iran at the State Department. McGurk was visiting Kurdistan, in northern Iraq, when ISIS seized nearby Mosul. In 2015, he became Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS . President Trump kept him on.

In a sign of how fast the Islamic State is shrinking, McGurk last month visited northern Syria. I called on him Wednesday, at his small whitewashed office on the ground floor of the State Department, to assess the future of ISIS and the world’s most unconventional nation. McGurk is an optimist, long-term, despite the chorus of skeptics in Washington about extremism, Iraq and Syria, and U.S. foreign policy in the volatile Middle East. The interview has been edited and condensed. McGurk’s most chilling answer was when he talked about how many ISIS fighters are still alive.

Where is ISIS ? The leaders? The fighters? Intelligence assessments claim that at least twenty per cent of the fighters have returned to their countries of origin, with some exceptions like Britain, where it may be as high as fifty per cent. Where are they going as they face defeat?

We had forty thousand foreign fighters come into Syria from over a hundred and ten countries, as far away as China. The reason Mosul was so difficult in the final three weeks of battle was because we had hundreds of foreign fighters in the Old City barricaded in civilian structures. Our guys could hear them on the radio speaking Chinese, Russian, Dutch, French.

Did some foreign fighters get out before we had the borders sealed? Yes. Now it is extremely difficult. Foreign fighters who are in Iraq and Syria are going to die in Iraq and Syria. Mosul is now finished. Raqqa is surrounded.

[The American-backed] Syrian Democratic Forces have cleared about forty per cent of the city. [ ISIS fighters] are concentrating now in small towns along a little span of the Euphrates River that crisscrosses the Iraq and Syria border in the middle of nowhere. These guys used to plan major attacks in Raqqa, with the infrastructure of a city, and then send teams to conduct attacks in Paris and Brussels. They can’t do that anymore.

How many ISIS fighters are still active? And where?

Our experts think the active cadre of ISIS fighters is down to twelve thousand total fighters, local and foreign. The Syrian Democratic Forces, the force we are working with, is incredibly brave. They are going into these high-rise buildings, room by room, floor by floor, to root these guys out.

Is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the ISIS caliph, alive? And what is he doing?

This is someone who cannot show his face. He communicates by audiotapes, like we are back in the nineteen-nineties. He has dramatically tainted his claim to any legitimacy. Whether or not he is alive, we do not know. But his command and control over this organization is severed.

What is the U.S. military role after the caliphate collapses?

Our coalition has trained a hundred thousand members of the Iraqi security force that had collapsed in 2014. They have now fought some of the most difficult battles since the Second World War. We are in discussions with the Iraqi government about a future role for the coalition training and advising. In Syria, we have also pioneered this model of working by, with, and through local forces. It’s local Syrians retaking their areas. Our footprint is small, it’s light, but it is effective. We will want to be able to keep the pressure so that ISIS can’t regenerate.

So air strikes will continue?

If we see an ISIS leader or something, we will retain the right. In this campaign, coalition-enabled operations have cleared out a total of sixty thousand square kilometres [roughly twenty-three thousand square miles]. We liberated almost five million people. ISIS has not retaken a single square kilometre. This is not the day when you go clear, but can’t hold, and the enemy comes back. The model that we are using appears to be sustainable.

So, is ISIS going to come back? They’ll always be around as small terrorist cells. We want to make sure the Iraqis are able to handle that. But in terms of ISIS being able to regenerate as a force that can take and seize territory as it could in 2014, I just don’t think they’ll ever retain that capability.

Fourteen years after the U.S. intervention, in 2003, Iraq still does not have a political deal to share power among sectarian and ethnic factions. How does Iraq solve an issue as important to the future of the country as the military campaign?

I resist the notion that because there wasn’t some political deal in Baghdad, the Sunnis decided to put their lot with ISIS . That is simplistic. ISIS came into Sunni areas and anyone who didn’t agree with their twisted vision was murdered. Sunnis were the largest victims of ISIS .

The government of Iraq has a policy of decentralization, empowering people at the local level to restore life to their communities. Iraq will have an election, probably in May of next year. The divisions in Iraqi society now are not so much Sunni-Shia. There are big divisions among the different Shia groups and inter-Sunni. Frankly, some Sunni tribes sided with ISIS in 2014. In these communities, there isn’t a get-out-of-jail-free card.

There have been a lot of revenge killings.

Probably not as many as had been predicted, but yes. It’s impossible to have a totally clean aftermath.

Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said that the Popular Mobilization Forces, predominantly Shiite militias, weren’t allowed in Mosul, but I saw their pickup trucks—with big flags waving sayings from the Quran—all over town. How much of a concern is the unleashing of the P.M.F., now and down the road?

The P.M.F. arose from a fatwa issued by Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani in the worst days of 2014, when it looked like Baghdad could fall. He issued a fatwa for able-bodied males to help save the country. About eighty per cent have proved to be quite disciplined; they operate under control of the state. About twenty per cent of them are not. That includes some Shia militia groups. It also includes some Sunni groups that have discipline problems. Given the terrain that Iraq had to cover during the Mosul campaign, there was some necessity for the Popular Mobilization Forces. This is an issue that the Iraqi government has to get its arms around.

Since 2003, Iran has played an increasing role in Iraq. How do you assess their intentions down the road and their power compared to the U.S.?

Iran likes to be flattered with the view that everything that happens in Iraq and Syria happens because Iran is pulling the strings. That’s just not true. Do they have enormous influence? Yes. Just look at a map and you can understand why. But the differences, even within the Shia community in Iraq and the Shia community in Iran, are profound. The vision of [Iraq’s] Grand Ayatollah Sistani —of quietism and a civil state, meaning not a state governed by clerics—is totally different from the vision of [Iran’s] Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. The Iranians tried to do a number of things in Iraq that simply have not worked, because the Iraqis rejected it. Their influence is not dominant. I never discount the ability of the Iraqis to chart their own course.

Al Qaeda has consolidated its hold over Idlib, the last Syrian province beyond the regime’s control. How worried are you about Al Qaeda’s rise in the jihadi world as ISIS is collapsing?

I’m very concerned about Idlib. Trends apparent for some time culminated over the last couple of weeks, with the dominant Al Qaeda movement taking the main border crossings and populated areas. We have to make sure Al Qaeda-linked fighters cannot get in and out. We are going to have to work with the Turks and others to degrade this presence. This is not something that’s spreading. But, within Idlib, Al Qaeda is working hard to take the reins of power.

Raqqa is the caliphate’s capital. Who rules it after the defeat of ISIS ? Is it like Mosul, returning to government control—President Bashar al-Assad—or is it like Berlin, where different forces vie for control of its future and territory?

As complex as Mosul is, Raqqa is more complex. There’s a Raqqa Civilian Council that we’re working with in Ayn Issa, about forty kilometres or so north. The council is a group of Syrians from the area. They’ve already committed to an election in Raqqa no later than next May. The process is well laid out. There are fifty thousand civilians in Raqqa right now, plus about two hundred and fifty thousand displaced people, so the scale is nowhere near Mosul. The long-term settlement of the Syrian civil war is a more distant issue.

Technically, the Assad government can reclaim control of Raqqa?

Connections between Damascus and opposition areas—in terms of paying teachers’ salaries, paying doctors—never completely went away, even in hard-core opposition areas. But people there are going to have some say, and the Syrians I have met in that area do not want the regime to come back before you have a settlement to the over-all civil war. That would breed quite a bit of resistance.

The phase we’re in right now: defeat ISIS ; eliminate the caliphate; and, in parallel, work to de-escalate the over-all civil war through de-escalation areas—the agreement just worked out with Russia in the south, which President Putin and President Trump finalized, it is holding. Two and a half weeks into that ceasefire, fighting has really stopped. So defeat ISIS , de-escalate the over-all civil war, then set the conditions for a realistic discussion of a political settlement.

What about jihadism down the road?

This is not a battle led by the United States. ISIS is a threat to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the U.A.E., to all of our Muslim partners. We have found over the last year a real seriousness to take on this ideological battle.

But by autocratic governments and the countries that gave us the ideology in the first place.

When we started, in 2014, ISIS propaganda outnumbered anti- ISIS propaganda six to one [online]. That ratio’s now reversed. Twitter’s taken off hundreds of thousands of pro- ISIS handles. This is a multifaceted effort not just with governments. It is private sector, it is religious, it is civil society. What law-enforcement people need is information. If we get a phone off the battlefield, or a notebook, or an address book, we are able to vet and verify names, and we have now built a database of nineteen thousand names of known foreign fighters who have tried to join or are affiliated with ISIS [or its sympathizers]. We share that with host nations, and they share it with Interpol.

The nineteen thousand fighters, affiliates, and sympathizers—do we believe they are still alive, or are many of them dead?

Most of them are alive."

But his crackdown has torn some families apart. Illustration by Rachel Levit

On June 28th, President Trump convened a roundtable at the White House that included victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. The event was part of the Administration’s push to pass several new immigration bills designed to, in Trump’s words, “close the dangerous loopholes exploited by criminals, gang members, drug dealers, killers, terrorists.” A regular theme of the Trump Administration’s messaging on immigration has been to present undocumented “bad hombres” as an immediate threat to the safety and cohesion of the American family unit. But some of Trump’s immigration policies, in themselves, have endangered families across America. The stories below, of four mothers who have been targeted for deportation since January, show how. As the director of the Global Migration Project, at Columbia Journalism School, I spent the spring supervising a team of twelve journalists who sought to understand the evolution of Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) under President Trump. We began by assembling a database of enforcement activity: pulling in information from all fifty states on local raids, family separations, immigration-detention trends, and more. For three months, we scoured law-enforcement blotters, public ICE memos, local news sources, and social-media forums. We then spoke with individuals facing removal proceedings around the country, as well as their attorneys, employers, colleagues, spouses, and children. We’ll be rolling out the results of related investigations in the coming months. But here, we’re sharing one trend that conflicts with Trump’s rhetorical focus on immigrants who “are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers.” In fact, his Administration’s agents are targeting, in large numbers, individuals for whom public-safety justifications for removal don’t apply. This includes a considerable number of women who have no criminal records and who are either the primary caretakers of young children, or the primary family breadwinners, or both. Four such cases are presented here. While Barack Obama’s Administration deported more than three million people, with plenty of non-felons among them, the cases documented here reflect changes from the previous Administration’s enforcement priorities—mothers, for instance, who’d been picked up under Obama and qualified for temporary legal relief, only to face swift removal, or its threat, under the new Administration. These stories offer closeups of Trump-era immigration enforcement—including the words and images of families at their center. This project was produced in collaboration with Adriana Loureiro Fernández, Micah Hauser, Shana Daloria, and Nicole Einbinder. The Candy-Factory Worker

On April 5th, two days after Maribel Trujillo Diaz had visited her local ICE office in Fairfield, Ohio, for a routine appointment, she left her home to see a relative. As she walked, she was followed by ICE agents in a truck. They soon got out and arrested her. Her son, Oswaldo, got a call from someone who’d witnessed the scene, telling him to come quickly. He jumped on his bike, but when he arrived, ICE had already driven off with his mother. Trujillo grew up in Hidalgo, Mexico, in the state of Michoacán, a region now beset by drug cartels. In 2002, when she crossed the border, she was pregnant with Oswaldo. She and her husband, Gustavo, settled in Fairfield—a small city half an hour from Cincinnati—where some family members already lived. Trujillo found work in a poultry plant, and it was there, during a 2007 raid, that she had her first encounter with ICE . According to her attorney, Kathleen Kersh, of the Ohio-based Advocates for Basic Legal Equality, ICE arrested a hundred and sixty individuals after that raid, but Trujillo avoided deportation. In 2012, Trujillo filed for asylum. Life had become dangerous for her relatives back in Mexico; she told a court about how her brother had been kidnapped by members of a cartel called La Familia Michoacana. Other relatives, she said, were also being threatened. In 2014, after two years of hearings, her claim was denied. Trujillo’s four children—fourteen-year-old Oswaldo, twelve-year-old Alexa, ten-year-old Gustavo, Jr., and three-year-old Daniela—were all U.S. citizens, and Trujillo was terrified of being separated from them. Her job at a candy factory provided the family with much of its income. Gustavo has medical conditions that make it difficult for him to work; Daniela, their youngest, experiences seizures. In 2015, Trujillo’s daughter Alexa wrote a letter to Senator Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, begging him to help her mother. “It is not fair what you are doing to my mom. Why does she have to go to mexico she is not a criminal or a bad person,” Alexa wrote. “I’m real going to miss her more cause she is realy far away from me and my family. In the morning when I wake up I’m not goin to see her in bed.” The family was granted a reprieve: ICE chose not to deport Trujillo. As long as she reported for routine check-ins with ICE , she was likely to avoid deportation. Last year, under the Obama Administration, she was granted a one-year work permit that would have expired this July. But within three months of Trump taking office agents picked her up. In the days following Trujillo’s arrest, her case drew widespread attention. Rallies and protests were held in her name, led by friends and family, as well as religious leaders from across Ohio. The state’s most prominent politicians—not just Brown, a progressive Democrat, but also Senator Rob Portman, a Republican—sent personal requests to ICE asking for leniency for Trujillo. Ohio’s Republican Governor, John Kasich, told the press he did not want to see her deported. Father Michael Pucke, Trujillo’s parish priest at St. Julie Billiart Catholic Church, in Hamilton, Ohio, visited Trujillo at the Butler County jail, where he prayed and read scripture with her. Pucke has known Trujillo for more than ten years. “She’s quiet, not someone who would stand out in a crowd, but was thoughtful and had deep faith,” he said. In the jail, he recalled, she was tired, frightened, and cold. “It’s in God’s hands,” she told him. Trujillo asked Pucke to make sure her children did their homework. “That says something to me not only about a mother’s love but how important it was that her children take advantage of what they have in this country,” Pucke said. A few days after her arrest, Trujillo was transferred to La Salle, a detention center in Jena, Louisiana. On April 19th, she was deported to Mexico. Her daughter Alexa had sketched the scene two years earlier, at the end of her letter to Senator Brown; the picture featured Alexa and her siblings watching their mother fly off in a plane, a deportee. The Caretaker

Oregon has been home for as long as Alejandra Ruiz can remember. She wasn’t yet two years old in 1988, when her mother brought her and her older sister to the U.S. from Guatemala, fleeing that country’s civil war. The family lived in California for a short time, then settled in Portland, where her mother found work as a housekeeper. Her mother applied for asylum upon arrival in the U.S., but her case was denied. The government issued a deportation order for Ruiz when she was still a toddler. Her mother never told her about the order—in fact, she did not find out she was undocumented until she was twenty-four-years old. Ruiz grew up thinking she was a U.S. citizen. Three years ago, Ruiz moved with her four kids to Beaverton, a suburb west of Portland. The streets were quiet and the children’s schools were nearby. Ruiz had a job at a senior-care facility, working twelve-hour overnight shifts. Early on the morning of March 26th, ICE agents arrived at Ruiz’s house. She was still at work, but a neighbor called to tell her that law enforcement was knocking at her door; worried, she then called the local non-emergency number, to find out what was wrong. A little while later, an ICE agent called her back. He explained that she was the subject of a decades-old deportation order, Ruiz recalls. If she didn’t come to the local ICE office immediately, agents would return to arrest her. Ruiz arranged for relatives to watch her kids and went to the office. Stephen Robbins, Ruiz’s lawyer, said that her case was the first time he noticed a shift in immigration policies under the Trump Administration. “A lot of the stories we were seeing on the news were people who might have had problems under Obama, too—Alejandra’s case was the first one where it was like, No, this is different,” he said. “During the Obama years, they might have gone to her house and said, ‘Hey, we need you to come in and do a check-in,’ but what would have happened almost certainly is they would have let her go.” At the ICE office, as the hours passed, Ruiz kept thinking they’d soon release her. Instead, shackles were placed around her ankles, wrists, and waist, and she was taken to the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, Washington, a for-profit immigrant-detention facility operated by the GEO Group, a large private-prison firm. In detention, Ruiz barely ate—the food, mainly bread and beans, looked bad and smelled worse. Officers gave her fibre packets and pills, but she refused to take them. She spent time in the center's law library, researching her rights. Talking to her kids on the phone was excruciating. When they spoke at all, it was mostly sobs. Her twelve-year-old daughter was especially distraught. Ruiz didn’t want her kids to know how much she feared being deported to Guatemala—a country where she knew no one. “I haven’t done anything but work here and try to live a normal life with my kids,” she said. Guatemala was a world away. “You hear the stories,” she said—fellow-detainees had told her about the rise of gang violence and lawlessness in the country. “I don’t want to go to there, I don’t want to take my kids there.” Robbins filed a motion to reopen her childhood asylum case, and on March 30th—less than a week after her arrest—Ruiz was released from detention to wait for a deportation hearing. That weekend, she turned thirty-one. She didn’t feel like celebrating. Her kids were elated but terrified, too. Her oldest daughter, Ashley, begged to stay home from school, fearing Ruiz would be gone when she came back at the end of the day. “I feel like everything I’ve worked so hard for was taken from me,” Ruiz said. As she awaits a decision on her case, she has another pressing concern: she lost her job at the senior-care facility during her time in detention. “I started off in a one-bedroom with my kids and worked my butt off to be where I’m at for them,” she said. Now she worries they may soon face eviction and homelessness. “I don’t have a mansion, but I have something for my kids to call their own.” The Apple Picker

Dolores Bustamante Romero was born in a small rural town near Mexico City. She was the second of four children; her mother, who was on her own, struggled to provide for them. At sixteen, Bustamante moved in with a man in his early twenties. “He was nice, at the beginning,” she said. The couple had four kids together, but their relationship soured. “A normal day would be, ‘You’re good for nothing. Who do you think would want you like that?’ ” Dolores said. “That was a normal day.” In 2003, when Bustamante was in her early thirties, a man at work told her that he was going to the U.S.—to New Jersey. “I can help you,” he said. “You don’t have to stay here.” She took up his offer. “It was heartbreaking, because I couldn’t bring all of my children,” she recalled. Bustamante left her three older kids with her mother—she’d send back money to support them—and set out with her youngest daughter, who was then three. After stints cleaning offices and working in factories, Bustamante took up low-wage farm jobs: picking pumpkins, cutting watermelon. An apple-picking gig in upstate New York changed her life. A fellow-farmworker introduced Bustamante to Mujeres Divinas, an organization that helps women working in agricultural jobs. “I found out that not having documents doesn’t mean that we can’t do something,” she said. She also became an active member of her local church, and got involved with the Worker Justice Center of New York, an organization that advocates on behalf of agricultural workers. Bustamante was finally feeling settled. She was supporting her kids back in Mexico and her daughter in New York, and she was proud of that. Then, one morning in October, 2014, she was pulled over while driving to church with her daughter, and arrested by Border Patrol. The Worker Justice Center intervened on her behalf, and Bustamante was released from detention on an order of supervision. For the next few years, her case wound its way through the immigration courts. She paid steep fees to an attorney, who never pressed to have her case administratively closed, which, during the Obama Administration, was a common way for undocumented parents who’d committed no significant crimes to resolve their cases. In February, a new attorney named Jose Perez agreed to take her case pro bono—but by then, he said, the legal landscape had shifted. On March 15th, Dolores stood in a courtroom in Batavia, New York, facing the prospect of imminent deportation. “It felt like a death sentence,” she said, about the prospect of returning to Mexico. “They wanted to kick her out that day,” Perez recalls, of the government’s position in March. But at the hearing, Perez convinced the judge to grant an extension, and in May, he told the court that Bustamante planned to apply for asylum. “I believe she could be in danger if sent back,” he said. Later this month, they’ll return to court, to help determine Bustamante’s fate. “In the previous Administration, we would’ve already closed this case—that is not the situation with the new Administration,” Perez said. “I closed two hundred cases last year, because we had the chance to negotiate with the prosecution based on the deportation priorities,” he said. “I requested to close this case almost as soon as I got it, but the prosecution told me that there was no chance of that happening as things are laid out now.” The Hotel Worker"

490,http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1960/12/17/childrens-friend,newyorker,The World of Dr. Seuss,[],"The face of Theodor Seuss Geisel—an arresting one, with soft eyes and a long, beaky nose—is not nearly as familiar as that of Santa Claus, yet its owner is an equally formidable contender for the adulation of many children. Santa Claus brings them presents. Geisel makes them laugh, and, what is more, he’s real. Since 1936, under the alias of Dr. Seuss, Geisel, a plain and gentle man who is now fifty-six, has written and illustrated nineteen humorous books for children, all but three in galloping verse. Being shy, tense, and serious-minded, he tries to avoid the popping eyes and clutching hands of his disciples, but on the rare occasions when he is harried into making a personal appearance at an autographing bee, he attracts crowds that would cause a Western television hero to sway in the saddle with envy. There have been many attempts, some of them jocular, to define the age groups for which the Dr. Seuss books have the greatest appeal. Random House, which has published practically all of Geisel’s books, conservatively catalogues his works in the five-to-nine-year-old bracket. A Bowling Green, Kentucky, reviewer, however, once estimated the age of the audience for “How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” a Geisel variation on the theme of Scrooge, to range from two to ninety-two; a Houston, Texas, critic put it at three to ninety-three. And in Junior Reviewers, a seven-year-old junior reviewer wrote of “Scrambled Eggs Super!,” a Geisel variation on the theme of scrambled eggs, “All ages would like it from 6 to 44—that’s how old my mother is.” There has been a great deal thought, said, and written about the quality of contemporary children’s books, much of it in high-flown psychological and sociological jargon. Geisel’s own approach to the topic is down-to-earth. “If a book pleases me, it has a chance of pleasing children,” he says. Many of the elders whom he also pleases are faithful to him because they feel that they can read, and reread, and re-reread a Dr. Seuss book to a child without imperilling their own mental balance or—by skipping paragraphs or whole pages—impairing their integrity. This is not to say that Geisel has no detractors. There are those who think his pictures and words are plain silly—a few of the leaders of this faction would just as soon seek to divert their children with the exterior of a cereal box—but most guardians of the young mind, it would appear, are willing to go along with the Bulletin of the Parents League of New York, which has enthusiastically endorsed Geisel’s books. The League classifies them as “read-alouds.” He himself fancies the description “logical insanity.” The reading aloud of logical insanity, appropriately illustrated by its creator, has always been fun, but between Edward Lear’s day and Dr. Seuss’s the pickings, few people would deny, have been slim. Geisel and his wife, who under her maiden name of Helen Palmer is herself the author of several successful but more or less conventional children’s books—to name a few, “Tommy’s Wonderful Rides,” “Johnny’s Machines,” “Bobby and His Airplane,” and “Donald Duck Sees South America”—are childless. Some of their friends consider it a shame that a man who is so beloved by so many children has none of his own. Geisel does not agree. “You have ’em, I’ll amuse ’em,” he has said on more than one occasion, and he has also said, “You can’t write books for children if too many of them are looking over your shoulder.” With no children at all looking over his shoulder, Geisel painstakingly turns out books that, in the opinion of Rudolf Flesch, the “Why Johnny Can’t Read” man, will be read a hundred years hence, when, also in Flesch’s opinion, Hemingway, Faulkner, Marquand, and other current favorites may be gathering dust. Flesch rates Geisel “a genius pure and simple.” Bennett Cerf, the president of Random House, has stated that Geisel is the only genius on his list, though Cerf would probably not have put it so baldly had Faulkner, whom he also publishes, been in his office at the time. For the last few years, Geisel has been the best-selling author on the Random House list, and possibly on any list anywhere. Once or twice a year, the Times puts out a Sunday children’s-book supplement and includes a roster of best-sellers; in last month’s ratings three of the top four sellers were by Dr. Seuss. When Nevil Shute died, last January, his obituary in the Times proclaimed him the best-selling novelist of his day, adding that his yearly royalties amounted to a hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars. Geisel’s book royalties came to nearly two hundred thousand dollars in 1959. To date, nearly three million copies of Dr. Seuss’s books have been sold, and Random House now orders a first printing of a hundred thousand copies of any book that he writes. Even this figure proved inadequate for “Happy Birthday to You!,” which was issued in October, 1959; within a few weeks, stocks of the book were exhausted, and fifty thousand additional copies were run off. Geisel is staggered and a bit frightened by his opulence, for he has never learned to come to grips with money. Not quite trusting money, he hardly ever carries any, and he frequently grabs for restaurant checks only to discover that he can’t pay them. He gave up trying to cope with checkbooks some thirty years ago, and turned them over to his wife. “I wish people would stop talking to me about money,” he says. “All I want to do is to write books, and everybody’s forever nagging at me to keep them.” Geisel’s tastes are simple. “Ted has no extravagances,” his wife says. “I can’t think of anything he likes except cigarettes and rocks.” His cigarette outlay runs comparatively high. A chain smoker, he now and then breaks off for a while and sucks on an unlighted corncob pipe filled with radish seeds. Whenever a compulsion to smoke sweeps over him—which is every few minutes—he waters his seeds with an eyedropper. Once a crop of radish greens has sprouted from his pipe bowl—which he says takes about three days in a hospitable environment—he goes back to cigarettes. Rocks are his outdoor hobby. At his home, astride a hilltop in La Jolla, California, he is an earnest rock gardener, and Publishers’ Weekly is apt to be crowded off his parlor table by some lithic journal like Guide for Beginning Fossil Hunters . One of his most treasured possessions is a heavy stone slab with a dinosaur’s footprint in it, reputed to be something over a hundred and fifty million years old. Geisel himself is reputed to be something of a prankster, and, to his indignation, quite a few of his acquaintances refuse to believe that his hoary fossil is not homemade. La Jolla is an upper-bracket community, and the relative austerity of the Geisels’ way of life confounds their neighbors. Geisel and his wife have only one car, only one maid—part-time, at that—and only one swimming pool. After thirty-three years of married life, they are an uncommonly devoted couple, and they see no reason to have a second car, since they are rarely apart. Mrs. Geisel stopped writing books of her own fifteen years ago, so she could concentrate on helping her husband with his. This she does in part by keeping a vigilant critical eye on his output, in part by giving him the reassurance and praise for which he, like many another writer, has an insatiable need, and in part by shielding him from distractions. Along with his finances, she handles his correspondence. Geisel’s—or, rather, Dr. Seuss’s—mail is imposing. At the end of 1957, Random House announced that in the previous twelve months he had received nine thousand two hundred and sixty-seven pounds of it. No up-to-date statistics have been released, but whatever the avoirdupois of Geisel’s current mail, it amounts to thousands of letters a week. Geisel’s policy is to have his wife answer letters from teachers, librarians, sick or crippled children, and entire school classes. (Mrs. Geisel signs some of the replies “Mrs. Dr. Seuss.”) The rest of his fan mail hardly ever gets to La Jolla. It is mercifully intercepted and screened by Random House, which sends the bulk of his correspondents a printed form letter that he has written and illustrated. The form letter in use until just recently explained that Dr. Seuss’s mail service was unreliable, because he lived on a steep and inaccessible precipice and because his correspondence had to travel by Budget, an ungainly Seuss beast, driven by Nudget, a Seuss Budget-driver. Most children were satisfied with this reply, but now and then a persistent correspondent would grumble. “Did you get a letter from a girl named Olive or a boy named Bud?” an Oregon schoolchild wrote Dr. Seuss a year or so ago. “They are both in my classroom. Did you get their letter? I don’t think you did the way your roads are but they will write to you again and then are you going to write to them again about the Budget and the Nudget? I want a letter from you again but not about the Budget and Nudget again.” Geisel sought to curtail laments of this sort by fashioning a new illustrated form letter, which thanks the correspondent on behalf of Dr. Seuss himself and a friend—the Three-Muffed Apfel Moose.

It is only within the last couple of years that Geisel’s fan mail and sales figures have soared into the literary stratosphere. As recently as 1954, he asked his agent, Phyllis Jackson, of the Music Corporation of America, whether she thought he could count on five thousand dollars annually from book royalties in the foreseeable future. She said he could, and now he knows he can. Not only does he write a new book or two every year but the sales of each book on his back list grow larger every year. All his old books are current best-sellers. An early one, “The King’s Stilts,” which was published in 1939, sold 4,648 copies the first year. By 1941, its annual sales were down to 394. In 1958, the last year for which figures are obtainable, they were up to 11,037. “The King’s Stilts” has been a more sluggish mover than any other Dr. Seuss book; its cumulative sales have climbed nearly to the 75,000 mark. Another early Dr. Seuss, “Horton Hatches the Egg,” which has had total sales of more than 200,000 and is still briskly hatching profits, sold 5,801 copies in 1940, the year it came out. It, too, fell off—to 1,645 the following year. In 1958, it sold 27,463 copies. What appears to have given all the Dr. Seuss books their recent boost was the publication, in 1957, of “The Cat in the Hat,” which seems likely to achieve a total sale of a million copies by the end of this year. Since the book is priced at a dollar ninety-five, this would bring its retail gross to nearly two million dollars—equivalent to the gross on six million copies of a thirty-five-cent paperback. Only two works of fiction, “God’s Little Acre” and “Peyton Place,” have sold as well as that in paperback form. And “The Cat in the Hat” is aseptic. “The Cat in the Hat” evolved from a 1954 article in Life by John Hersey, who complained of the sorry state of children’s primers and suggested that someone like Dr. Seuss ought to give the kids a break by providing them with sprightlier fare. Among those who urged Geisel to accept this challenge was William Spaulding, then the textbook editor and now the president of Houghton Miffiin. Having long felt that the “See the red ball? The ball is red” school of literature left a good deal to be desired, Geisel did not need much prodding. He was somewhat taken aback to learn that a primer was supposed to have a severely limited vocabulary—a particularly inhibiting restriction for a writer whose métier is verse—but after a long struggle he came up with a book that had a plot, had humor, rhymed, and did it all on a vocabulary of only two hundred-odd words. Houghton Mifflin issued “The Cat in the Hat” as a textbook, and Random House as a trade book. Hersey called it a “gift to the art of reading” and a “harum-scarum masterpiece.” Curiously, the Random House edition, sold through bookstores, has far outdistanced the Houghton Mifflin one, sold through school channels; the explanation may be that some old-line educators have tended to be suspicious of a primer produced by a man who signs himself “Dr.” but has never written a doctoral dissertation, and that others have felt the teaching process is a solemn business, not to be interrupted by avoidable laughter. Geisel, being fond of both cats and children, was glad that he had been able to use the one species to edify the other. In real life he sometimes finds the relationship between animals and human beings cruelly bewildering—not long ago he rescued a mouse that was floundering in his pool, only to see it scamper straight into a mousetrap he had set in his garage—but in his books he manages to reconcile his innate kindheartedness with some of the nasty practices implicit in the survival of the fittest. When a situation in “McElligot’s Pool,” for instance, seemed to call for a picture of a worm on a hook, Geisel made it graphically clear that his worm was not skewered on his barb but instead had curled itself up there cozily. At the moment, the Geisels, who once kept twenty-five or thirty cats, have only one pet—an aging, wheezy Irish setter. Their home, though, is filled with Dr. Seuss animals—painted, carved into chair backs and chests of drawers, or sculptured by him out of any old objects that have come to hand, like shaving brushes—as well as with store-bought toy animals collected by his wife. As a wedding-anniversary present one year, she gave her husband a delicate life-size model of a cockroach. Geisel was touched, but professionally he shuns any animal that looks normal. The animals that Geisel confects are anatomically absurd, as flexible and floppy-looking as rag dolls—or, indeed, as many children wish real pets were. “My animals look the way they do because I’ve never learned to draw,” he explains. He does, in fact, draw very much like an untutored child; first he makes an outline of the creature he has in mind, and then he fills in the enclosed area with solid colors. In 1954, he appeared on a children’s television program called “Excursion,” in the course of which he attempted to demonstrate how different the same animal could look to different artists by having six young abstract painters render their impressions of a horse. Geisel did not enter this sweepstakes himself, but he commented sympathetically on the utterly dissimilar, and universally unnaturalistic, results. In private, Geisel is less indulgent toward much contemporary art. To spoof a friend who had pretensions as a collector, he once told him at length about a nonexistent abstract painter called Escorobus. “I have some of his finest works at home,” Geisel said, “and he’s given me permission to act as his agent in selling them.” Then he went home and dashed off a wallful of Escorobuses. The friend came around to see them, and was reaching for his checkbook when Geisel owned up to the hoax. “That experience made me suspect that a lot of modern art is malarkey,” Geisel says. “If I can do it myself, it can’t be any good.”

Geisel’s father, Theodore Robert Geisel, is superintendent of the Springfield, Massachusetts, public-park system, and since his dominion includes a zoo, it is sometimes thought that his son’s predilection for animals—one of Dr. Seuss’s best-sellers is “If I Ran the Zoo”—is traceable back to boyhood. But the elder Geisel—a vigorous, ramrod-straight, silver-haired man of eighty-three—did not start running his zoo until his son had grown up; before that, he ran a Springfield brewery that his father had founded. (The brewery’s original name was Kuhlmbach & Geisel, which in Springfield taverns was traditionally amended to “Come back and guzzle.”) The younger Theodor was born on March 2, 1904. His forebears on both sides were German—his mother, Henrietta Seuss, who died in 1928, was the daughter of a Springfield baker—and he was raised in a Turnverein and Schützverein atmosphere. His father was an international rifle champion, and his mother was a crack shot, too; he is not. During the First World War, the Geisels, although they were by then pretty well Americanized and vociferously loyal, felt uneasy. Germans, brewers, marksmen—who wouldn’t? Geisel attributes much of his present diffidence to an incident that took place when the Springfield Boy Scouts, himself among them, were competitively peddling thrift stamps and Liberty Bonds. His grandfather Geisel was so doggedly openhanded a customer that young Ted compiled the second-best sales record in town. The day came when the leading salesboys were to be awarded medals, and Theodore Roosevelt arrived in Springfield to do the honors. “We all put on our Scout uniforms and marched to City Hall,” Geisel recalls, “and after Roosevelt had given a fiery speech, we lined up onstage to be decorated. But somebody had made a mistake, and there were ten boys and only nine medals. I happened to be tenth in line. When I stepped forward, with my whole family sitting proudly in the audience, all ready to applaud, Roosevelt had nothing to pin on me. He just stood there, nonplussed. Then a Scoutmaster ran up and said there had been a misunderstanding, and shoved me off the stage. I’ve had a dread of platform appearances ever since. After finishing public high school in Springfield, Geisel entered Dartmouth with the class of 1925, which the present vice-president of the college has hailed—in no small measure because Dr. Seuss belongs to it—as Dartmouth’s greatest class ever. (Some members of the class of ’26 insist that they have a matching claim to fame, because their ranks include the composer of “Rudolph, the Red-nosed Reindeer.”) Geisel became editor of the college humor magazine, the Jack-o-Lantern , to which he contributed reams of cartoons, many of them involving bizarre animals. It was standard undergraduate fare; one cartoon, captioned “Financial Note: Goat Milk Is Higher Than Ever,” showed a female mountain goat with her forefeet and her hind feet on two uneven peaks, which raised her udder above her head. Geisel’s editorship of the magazine gave him the status of a big man on campus, and he has been a big man there ever since. He has even judged a beauty-queen contest at the Dartmouth Winter Carnival. Whenever the Geisels come East nowadays, they try to fit in a visit to Dartmouth. The college library has a complete set of Dr. Seuss’s works, and now and then, in an avuncular mood, it puts them on display. In the archives of the library are manuscripts by Sinclair Lewis, Booth Tarkington, and Robert Frost, and also the manuscript of Dr. Seuss’s “The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins.” In 1955, Dartmouth legitimized Dr. Seuss’s title by making Geisel an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters. His citation, composed by the president of the college, Dr. John S. Dickey, read, in part, “You singlehandedly have stood as St. George between a generation of exhausted parents and the demon dragon of unexhausted children on a rainy day.” Dartmouth’s affection for Geisel ’25 has been handsomely reciprocated by his for his alma mater. When he was asked to contribute to a building-fund drive a few years ago, he replied offhandedly that he was leaving Dartmouth a little something in his will. The little something proved to be the copyrights on most of his books. The income from a couple of others is earmarked, through a foundation the Geisels have established, for the San Diego Fine Arts Gallery, of which he is a trustee. But Dartmouth will inherit a large portion of his royalties, and its share of them, twenty or thirty years hence, may very well amount to a quarter of a million dollars a year—the equivalent in income of a six-million-dollar endowment. Dartmouth’s promised legacy was endangered in the summer of 1958, when the Geisels paid an off-season visit to Hanover. Some faculty members who were there cooked up a surprise for Geisel. They had eighty children dress up as characters from his books and serenade him one morning, following which he was dragged onto the folded-down top of an ancient Packard phaeton and driven four times around the campus, while sticky- fingered urchins swarmed lovingly all over him. Geisel, though aware that this accolade had sprung from the best of intentions, was so shaken by it that he was tempted to call his lawyer and have his will redrawn. But he soon calmed down, and now he is as true-blue, or true-green, as ever. “Dartmouth will always be Number One for me,” he has since said. On receiving his bachelor’s degree, Geisel thought he might like to go into teaching. He had somehow given his father the impression that he was in line for a fellowship in English literature at Oxford, and Geisel père had elatedly spread word of this around Springfield. Nothing of the sort came to pass, so Mr. Geisel offered to stake his son to a graduate course at Oxford anyway. Arriving at Lincoln College, young Geisel was miserable. The weather was dank, and, what was worse, he quickly decided that by comparison with his fellow-matriculants he was appallingly ignorant. Helen Palmer, a Wellesley graduate, had entered Oxford a year before him, and she, too, was in the dumps. An American Rhodes Scholar there, Joseph Sagmaster, who knew and pitied both of them, thought that misery deserved company, and introduced them in his rooms one afternoon over anchovy toast. Students at Oxford weren’t allowed motorcycles, but Geisel acquired one anyway. In the hope of avoiding detection, he passed himself off as a poultrymonger, a disguise he effected by always carrying two plucked ducks in a basket wired to his vehicle. Geisel proposed to Miss Palmer while they were both aboard this sputtering prop, and at the instant of her consent the machine went out of control and hurled them into a ditch. They were superficially bruised, but they were engaged. In the judgment of Sagmaster, who became an editorial writer in Cincinnati, and to whose family Dr. Seuss’s “Yertle the Turtle” has been appreciatively dedicated, bringing the Geisels together was “the happiest inspiration I’ve ever had.” The Geisels, who do a lot of travelling, still nostalgically go back to Oxford every so often. When Mrs. Geisel was a student there, she lived in a boarding house and bathed in a tub under a window that she could not, and her landlady would not, close. Thirty years later, the Geisels were in London, and he suggested impulsively one morning, “Let’s go up to Oxford and see if that window is still open.” They took the next train, found that it was, and took the next train back. Geisel’s friends at Oxford were aware that he much preferred drawing pictures to mastering the prescribed curriculum. Miss Palmer kept urging him to give up the academic life for the artistic, but he hesitated. He had already had one galling rebuff. The Oxford University Press had responded with dismaying chilliness to his proposal that he illustrate, and it publish, a new edition of “Paradise Lost.” (It was his plan—and this alone may well have prompted the rejection—to show the Archangel Uriel sliding down a sunbeam with a long-necked oilcan in his hand, to slick his passage.) Geisel got even by leaving Oxford after one year and going to the University of Vienna, where he thought he might have a fling at studying nineteenth-century German drama. He couldn’t find anyone there who taught it, so he backtracked to the Sorbonne, where he called on a Jonathan Swift specialist whose name had been given him by an Oxford don. The Swift man welcomed him warmly and outlined what he thought was a bang-up subject for a doctoral thesis. His notion was that Geisel should explore the only period of Swift’s life, barring infancy, when he was not known to have written a single word—a stretch of several months in his teens. Though flattered at being thought capable of handling this scholarly opportunity, Geisel regarded it as depressingly negative in scope, and forthwith abandoned formal education for good. He took a cattle boat to Corsica, where he wrote a novel that has never been published, and then went to Italy. In November, 1927, he came home and married Miss Palmer, in New Jersey. The Geisels had decided to get married on the strength of his having sold a couple of cartoons to Judge. He signed them “Dr. Seuss,” feeling that he should save his patronym for more exalted artistic accomplishments and throwing in the title to give flair to the pseudonym. Over the next few years, he turned out a stream of cartoons and prose for Judge and for such other magazines as College Humor , Liberty , Vanity Fair, and the old Life . He made enough money to live in a Park Avenue apartment, where he produced, gratis, some of his most imaginative drawings for the customers of a neighborhood fish market that had a phone number differing from his by just one digit. On receiving a telephoned order for, say, two pounds of haddock, Geisel would obligingly draw a two-pound haddock, or what seemed to him a two-pound haddock, on an old shirt cardboard, and send it around to the customer. For Judge , one week, Geisel did a cartoon showing a huge beast nuzzling a bed on which lay a knight in armor. The caption went, “Mediaeval tenant: ‘Darn it all, another Dragon. And just after I’d sprayed the whole castle with Flit!’ ” A toss of a coin had impelled Geisel to make it Flit instead of FlyTox, another insecticide of the day, and it was a lucky toss, for the wife of a Flit advertising man picked up a copy of that Judge in a beauty parlor, and the next thing Geisel knew, he was under contract to do Flit ads. The famous “Quick, Henry! The Flit!” was the outcome. Actually, Geisel’s line for the first ad was “Quick, Mama! The Flit!,” and it accompanied a drawing of a cave boy clutched in a dinosaur’s jaws. Geisel did cartoons for Flit for seventeen years, varying his basic caption only occasionally, for the purpose of having, say, a bug-beset whale cry to a passenger in its jaws, “Quick, Jonah! The Flit!” The firm that made Flit was a subsidiary of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey (the only cartoon-ad idea that did not originate with Geisel or his wife was submitted by the first Mrs. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and while he can’t remember what it was, he recalls that it was droll), and every now and then he would be farmed out to another subsidiary, like the Essomarine fuel outfit. In this connection, he presided over a celebrated publicity stunt of the thirties—the Seuss Navy. The idea was spawned at the 1936 Motor Boat Show, and enrollment in the Navy was at first limited to owners of boats with inboard motors. Later, gossip columnists got in, some of them landlubbers. Every member was an admiral except Dr. Seuss, who was Admiral-in-Chief, and by 1940, when his Navy no longer seemed quite so funny, and petered out, it boasted a couple of thousand admirals. Its burgee was a Geisel-designed herring, mostly bones, and its official seal was a flippered seal. Annually, at Motor Boat Show time, Essomarine picked up the tab for a Seuss Navy banquet, attended by nearly a thousand admirals, whom Geisel would sonorously lead in an oath of allegiance to Mother Neptune—a mermaidlike creature he had rigged up out of a dressmaker’s dummy and a fishtail. “The Seuss Navy was a rather corny outfit,” Geisel says now. Geisel has toiled on many advertising campaigns over the years. For another Standard Oil offshoot, he created a series of bloodcurdling, or engine-curdling, monsters who roamed the nation’s billboards—the Moto-Raspus, the Zerodoccus, the Moto-Munchus, the Karbo-Nockus, and the Oilio-Gobelus. Geisel did his last billboard job in 1956. In that year, the La Jolla Town Council—of which he was, and still is, an active and conscientious member—issued a pamphlet, written and illustrated by Dr. Seuss, that merrily lambasted all billboards. It was an account of the rivalry of two Neanderthal business establishments—Guss’s Guss-ma-Tuss and Zaxx’s Zaxx-ma-Taxx—and it concluded with these lines: And, thus between them, with impunity They loused up the entire community. Sign after sign, after sign, until Their property values slumped to nil. And even the dinosaurs moved away From that messed-up spot in the U.S.A. Which is why our businessmen never shall Allow such to happen in La Jolla, Cal. On reading this, Geisel’s current billboard sponsor abruptly terminated his contract.

Geisel frequently says that his life has been a series of accidents, and it was pretty much accidental that he began writing books in the first place. Back in 1931, during his Judge and Esso days, the Viking Press asked him to illustrate, for a modest flat fee, a collection of schoolboys’ howlers that was to be brought out under the title “Boners.” The book and a sequel, “More Boners,” did very well, and Geisel looked on with envy as the author’s royalties piled up. “I suddenly realized there was no sense in just illustrating books,” he says. The following year, he wrote an ABC book, which consisted mainly of pictures of wacky animals of the kind that populate most of his books—a long-necked whizzleworp, for example, and a green-striped cholmondelet. Nobody was interested in publishing the book, but Dartmouth consolingly exhibited the manuscript. “The idea is obviously an excellent one,” an undergraduate critic commented in a campus publication, “but if juvenile impressions are as important as the child psychologists say they are, it is interesting to consider the strange new neuroses which such pictures could bring about.” Geisel shied away from trying another children’s book for four rears. Then, in 1936, while returning from a European trip, he became mesmerized, as he tells the tale, by the rhythm of the ship’s engines. “Da da da da de dum dum de da de de da ,” it went. To be sure, he could have come up with the identical rhythm merely by reciting “ ’Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house,” but one cannot anticipate inspiration. The words that seemed to him to fit his magic metre most neatly were “And to think that I saw it on Mulberry Street,” and within a few months he had written and illustrated a book with that title. A score of publishers rejected it. Then, one morning, while walking, manuscript in hand, along Madison Avenue, a byway to which his advertising stints often summoned him, he bumped into a Dartmouth contemporary, Marshall McClintock, who the day before had given the class of ’26 an upward nudge by becoming juvenile editor of the Vanguard Press, and who was aprowl for something to edit. Never did supply and demand more fortuitously collide. “Mulberry Street” has to do with a boy named Marco who, on the way home from school, sees an ordinary horse and wagon and progressively enlarges his recollection of them until his fancy has soared to rarefied descriptive heights. The book has gone through fifteen editions, totalling a hundred and twenty thousand copies; it has been read or dramatized on radio more than a hundred times; and it has been used in a fiction-writing course at N.Y.U. to illustrate what the instructor in charge called “the principle of intensification.” Deems Taylor based what he called “a set of variations for orchestra” on it, and in 1943 the New York Philharmonic played the piece at Carnegie Hall. Since “Mulberry Street,” Geisel has had just about every triumph conceivable for a writer of children’s books except one—he is largely without honor outside of his own country. It may have been easy for Deems Taylor to convert “Mulberry Street” into music, but there have been obvious difficulties in translating the bulk of Dr. Seuss’s work—most of which not only rhymes but deals with creatures called Nizzards, Ziffs, Zuffs, and Ham-ikka-Schnim-ikka-Schnam-ikka-Schnopps—into foreign languages. In Polish, for instance, a cat in a hat becomes a kot w kapeluszu , and a drum-tummied snumm a brzuchaty snumm —there evidently being no Polish word for “snumm.” In “The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins,” Geisel, who likes hats and once collected them, had some magicians chanting, “Winkibus, Tinkibus, Fotichee, Klay! Hat on this demon’s head, fly far away!” The Japanese translation of this book omitted the passage entirely. In Germany, a translator came up with “ Winkibus, Pinkibus, Lupf um die Eck. Hut von dem Hexerich, Fliege weit weg! ” The chant hasn’t yet been tried in Poland. A few Dr. Seuss books have been published in England, but they haven’t done especially well there. One reason may be the British have no word for “snumm,” either.

Geisel is a high-principled man, and most of his books have a moral—usually served up, like children’s medicine, in mild and palatable doses. In his books, might never makes right, the meek inherit the earth, and pride frequently goeth before a fall—usually a pratfall. When his “Horton Hears a Who!” came out, in 1954, the Times called it “probably the most moral tale since the first ‘Elsie Dinsmore,’ ” and the Des Moines Register characterized it as “a rhymed lesson in protection of minorities and their rights.” The hero, Horton, is an elephant who takes it upon himself, in the face of considerable scoffing, to champion the cause of a colony of Whos, microscopic creatures who inhabit a grain of dust. “A person’s a person, no matter how small,” Horton declares. In 1940, Geisel was working on an earlier Horton book, “Horton Hatches the Egg” (in this one Horton dutifully sits on an abandoned egg in a bird’s nest until, as a reward for his patience, he hatches a winged infant with the head of an elephant), when Paris fell to the Nazis. With Europe in turmoil and this country, to Geisel’s way of thinking, misguidedly complacent, he could not stick to the writing of children’s books, and instead began drawing cartoons that hit out at American isolationists. He was unable to find any newspaper publisher who felt that his political views needed airing until he ran into Virginia Vanderlip Schoales, an old friend, who was working on PM . Mrs. Schoales introduced him to Ralph Ingersoll, the editor of the paper, and Geisel at once became PM’s editorial cartoonist. While PM’s stated philosophy—that it was against people who pushed other people around—tied in very aptly with Horton’s view that a person’s a person regardless of size, some of Geisel’s friends, aware that he was then living on Park Avenue and that his major patron was Standard Oil, thought Ingersoll’s up-the-rebels journal an odd haven for him to have sailed into. (Actually, he was a no more incongruous figure there than Ingersoll himself, whose blood is very blue, or than Mrs. Schoales, the daughter of a bank president and the wife of a Morgan Stanley partner.) Geisel’s contributions to PM , like nearly everything else in that now defunct paper, were dead serious. He portrayed Pierre Laval as a louse on Hitler’s finger, and, for once drawing a reasonably recognizable animal, the archetypal Nazi as a particularly close-to-the-ground dachshund. This provoked so many protests from hundred-per-cent-American dachshund fanciers that he resolved never again to compete, artistically, with photographers and taxidermists. He depicted the America First Committee and the Nazi Party as Siamese twins linked by a straggly beard. This provoked some threats of a boycott against Standard Oil by a few irate isolationist customers, who thought the company’s right-hand advertising man was straying too far left. Geisel did three cartoons a week for PM and occasional drawings for the Treasury Department, the War Production Board, and Nelson Rockefeller’s Committee on Inter-American Affairs, but after the United States got into the war, he felt so out of the main current of events that at the end of 1942 he decided to join the armed forces. He was presently stationed in California, as an Army captain attached to Frank Capra’s celebrated wartime documentary-film-making unit, for which he wrote and directed scripts calculated to elevate G.I. morals and morale. In the fall of 1944, Geisel was shipped to Europe for a spell, in connection with his film work, and at General Omar Bradley’s headquarters in Luxembourg, he ran into Ingersoll, by then a lieutenant colonel. Ingersoll said he supposed that Geisel, like most Stateside tourists, would like to have a peek at some actual fighting while he was in the area—without, of course, getting too dangerously exposed. Unfolding a top-secret map, he studied it carefully and circled “Bastogne.” Then he summoned a jeep and urged Geisel to ride on up there and take in the sights. Geisel was trapped for three days in the Battle of the Bulge, eventually being rescued by the British. “Nobody came along and put up a sign saying, ‘This is the Battle of the Bulge,’ ” he explained later. “How was I supposed to know? I thought the fact that we didn’t seem to be able to find any friendly troops in any direction was just one of the normal occurrences of combat.” After Allied soldiers crossed the Rhine, Geisel had the task of lugging around an indoctrination film he’d worked on for future American occupation troops, with instructions to show it to generals in the field and obtain their imprimatur. The picture was a strong sermon against fraternization, and one point it kept hammering home was that in no circumstances should an American military man shake the hand of a German. (The ending of the finished product was somewhat tamer than the one Geisel had proposed, in which he had a Was Department narrator saying, “Just be a good soldier. Leave all the bungling to the State Department.”) One Army headquarters at which he paused with his can of anti-handshake film was in a captured German city, and he was invited to accompany some staff officers to a municipal reception. Geisel, by then a major, was under orders not to let the film out of his sight, and he dutifully carried it to the party, where he shortly found himself at the tail end of a line of officers being greeted, with ceremonious handshake, by their German hosts. As he moved forward, he ruefully shifted his burden from his right hand to his left so that he could follow the leader. Shortly before the first atomic bomb was exploded, Geisel returned to California, where he was ordered to come up with another film for postwar occupation troops—one that would keep them on the alert by reminding them that inattention could lead to a third world war. “Make that third war a real doozy, Geisel,” he was told. Seeking inspiration, he leafed through the magazine section of a recent Sunday Times , where his eye was caught by an article suggesting that there was enough latent energy in a tumbler of water, if man could ever figure out a way of harnessing it, to blow up half the earth. Without further ado, or further research, Geisel knocked out the draft of a script suggesting the possibility of unimaginably devastating explosions, and passed it along to his superiors. Two days later, the Pentagon was on the phone, urgently asking where he’d got his facts. “From the Times ,” he replied. “Burn your source of information, Geisel,” came the command. “Burn the Times ?” he asked. “Yes, and report by phone as soon as you’ve carried out your orders,” he was told. “I had long since thrown away the copy of the paper in question,” Geisel recalls, “but I wanted to be a good soldier, so I rushed my most reliable sergeant to an out-of-town news dealer, and he bought me a copy of the latest Times . We put it in a metal bucket and all marched out into a courtyard and stood in formation and gave the Boy Scout salute while a trusted lieutenant lit a match to it. Then I called Washington and said, ‘Mission accomplished, sir. We have burned the Times .’ ‘Well done, Geisel,’ I was told, and then they went on with the war.”

Mustered out, as a lieutenant colonel, early in 1946, Geisel proceeded to divide his time for several years between children’s books and motion pictures. With his wife, he wrote a documentary film about Japan, “Design for Death,” which won an Oscar in 1947, but which soured its authors on Hollywood values. The object of the picture was to show that the Japanese were at heart not much different from any other human beings (“A person’s a person, no matter how small”), and that they had allowed themselves to be dominated by a gang of ruthless leaders. One sequence, of which both Geisels were particularly fond, as illustrative of the serenity of Japanese culture, was devoted to sixteenth-century Japan. No actors were involved—just fog and water, with a muted tone poem as the musical background. While looking at some rushes one evening, the Geisels were horrified to discover that one of the producers had livened up this tranquil stretch with shots of American tanks barrelling through a crowd of shrieking Japanese. The producer refused to delete the tanks, on the ground that, anachronism or no anachronism, they gave the dreary old century some vitality. Just before the picture was released, the Geisels sneaked into a cutting room and, abetted by a film editor, snipped out the lively footage. The producer had the last word, though. Weeks later, when the Geisels passed a theatre where the film was playing, they found it advertised with posters that showed terrified white women in ripped chemises being carted off in cages by transparently ill-intentioned Japanese soldiers. On his own, Geisel invented the movie-cartoon character Gerald McBoing-Boing, whose adventures also won an Oscar, and he not only conceived but wrote the scenario and designed the sets and costumes for a full-length screen musical with live actors, called “The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.” This was a fantasy about a whipcracking music teacher, Dr. Terwilliker, who made five hundred boys practice their scales simultaneously day in and out at the keyboard of an enormous piano. Geisel wrote the words of twenty songs for the picture, too. Most of them were never used. One that was, “Ten Happy Fingers,” was supposed to be a satire on conventional piano exercises. The lyricist was bemused when a sheet-music publisher later brought it out as a conventional piano exercise. A hundred more or less piano-playing boys were hired for the movie, and Geisel has vivid memories of this group in action. “The kids were paid in cash,” he says, “and one day, during a violent rainstorm that flooded the studio, they descended on the commissary en masse. They all rapidly got sick on candy. It was like a nightmarish Noah’s Ark. Water was pouring in on the set, and the boys were moaning, and their mothers and their music teachers were all hopping up and down, and their ordinary teachers were running around trying to organize arithmetic classes, because the law said they should, and we had to call off work for three days and take the director to a hospital. It was the damnedest, nerve-rackingest, screamingest experience of my life.” Upon learning that a movie theatre in San Diego was holding the West Coast première of the picture and, as a special honor to him, was featuring his name on its marquee, Geisel became so edgy that he grabbed his wife and fled to Japan, explaining over his shoulder that he had some blocked yen in royalties that he wanted to spend. (The royalties, unsurprisingly, amounted to twenty-seven dollars and fifty cents.) He hasn’t seen the finished movie yet, he says, and he has never again worked for motion pictures. The Geisels had become addicted to California, though, if not to the movies. In 1948, they settled in La Jolla, a town of twenty thousand that was put on the map by the late E. W. Scripps. Among various La Jolla landmarks that the publisher endowed is the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, on whose staff is a Ph.D. named Hans Suess. He sometimes receives requests from first-grade teachers that have been addressed simply “Dr. Seuss, La Jolla,” and Geisel, in turn, receives requests from bathyorographically oriented professors. La Jolla is both a summer resort and a year-round haven for the retired, most of whom know their literary neighbor and are proud of him. La Jolla has four bookstores, and nearly every day one or another of them sends Geisel a batch of his books to be autographed for its customers. Many persons who spend vacations at La Jolla, moreover, order their Dr. Seuss books from La Jolla stores all the year round, to get them inscribed. During a couple of weeks last December, Geisel autographed a hundred and fifty Christmas-gift books a day. The highest spot in La Jolla is Mount Soledad, and it is on its summit that the Geisels live, in a pink stucco house they built around an observation tower, from which they can look out across the Pacific or down into Mexico. The tower was erected many years ago by a real-estate man, who used it to point out low-lying sites to prospects. When the Geisels bought the place, a lot of La Jollans were surprised; they had always believed that the tower, a favorite aerie for young couples, was municipally owned. When the Geisels moved in, they found the walls and beams of its topmost room covered with heart-framed initials and other romantic graffiti, many of them scribbled in lipstick, and Geisel insists that he removed five thousand empty beer cans from one of the closets. During the first few months after the Geisels took possession, sailors from the San Diego naval base and their girls would roll up to the house and head happily for the tower stairs. Even today, an occasional married couple who became engaged at the summit stop by to ask if they may make an anniversary visit to their former trysting place. The Geisels are also beleaguered by visitors who want to enjoy a view of Dr. Seuss. “It sometimes seems to me that half the teachers and librarians in America come to La Jolla for their holidays,” Geisel said wearily one evening last summer. He likes to work at night and sleep late, but for a while he was aroused at seven o’clock every Sunday morning by an idolatrous neighboring pack of Cub Scouts, who would hike across a ravine or two and ring his doorbell. “I would stagger downstairs and let them in,” Geisel says, “and the chief, or whatever he was, would announce cheerfully, ‘Well, here we are!’ Then they’d all march inside and sit down. I would be too groggy to say anything, and they would be too winded. One morning, we all sat and stared at each other for five minutes without exchanging a word, and finally one eight-year-old piped up, ‘We saw a snake on the way over.’ Then we all sat for another five minutes, until Helen rescued me by handing out cookies and easing them out. Eventually, I got them to quit through a friend who knew a cousin of a Scoutmaster.” Notwithstanding such impressive demonstrations of popularity, Geisel still finds it hard to believe in his own renown. A few months ago, he tried unavailingly, through somebody else’s cousin, to wangle an introduction to an eminent dowager he had admired from afar; he ultimately met her after she had stood in line for an hour at a bookstore autographing session, holding a copy of a book of his that she wanted inscribed for a grandchild. In 1956, some of the illustrations for his books were exhibited at the San Diego Fine Arts Gallery. Just before the opening night, Geisel expressed grave doubts about whether anyone would show up. When he himself did, he was instantly pounced on by a mob of three or four hundred children and parents, who pinned him against a wall and kept him at bay for more than an hour. As a trustee of the gallery, Geisel is busy these days helping map plans for a children’s wing to be added to it, which the museum hopes to call the Dr. Seuss Wing. Five years ago, he wrote and acted in an “Omnibus” television show devoted to an imaginary Seuss Museum. It differed from the general run of museums in that children going through it were not forbidden to touch the displays; on the contrary, the exhibits were all marked “Do Touch.” Geisel, who dedicated “Happy Birthday to You!” to “my good friends, the Children of San Diego County,” hopes that the new museum, toward which he has contributed substantially, will carry out this idea, at least to a degree. “I want a museum that will have a real, operable printing press alongside a shelf of books, and blocks of wood and chisels alongside woodcuts, so that children can watch and work at the same time,” he says. “I want every kid in San Diego to be able to blow a glass bottle while looking at some Venetian glass, and to make a tapestry in front of a Gobelin.” Geisel used to do most of his writing and drawing in any corner of his house that happened to be reasonably uncluttered. A few years ago, Ray Freiman, the production manager at Random House, told him he really ought to provide himself with, and certainly could afford, a permanent and comfortable studio. Geisel obediently built a spacious atelier on the Pacific side of his tower. The room has cork walls, on which he can tack the illustrations for a work in progress. His desk, which is littered with cans and jars of brushes and pens, seems to indicate that he regards himself as artist first and writer second, for it is a drafting table, with a sloping work surface; he keeps his typewriter on top of it, and types at a tilt. Ideas come hard to Geisel, and their implementation is a drawn-out, painful process. Once, he says, he chanced to sketch an elephant on an old pad of tracing paper. Afterward, he saw that he had superimposed the animal on a previously doodled tree in such a manner as to make the elephant seem perched in it. “I stopped, dumbfounded,” he says. “I said to myself, ‘That’s a hell of a situation. An elephant in a tree! What’s he doing there?’ I brooded over it for three or four weeks, and finally I said to myself, ‘Of course! He’s hatching an egg!’ ” This is his conscious recollection of the genesis of “Horton Hatches the Egg,” but his subconscious might demur, since he had done a cartoon for Judge , years before, showing a whale in a tree. Being harshly self-critical, Geisel at one point or another in the evolution of each of his books has hurled his accumulated words and pictures onto the floor or into a fireplace, whence they are customarily retrieved by his wife and restored to his hands when he is in a less fractious mood. Perfectionism is his creed. He insists on retyping a page of copy if one word has been crossed out, and he has spent up to three days worrying about the appositeness of a single adjective. It is his habit, once he has finished a book, to deliver it in person to Random House, and as the time for setting off cross country draws near, he becomes increasingly morose. The night before he heads East, he usually goes without sleep. He spreads the pages of his book out on the floor of his living room and crawls back and forth in anguish among them, hovering over the composite parts with the awkward concern of his brood elephant. Sometimes, for last-minute advice or plain bucking up, he summons his next-door neighbor, a seventy-five-year-old businessman named Bert L. Hupp—one of the few people around, aside from Mrs. Geisel, in whose judgment of Dr. Seuss’s output Geisel has any faith. Hupp, who is the board chairman of the Sunshine Biscuit Company and was formerly a director of the Santa Fe Railroad, drops to his knees, too, and encourages Geisel with the kind of pep talk that a football coach might deliver in a locker room. When Random House hears that Geisel is on the way with another pot of gold, excitement runs high, and when he arrives, all hands convene in the office of Louise Bonino, the juvenile editor, for a reading and showing of the latest Dr. Seuss. Even the switchboard operators have been known to leave their post, to the consternation of television producers, lecture agents, Nobel Prize winners, and other outsiders vainly seeking the ear of Bennett Cerf. Geisel, always a high-strung man, is at his tensest during these performances. At the close of one of them, he retreated in dejection to the Madison Hotel, where he usually stays while in New York, and spent a week rewriting three pages, because he felt that nobody at Random House had laughed hard enough at them. Many authors who have turned in a manuscript and learned that it has been accepted are happy to leave the technicalities of its transformation into a book up to their publishers. Not Geisel. Invading the production department, he will dump three or four moldy bits of crayon, or some scraps torn from matchbooks, onto Ray Freiman’s desk and say that they are precisely the shades of color he wants used in this or that illustration. That it is often extremely difficult to match up printing ink with crayon does not bother him. Random House has learned to ride with his punches. “From a genius you tolerate a little bit more,” one editor there has observed. Just to keep Geisel pacified, his publisher spends twenty-five per cent more on the paper in his books than on that in any other author’s, and two or three times as much as the norm on preparing his color plates for the press. Nevertheless, Geisel still complains loudly if, in the thirteenth or fourteenth printing of one of his works, he perceives one color to be a tiny bit off register. After more than a hundred thousand copies of “The Cat in the Hat Comes Back” had been sold, he decided that a single black line on the original jacket was too black, and a new jacket was made up. In this vigorous policing of his output he is encouraged by his neighbor Hupp, who keeps telling him, as they jointly prune a camellia or spray a lemon tree in La Jolla, “Be tough. Keep your standards up. It’s your product, and don’t you let anybody talk you into letting it slip.”"

493,http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/31/why-corrupt-bankers-avoid-jail,newyorker,Why Corrupt Bankers Avoid Jail,[],"In the summer of 2012, a subcommittee of the U.S. Senate released a report so brimming with international intrigue that it read like an airport paperback. Senate investigators had spent a year looking into the London-based banking group HSBC, and discovered that it was awash in skulduggery. According to the three-hundred-and-thirty-four-page report, the bank had laundered billions of dollars for Mexican drug cartels, and violated sanctions by covertly doing business with pariah states. HSBC had helped a Saudi bank with links to Al Qaeda transfer money into the United States. Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel, which is responsible for tens of thousands of murders, deposited so much drug money in the bank that the cartel designed special cash boxes to fit HSBC’s teller windows. On a law-enforcement wiretap, one drug lord extolled the bank as “ the place to launder money.” With four thousand offices in seventy countries and some forty million customers, HSBC is a sprawling organization. But, in the judgment of the Senate investigators, all this wrongdoing was too systemic to be a matter of mere negligence. Senator Carl Levin, who headed the investigation, declared, “This is something that people knew was going on at that bank.” Half a dozen HSBC executives were summoned to Capitol Hill for a ritual display of chastisement. Stuart Gulliver, the bank’s C.E.O., said that he was “profoundly sorry.” Another executive, who had been in charge of compliance, announced during his testimony that he would resign. Few observers would have described the banking sector as a hotbed of ethical compunction, but even by the jaundiced standards of the industry HSBC’s transgressions were extreme. Lanny Breuer, a senior official at the Department of Justice, promised that HSBC would be “held accountable.” What Breuer delivered, however, was the sort of velvet accountability to which large banks have grown accustomed: no criminal charges were filed, and no executives or employees were prosecuted for trafficking in dirty money. Instead, HSBC pledged to clean up its institutional culture, and to pay a fine of nearly two billion dollars: a penalty that sounded hefty but was only the equivalent of four weeks’ profit for the bank. The U.S. criminal-justice system might be famously unyielding in its prosecution of retail drug crimes and terrorism, but a bank that facilitated such activity could get away with a rap on the knuckles. A headline in the Guardian tartly distilled the absurdity: “HSBC ‘Sorry’ for Aiding Mexican Drug Lords, Rogue States and Terrorists.” In the years since the mortgage crisis of 2008, it has become common to observe that certain financial institutions and other large corporations may be “too big to jail.” The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, which investigated the causes of the meltdown, concluded that the mortgage-lending industry was rife with “predatory and fraudulent practices.” In 2011, Ray Brescia, a professor at Albany Law School who had studied foreclosure procedures, told Reuters, “I think it’s difficult to find a fraud of this size . . . in U.S. history.” Yet federal prosecutors filed no criminal indictments against major banks or senior bankers related to the mortgage crisis. Even when the authorities uncovered less esoteric, easier-to-prosecute crimes—such as those committed by HSBC—they routinely declined to press charges. This regime, in which corporate executives have essentially been granted immunity, is relatively new. After the savings-and-loan crisis of the nineteen-eighties, prosecutors convicted nearly nine hundred people, and the chief executives of several banks went to jail. When Rudy Giuliani was the top federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, he liked to march financiers off the trading floor in handcuffs. If the rules applied to mobsters like Fat Tony Salerno, Giuliani once observed, they should apply “to big shots at Goldman Sachs, too.” As recently as 2006, when Enron imploded, such titans as Jeffrey Skilling and Kenneth Lay were convicted of conspiracy and fraud. Something has changed in the past decade, however, and federal prosecutions of white-collar crime are now at a twenty-year low. As Jesse Eisinger, a reporter for ProPublica, explains in a new book, “The Chickenshit Club: Why the Justice Department Fails to Prosecute Executives” (Simon & Schuster), a financial crisis has traditionally been followed by a legal crackdown, because a market contraction reveals all the wishful accounting and outright fraud that were hidden when the going was good. In Warren Buffett’s memorable formulation, “You only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.” After the mortgage crisis, people in Washington and on Wall Street expected prosecutions. Eisinger reels off a list of potential candidates for criminal charges: Countrywide, Washington Mutual, Lehman Brothers, Citigroup, A.I.G., Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley. Although fines were paid, and the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission referred dozens of cases to prosecutors, there were no indictments, no trials, no jail time. As Eisinger writes, “Passing on one investigation is understandable; passing on every single one starts to speak to something else.” “Due to an earlier incident, this train is being held in the station. Please be patient—we will be moving shortly.”

One morning in February, 1975, a fifty-three-year-old businessman named Eli Black took the elevator to the forty-fourth floor of the Pan Am Building, in Manhattan. When he was alone in his corner office, Black slammed his attaché case into one of the big windows overlooking the city until the glass broke. Then he jumped out. Black was the chairman of United Brands, a multibillion-dollar conglomerate. After his death, friends speculated that he had been working too hard, but an alert investigator at the Securities and Exchange Commission, Stanley Sporkin, grew suspicious, noting that people don’t just “drop out of windows for no reason.” Black, it emerged, had become embroiled in a bribery scheme. United Brands owned Chiquita, and in exchange for a reduction of the export tax on bananas Black had authorized a two-and-a-half-million-dollar bribe to the President of Honduras. “White-collar crime,” in the definition of the sociologist who coined the term in the nineteen-thirties, is “committed by a person of respectability and high social status in the course of his occupation.” Eli Black fit the criteria. But he was dead. Sporkin, determined to secure justice, enlisted a young federal prosecutor in New York, Jed Rakoff, who devised a clever work-around: charge the whole company. Under U.S. law, it was technically possible to hold a company responsible for the actions of a single employee. With their inventive legal minds and their tenacious pursuit of malefactors, Sporkin and Rakoff are two of the heroes in Eisinger’s deeply reported account. United Brands ended up pleading guilty to conspiracy and wire fraud, and though it got off with a token fine of fifteen thousand dollars, Congress later cited the case when it passed the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in 1977. Before the United Brands scandal, prosecutors tended to go after white-collar crimes by indicting the executives who committed them; now they charged the firms themselves. But the notion of prosecuting a corporation raises a number of tricky questions. A company, as an eighteenth-century British jurist once remarked, has “no soul to be damned, and no body to be kicked.” Corporations can own property, sue people and be sued, even assert First Amendment rights. But you can’t put a corporation in jail. So you impose a fine. The trouble is that the employees responsible don’t pay the fine: if the company is publicly traded, the shareholders do. These individuals may have benefitted from the felonious conduct if it inflated the value of their stock, but they are innocent of any crime. The very conception of the modern corporation is that it limits individual liability. Yet, in the decades after the United Brands case, prosecutors often pursued both errant executives and the companies they worked for. When the investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert was suspected of engaging in stock manipulation and insider trading, in the nineteen-eighties, prosecutors levelled charges not just against financiers at the firm, including Michael Milken, but also against the firm itself. (Drexel Burnham pleaded guilty, and eventually shut down.) After the immense fraud at Enron was exposed, federal authorities pursued its accounting company, Arthur Andersen, for helping to cook the books. Arthur Andersen executives, desperate to cover their tracks, deleted tens of thousands of e-mails and shredded documents by the ton. In 2002, Arthur Andersen was convicted of obstruction of justice, and lost its accounting license. The corporation, which had tens of thousands of employees, was effectively put out of business. Eisinger describes the demise of Arthur Andersen as a turning point. Many lawyers, particularly in the well-financed realm of white-collar criminal defense, regarded the case as a flagrant instance of government overreach: the problem with convicting a company was that it could have “collateral consequences” that would be borne by employees, shareholders, and other innocent parties. “The Andersen case ushered in an era of prosecutorial timidity,” Eisinger writes. “Andersen had to die so that all other big corporations might live.” With plenty of encouragement from high-end lobbyists, a new orthodoxy soon took hold that some corporations were so colossal—and so instrumental to the national economy—that even filing criminal charges against them would be reckless. In 2013, Eric Holder, then the Attorney General, acknowledged that decades of deregulation and mergers had left the U.S. economy heavily consolidated. It was therefore “difficult to prosecute” the major banks, because indictments could “have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy.” Prosecutors came to rely instead on a type of deal, known as a deferred-prosecution agreement, in which the company would acknowledge wrongdoing, pay a fine, and pledge to improve its corporate culture. From 2002 to 2016, the Department of Justice entered into more than four hundred of these arrangements. Having spent a trillion dollars to bail out the banks in 2008 and 2009, the federal government may have been loath to jeopardize the fortunes of those banks by prosecuting them just a few years later. But fears of collateral consequences also inhibited the administration of justice in more run-of-the-mill instances of criminal money laundering. Some officials in the Department of Justice wanted to indict HSBC, according to e-mails unearthed by a subsequent congressional investigation. But Britain’s Chancellor of the Exchequer warned U.S. authorities that a prosecution could lead to “very serious implications for financial and economic stability.” HSBC was granted a deferred-prosecution agreement.

Numerous explanations have been offered for the failure of the Obama Justice Department to hold the big banks accountable: corporate lobbying in Washington, appeals-court rulings that tightened the definitions of certain types of corporate crime, the redirecting of investigative resources after 9/11. But Eisinger homes in on a subtler factor: the professional psychology of élite federal prosecutors. “The Chickenshit Club” is about a specific vocational temperament. When James Comey took over as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, in 2002, Eisinger tells us, he summoned his young prosecutors for a pep talk. For graduates of top law schools, a job as a federal prosecutor is a brass ring, and the Southern District of New York, which has jurisdiction over Wall Street, is the most selective office of them all. Addressing this ferociously competitive cohort, Comey asked, “Who here has never had an acquittal or a hung jury?” Several go-getters, proud of their unblemished records, raised their hands. But Comey, with his trademark altar-boy probity, had a surprise for them. “You are members of what we like to call the Chickenshit Club,” he said. “He’s all right, but I’m looking for a guy who can really make me laugh.” Most people who go to law school are risk-averse types. With their unalloyed drive to excel, the élite young attorneys who ascend to the Southern District have a lifetime of good grades to show for it. Once they become prosecutors, they are invested with extraordinary powers. In a world of limited public resources and unlimited wrongdoing, prosecutors make decisions every day about who should be charged and tried, who should be allowed to plead, and who should be let go. This is the front line of criminal justice, and decisions are made unilaterally, with no review by a judge. Even in the American system of checks and balances, there are few fetters on a prosecutor’s discretion. A perfect record of convictions and guilty pleas might signal simply that you’re a crackerjack attorney. But, as Comey implied, it could also mean that you’re taking only those cases you’re sure you’ll win—the lawyerly equivalent of enrolling in a gut class for the easy A. You might suppose that the glory of convicting a blue-chip C.E.O. would be irresistible. But taking such a case to trial entails serious risk. In contemporary corporations, the decision-making process is so diffuse that it can be difficult to establish criminal culpability beyond a reasonable doubt. In the United Brands case, Eli Black directly authorized the bribe, but these days the precise author of corporate wrongdoing is seldom so clear. Even after a provision in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, of 2002, began requiring C.E.O.s and C.F.O.s to certify the accuracy of corporate financial reports, few executives were charged with violating the law, because the companies threw up a thicket of subcertifications to buffer accountability. As Samuel Buell, who helped prosecute the Enron and Andersen cases and is now a law professor at Duke, points out in his recent book, “Capital Offenses: Business Crime and Punishment in America’s Corporate Age,” an executive’s claim that he believed he was following the rules often poses “a severe, even disabling, obstacle to prosecution.” That is doubly so in instances where the alleged crime is abstruse. Even the professionals who bought and sold the dodgy mortgage-backed instruments that led to the financial crisis often didn’t understand exactly how they worked. How do you explicate such transactions—and prove criminal intent—to a jury? Even with an airtight case, going to trial is always a gamble. Lose a white-collar criminal trial and you become a symbol of prosecutorial overreach. You might even set back the cause of corporate accountability. Plus, you’ll have a ding on your record. Eisinger quotes one of Lanny Breuer’s deputies in Washington telling a prosecutor, “If you lose this case, Lanny will have egg on his face.” Such fears can deter the most ambitious and scrupulous of young attorneys. The deferred-prosecution agreement, by contrast, is a sure thing. Companies will happily enter into such an agreement, and even pay an enormous fine, if it means avoiding prosecution. “That rewards laziness,” David Ogden, a Deputy Attorney General in the Obama Administration, tells Eisinger. “The department gets publicity, stats, and big money. But the enormous settlements may or may not reflect that they could actually prove the case.” When companies agree to pay fines for misconduct, the agreements they sign are often conspicuously stinting in details about what they did wrong. Many agreements acknowledge criminal conduct by the corporation but do not name a single executive or officer who was responsible. “The Justice Department argued that the large fines signaled just how tough it had been,” Eisinger writes. “But since these settlements lacked transparency, the public didn’t receive basic information about why the agreement had been reached, how the fine had been determined, what the scale of the wrongdoing was and which cases prosecutors never took up.” These pas de deux between prosecutors and corporate chieftains came to feel “stage-managed, rather than punitive.”

White-collar crime is not the only area in which prosecutors show reluctance to risk a trial. By the time Comey issued his Chickenshit Club admonition, a deeper shift in the administration of justice was already under way. Faced with the challenges of entrusting any criminal case to a jury, prosecutors were increasingly skipping trial altogether, negotiating a plea bargain instead. With the introduction of stiff sentencing guidelines, prosecutors routinely “up charged” crimes, requesting maximal prison sentences in the event of a conviction at trial. Defendants can be risk-averse, too. Offered the choice between, say, pleading guilty and serving three to five years, or going to trial and serving ten if convicted, many opt for the former. But, as with corporate deferred-prosecution agreements, these arrangements grant prosecutors a victory without testing their evidence in court. Rachel Barkow, a law professor at N.Y.U., has pointed out that when you threaten defendants with Draconian sentences if they refuse to plead guilty “you penalize people who have the nerve to go to trial.” Some scholars argue that such prosecutorial bullying may violate the Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury. (In 2014, a federal judge in Colorado declared that, for most Americans, this constitutional right is now “a myth.”) The criminal trial is increasingly becoming a relic. More than ninety-five per cent of all criminal cases at both the state and the federal level are now resolved in plea bargains. A recent article in the Times described vacant courtrooms, out-of-work stenographers, and New York judges who can go a year or more without hearing a single criminal case. It may be no accident that the vanishing of the criminal trial has coincided with Eisinger’s story of vanishing corporate accountability. Presenting a case to a jury is a skill, and prosecutors now have fewer opportunities to hone it. The less adept you are in the courtroom, the more intimidated you will be by the prospect of going to trial, making you more likely to opt for a plea agreement instead. This phenomenon has broader societal consequences. As John Pfaff demonstrates in his recent book, “Locked In,” one grave result of the tremendous leverage that prosecutors exert is the rise of mass incarceration. As judges and juries are written out of the criminal-justice equation, an awful paradox has emerged: the poor sign plea bargains and go to jail; the privileged sign deferred-prosecution agreements and avoid it. This is a curious state of affairs, given that the notion of deferring criminal prosecution was originally introduced to benefit individuals, not corporations. During the nineteen-sixties, pilot programs in New York and Washington, D.C., demonstrated that when charges were suspended for ninety days, so that low-income defendants who had been arrested for nonviolent crimes could obtain counselling and job-placement services, offenders often turned their lives around to a point where the charges were dropped. This approach was both humane and efficient, in that it diverted people from the costly prison system. Among those who completed the program, few were arrested again. In 1974, following the success of such initiatives, the deferred-prosecution agreement was incorporated into federal law. It is a pernicious irony that a progressive legal instrument designed to help working-class defendants stay out of jail has been repurposed as a vehicle for facilitating corporate impunity. As the federal judge Emmet Sullivan noted in 2015, “Drug conspiracy defendants are no less deserving of a second chance than bribery conspiracy defendants.” Yet these days the Department of Justice seldom offers this form of clemency to the kinds of individuals for whom the practice was conceived. Perhaps, as Eric Holder has argued, there is simply more at stake when the defendant is a major bank. But what about the collateral consequences of showing less mercy when prosecuting low-income individuals? When you charge someone with a felony and send him to prison, the repercussions radiate outward, through his family and his community. Nearly three million American children have a parent in prison. According to the Rutgers criminologist Todd Clear, low-income neighborhoods in which a large proportion of the population cycles in and out of confinement experience greater familial dysfunction, warped labor markets, and a general lack of “mental and physical health.” Entire communities bear the brunt of our zealous approach to less rarefied varieties of crime. Prosecutors and judges seldom regard those collateral costs as a rationale for leniency."

Then the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture issued an injunction against the twenty-three-year-old pop star, who was in the middle of a global tour, prohibiting him from performing in China. (On Monday, Bieber announced that he was cutting his tour short.) “Justin Bieber is a gifted singer,” the bureau acknowledged, in a statement released on July 21st. “But in order to maintain order in the Chinese market and purify the Chinese performance environment, it is not suitable to bring in badly behaved entertainers.”

The Chinese government, which is not in the habit of divulging the logic of its edicts, didn’t elaborate on the “bad behavior” that got Bieber blacklisted, but one can imagine that his past visits to Asia may have had something to do with it. It’s unlikely, for instance, that being carried up the Great Wall by bodyguards, as the pop star did on a tour in 2013, won him plaudits from Beijing officials. Even worse was Bieber’s infamous 2014 visit to Tokyo’s Yasukuni Shrine, which honors the war dead, including those who inflicted atrocities upon Chinese and Korean civilians before and during the Second World War. Bieber, who seemed to have stumbled upon the shrine by chance, posted photos of his visit to Instagram with the same thoughtless self-assurance that led him to muse, on a visit to the Anne Frank House, the following year, that he hoped the teen-age Holocaust victim “would have been a belieber.” Apparently, the Biebs is slow to learn a lesson.

Of course, Bieber is far from the first celebrity that the Chinese government has attempted to ban from the country. In 2008, at a concert in Shanghai, the Icelandic singer Björk infuriated officials by shouting “Tibet, Tibet” at the end of her song “Declare Independence.” In response, China’s culture ministry issued a statement proclaiming that “any artistic group or individual who has ever engaged in activities which threaten our national sovereignty will not be allowed in.” The ban also included entertainers who “threaten national unity” and “violate religious policy or cultural norms.” Since then, the ministry, which vets all foreign acts, has denied entry to everyone from Oasis and Lady Gaga to Brad Pitt and Richard Gere for their embrace of the Free Tibet movement. In 2012, when Elton John dedicated a performance in Beijing “to the spirit and talent” of Ai Weiwei , the Chinese dissident artist and activist, he was interviewed by the police immediately after the performance.

What sets Bieber apart from previous celebrities non gratae, though, is the relatively apolitical nature of his violations, which presumably stem more from childish stupidity or swaggering bravado than from a calculated campaign of dissent. Yet the Chinese government’s refusal to let Bieber’s antics slide signals the shifting nature of censorship in a country that is trying to reconcile its system of stringent political control with the porousness of modern culture. In the age of globalization and social media, cultural hegemony knows no borders: a global pop icon—even a merely feckless, insolent one—can threaten to infiltrate an autocratic state, forcing its leaders to reappraise the meaning and methodology of maintaining “order” and “purity.”

Bieber’s behavior might seem innocuous enough to a Western audience (he has, after all, devoted considerable energy to saying sorry ), but consider it in contrast to that of TFBoys, a prodigiously popular boy band that has been called “China’s answer to Justin Bieber: young, fresh and cute.” Instead of singing about crushes and bubble-gum romance, the Fighting Boys, as they are known, croon about homework, the joy of domestic chores, and their hopes of winning the Nobel Prize. In 2014, the year after the band was founded—the same year Bieber was caught peeing in a mop bucket in public—its lead singer, Junkai Wang, posted a video of himself singing wistfully about the responsibilities that come with getting older; it was shared more than a hundred and fifty million times. Chinese observers have called the band’s three members “the teen-age sons every mother dreams about.” They are also the kind of performers that China’s state-controlled media dream about. In 2015, the band released a song and music video titled “We are the Heirs of Communism,” which opens on a schoolyard of solemn children sporting their Communist red scarves and goes on to praise the glories of the Party. Last year, the group was invited to perform in CCTV’s New Year’s Gala, an annual state-sponsored televised variety show, which melds entertainment with nationalistic propaganda—and happens to be the most watched show in the world.

To the Chinese government, Justin Bieber is a “controversial young foreigner” because even his apolitical antics represent a reckless individualism that’s perilous to the Party’s mission of insuring loyalty. The scope and spread of Western pop culture, with its potent, if indirect, messages of rebellious aspiration and individual desire, are inherently disturbing to an authoritarian state that likes to think of its citizens as dependent and governable children. Ground rules must be set, and corrupting influences extricated early, even in a family of 1.4 billion. In its statement last week, the culture bureau’s spokesperson wrote, in the tone of an irritated teacher penning her midterm report, that, “as Justin Bieber matures,” she hopes that “he may continue to improve his own words and actions and truly become a singer beloved by the public.” Whether Bieber will mature beyond his juvenile escapades is an open question, but one thing is clear: to be a performer admitted within China’s borders, it is the love of the Party—not the public—that counts."
