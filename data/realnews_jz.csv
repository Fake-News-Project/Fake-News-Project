1,http://www.nbcnews.com/better/business/how-college-students-can-avoid-overdraft-late-fees-ncna774051,nbcnews,How college students (and the rest of us) can avoid overdraft and late fees,[],"As if college isn't expensive enough — and at an average $24,610 for a year at an in-state public college and twice that at a private one — today's college students seem intent on adding substantially to their bills. The culprit? Overdraft and late payment fees. Over four years of school, those charges add another $1,016 for the average student, according to NerdWallet. In total, U.S. college students spend more than $795 million a year on overdraft and late payment fees. And every penny of that spending is unnecessary.

So, if you're sending a child off to school this fall here's what they need to know to keep the money in their bank accounts — where it belongs.

Skip Overdraft “Protection”

Overdraft protection can be a misnomer, says millennial money expert Stephanie O’Connell. Essentially, the ""protection"" is assurance that if you pay for something, your purchase will go through even if the money isn't there. But no one is protecting you from overdraft fees. The average bank overdraft fee is currently $35, at credit unions it's a somewhat more reasonable $27.76, according to to a Bankrate.com survey.

To make matters worse, some financial institutions reorder your day’s transactions from highest to lowest amount (rather than in the time order in which you make them), so that if you do overdraw, you may end up paying more than one fee (once for the high charge if it’s more than your balance, then once for each lower charge after that). This can really add up. “If you got charged three overdraft fees in one day, you’re paying $100,” says O’Connell. “What else would you want to do with $100?”

The fix: Don’t sign up for overdraft protection — and if you’ve already got it, call and opt out. “You could buy a $5 sandwich and wind up with a $35 fee for it,” says NerdWallet personal finance columnist Liz Weston. Opting out means that if you do try to buy something your balance doesn’t cover, your debit card will be declined — but a moment of embarrassment at checkout is likely worth the high-fee alternative. One key thing to remember: If you opt out of overdraft protection and have a credit card, it’s important to make certain you have enough in your checking account every month to pay the credit card bill. If you don’t, your payment will be declined, and a late or missed payment can result in higher fees, interest rates and a lasting impact on your credit score. More on that in a minute.

U.S. college students spend more than $795 million a year on overdraft and late payment fees. And every penny of that spending is unnecessary.

Alerts and Auto-Pay Are Your Friend

Visit your financial institution and credit card company websites, and in the settings sections, turn on as many alerts as you can — for low balances, transactions above X amount, purchases made by phone or online and reminders about payment due dates. It’s also a good idea to sign up for daily account balance reminders so you’re never in the dark about how much you have. The NerdWallet analysis we mentioned before studied overdraft fees and late fees, and those late payments can result in fees and a lower credit score over time. Worst of all, they can turn into skipped payments — which could knock 100 points or more off your credit score, taking up to three years to recover, says Weston.

RELATED: Cosigning a Loan? Your Credit Score Will Drop and You’ll Retire Later

The fix: Set up automatic minimum payments from your checking account to your credit card as well as other bills (health club, car insurance, etc.) you pay on a regular basis. For those credit cards, set an amount you're sure will cover the minimum, then when your bill arrives use that as a nudge to go back and adjust the amount you owe. Each month before your payments are due, set a calendar reminder to check your balance to make sure you have enough to cover it.

Remember: It’s vital to try to pay your card off in full every single month, so don’t charge more than you can afford. Try to minimize the urge to charge by thinking about your long-term goals (a.k.a. spring break or that trip you want to take after graduation rather than today's lunch), says Benjamin Keys, assistant professor at The Wharton School. Getting into credit card debt during college, when you likely don't have much of an income, can mean incurring a mountain of interest. Ask yourself before every purchase: Do I need this? Do I really, really want it?

Students Aren't Given a Banking Break

Finally, when you make your choices about where to bank, keep overall costs — including account maintenance fees — to a minimum. There are plenty of free checking accounts available, Weston notes. Yet, she says, ""colleges often steer [students] to options that might not be the best for them.” Step one to combat this? Be aware that just because something is marketed as a student checking account or a student credit card, that doesn’t necessarily make it the best product for your needs. “A trap people fall into is they take the first account they’re given without actually looking at what the fees are, what the fine print is. What are the terms and conditions?” O’Connell adds.

RELATED: Beware Hidden College Costs: Here’s What Financial Aid Doesn’t Cover

The fix: Compare fees at the brick-and-mortar banks on campus. If you're not satisfied, consider an online financial institution, many of which don’t have fees or account minimums. Personal finance blog PT Money lists some of the best options here. The one thing to watch out for? ATM fees. Yes, you can Venmo your friends and swipe for just about everything else, but if you want to grab cash from a machine that doesn't belong to your bank it can cost $2 to $3 a pop. Be realistic about how often you'll do that and factor the likely monthly ATM fees into your decision.

The Takeaway

Never assume anyone has your best interest at heart. Do your own research on checking accounts and credit cards, and don't be afraid to ask about fees and fine print. Set up alerts and reminders for all your accounts, and schedule automatic minimum payments for credit cards (but try your best to manually pay them off in full every month). Opt out of overdraft protection with your financial institution, but every month before your credit card payment rolls around, make sure your balance is enough to cover it.

EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's expense reports from March, April and May were released following a Freedom of Information request filed by Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit watchdog group.

The records show Pruitt traveled home at least 10 times, typically leaving Washington on Fridays and returning on Mondays. Pruitt was either in Oklahoma or on trips that included stops there for nearly half the days encompassed in the three-month period, costing more than $15,000.

EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman did not respond to emails or phone messages from The Associated Press on Monday seeking comment.

Pruitt, a Republican, served as Oklahoma's attorney general prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump to lead EPA. Married with two children, Pruitt owns a home in Tulsa, Oklahoma. There were a couple of occasions where Pruitt traveled on a trip for EPA and then paid out-of-pocket to fly to Tulsa before returning to Washington at government expense.

AP reported earlier this year that while Pruitt was in his state job, he was in frequent contact with political donors, corporate executives and industry groups opposed to new environmental regulations enacted under the Obama administration.

He appears to have continued that practice since coming to EPA, including traveling to accept an award from the Oklahoma Well Strippers Association, making a keynote address to a meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council and delivering a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers.

EPA records indicate Pruitt also attended ""informational meetings"" during the trips, which were first reported by The New York Times. Though a trip to Oklahoma might last three or five days, it was not unusual for only one such meeting to be listed during Pruitt's time away from Washington.

An example is Pruitt's reported trip to Tulsa on Friday, May 19, on a flight scheduled to depart Washington at 5:37 p.m. The listed purpose of the trip was an ""informational meeting"" at the Brainerd Chemical Company in Tulsa. Pruitt's return flight to Washington was scheduled to depart the following Monday morning at 6 a.m. local time.

Records show EPA paid $1,980 for Pruitt's roundtrip ticket on a commercial airline, well in excess of what an economy class ticket typically costs on that route. Federal regulations allow government travelers to fly business class or first class only when no cheaper options are ""reasonably available."" Pruitt was also reimbursed $127 for meals and expenses, according to the records.

Among the questions to which Bowman did not respond was whether EPA staff or members of Pruitt's full-time security detail traveled with him. She also did not answer questions about the official purpose of specific trips or whether Pruitt flew first class.

A call to the family-owned distribution company's chairman, Mat Brainerd, was not immediately returned. He testified before congressional panels in favor of extending the Keystone XL oil pipeline and against part of the Clean Air Act.

Related: Scott Pruitt Questions Human Impact on Climate Change

In a statement to the Times, Bowman said: ""The administrator's travel, whether to Utah, Michigan or Oklahoma, all serves the purpose of hearing from hard-working Americans about how EPA can better serve the American people.""

On a different May trip, records show Pruitt flew to Colorado to give a speech to the Heritage Foundation before buying his own ticket to Tulsa for the weekend and then returning to Washington. On that trip, EPA paid $2,690 in commercial airfare.

The Heritage Foundation, a free-market think tank that receives funding from groups tied to the fossil-fuel industry, paid for Pruitt's hotel room in Colorado Springs, according to his travel form. Though Pruitt's expense report indicates an ""ethics form is prepared"" to allow the outside group to pick up his hotel tab, a copy of that form was not provided by the EPA.

Eric Schaeffer, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, said the records obtained by his group reflect Pruitt's priorities.

""These travel records show that Administrator Pruitt is more focused on cultivating his relationships with industry and conservative political organizations in his home state of Oklahoma than he is on protecting the environment and the public health for the rest of America,"" said Schaeffer, who served as the head of EPA's office of civil enforcement from 1997 to 2002."

The suspect, James Matthew Bradley Jr., 60, of Clearwater, Fla., appeared briefly in court Monday morning, hours after officials announced that a 10th victim in the case had died.

Bradley was taken into custody after authorities made a gruesome discovery over the weekend: dozens of suspected migrants crammed into the back of an overcrowded, sweltering 18-wheeler in a San Antonio, Texas, parking lot.

Initially, eight were dead inside the overheated trailer when authorities found them, and more than a dozen others were suffering from life-threatening injuries. The two additional deaths happened at the hospital, authorities said.

The disturbing scene unfolded in the late hours of Saturday night and early hours of Sunday morning when an unidentified tipster, who had been in the truck, approached a Walmart security guard and asked for water, San Antonio Police Chief William McManus told reporters, describing it as a ""horrific tragedy.""

Bradley is charged with one count of transporting undocumented immmigrants ""for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain to wit,"" a federal criminal complaint filed Monday morning says.

According to the complaint, Bradley told San Antonio police officers he was driving from Schaller, Iowa, to Brownsville, Texas, to deliver his trailer to a new owner after his boss sold it and asked him to deliver it.

Bradley said he had no idea what was inside the truck until he took a bathroom break and heard movement inside.

He ""stated when he arrived at the Walmart he exited the vehicle to urinate and he heard banging and shaking in the trailer,"" according to the complaint. ""Bradley said he went to open the doors and was surprised when he was run over by 'Spanish' people and knocked to the ground. Bradley said he then noticed bodies just lying on the floor like meat.""

Aware that the refrigeration system wasn't working, he then went back to the tractor to call his wife, but did not call 911, the complaint says.

About three dozen people were in or around the truck when first responders arrived. Fire Chief Charles Hood told reporters Sunday that those inside were ""very hot to the touch.""

""Our paramedics and firefighters found that each one of them had heart rates over about 130 beats per minute,"" he said. ""You're looking at a lot of heat stroke, a lot of dehydration.""

Brian Pyle, the owner of the Iowa-based company advertised on the side of the truck, Pyle Transportation, told NBC News he had sold the truck in May.

“I had nothing to do with anything that guy did,” Pyle said. “I had no connection, had no idea what he was doing. I feel bad for what happened down there. I’m sorry for everything that happened. I found out about it on the news like everyone else.”

It was not immediately clear where the victims were from, but Mexico's consul general, Rayna Torres, confirmed Sunday that Mexican nationals were among them. The Guatemalan Foreign Ministry said Monday that two of the hospitalized migrants — ages 17 and 23 — were from Guatemala. They are in stable condition. At least one of the deceased was also from that country, the Foreign Ministry said.

The Department of Homeland Security was working with local police in the case. Homeland security agents interviewed one of the undocumented immigrants at the hospital, who told them he came from Aguascalientes, Mexico, and was supposed to pay smugglers $5,500 once he reached San Antonio, according to the complaint.

The migrant detailed a long journey involving crossing the Rio Grande River into the U.S. by raft, walking for a day, getting picked up by a Chevrolet Silverado, and then being thrown into the pitch-black trailer where he was discovered with no water or food.

""During the first hour of transportation, everyone seemed to be ok. Later, people started having trouble breathing and some started to pass out. People began hitting the trailer walls and making noise to get the driver's attention. The driver never stopped,"" the complaint says.

Adan Lalravega, a 27-year-old laborer from Aguascalientes, told the Associated Press that he lost consciousness amid the sounds of whimpering children and pleas for water. When Lalravega awoke he was in a San Antonio hospital bed.

Officials believe up to 200 migrants may have been transported at different times as part of the operation.

""To maximize their criminal profits, these human smugglers crammed more than 100 people into a tractor trailer in the stifling Texas summer heat resulting in ten dead and 29 others hospitalized,"" Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Thomas Homan said in a press release from the U.S. attorney's office for Western Texas.

Bradley's next court appearance is set for Thursday. He has requested a court-appointed attorney.

Obdulia Sánchez, 18, was booked into the Merced County Jail on suspicion of DUI and gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated after Friday's crash, according to the California Highway Patrol.

Sánchez was behind the wheel of a 2003 Buick when the vehicle veered onto the right shoulder of the road, according to the California Highway Patrol. Police said it is unclear how fast Sánchez was driving.

She over-corrected, causing the vehicle to swerve across lanes, crash through a wire fence and overturn into a field, the authorities said.

The two 14-year-olds were not wearing seat belts and were ejected from the car during the crash, officials said.

In a statement, the California Highway Patrol said it is aware of the possibility of ""video evidence located on social media"" and is investigating.

Part of the livestream shows Sánchez outside the car with what appears to be her sister Jacqueline’s body. The other teen can be seen attempting to wave down help.

Sergio Ramos Estrada, a cousin, told NBC News the teens were preparing for a Quinceañera — a special 15th-birthday celebration — when the accident happened.

“We were going to go to her house the next day to celebrate her Quinceañera and unfortunately that happened,” Ramos Estrada said. The CHP is examining the video as part of the investigation.

Sánchez is currently being held on a $300,000 bond at the John Latoracca Correctional Facility in Merced.

Mary Hernandez, 25, was following Sánchez on Instagram and watched as the livestream showed the car careen into the fence.

Disturbed by what she saw, Hernandez said she recorded a copy of the video.

“There are so many people that are on my Snapchat that I see driving on their phone,” Hernandez told NBC News over the phone. “I hope that this video makes people think twice about what they’re doing in their car.”

Hernandez, a medical assistant from Stockton, California, said she doesn’t personally know Sánchez, but the women have mutual friends.

“This is real,” she said. “This is something that could seriously happen to someone.""

In an email to NBC News, an Instagram spokesperson said the platform is working to improve its live video feature.

“We're deeply saddened by this tragedy,"" the statement says. ""We urge people to use our reporting tools if they see any content or behavior that puts anyone's safety at risk. We want to interrupt these streams as quickly as possible when they're reported to us, and we will also notify law enforcement if we see a threat that requires an immediate response. We suggest people contact emergency services if they become aware of a situation where the authorities can help.”

The spokesperson declined to specify how long the video was accessible on the site.

Social media sites such as Instagram and Facebook have faced a host of violent or disturbing postings since users were given the ability to livestream.

In April, Steve Stephens shot and killed grandfather Robert Godwin Sr. while broadcasting the moment on Facebook Live. He had also broadcasted his intent to commit the crime on Facebook moments before. Stephens later killed himself following a police chase.

After questions about the livestreams circulated, Facebook's Vice President of Global Operations, Justin Osofsky wrote in a blogpost that the platform, which owns Instagram, was reviewing its reporting system for videos that violate its standards.

""We disabled the suspect’s account within 23 minutes of receiving the first report about the murder video, and two hours after receiving a report of any kind. But we know we need to do better,"" Osofsky wrote.

A 15-year-old Chicago girl was allegedly gang raped during a Facebook Live broadcast in March, and the stream was watched by at least 40 people, according to police.

In January, four Chicago teens were accused of beating and torturing a bound and gagged man with mental health challenges while streaming on Facebook Live.

After the four suspects had been arrested on unrelated battery charges, investigators were able to connect the two incidents through the Facebook Live video.

Also in January, 14-year-old Naika Venant spent nearly three hours broadcasting herself on Facebook Live in the bathroom of her foster parent’s home before she killed herself."

The discovery started with an experiment dating back to 2014, when Tony Wyss-Coray, a professor of neurology at Stanford, and colleagues found that transfusing blood from young mice into old mice perked up the older mice, boosting both muscle strength and memory.

“It was all mouse to mouse. The first question is do humans have similar factors and do they change with age?” Wyss-Coray asked.

So they tried a new experiment, taking serum — the liquid part of blood — from human umbilical cords, and infusing it into genetically engineered mice that could handle human blood.

The mice learned faster and their brains changed, producing more brain cells, Wyss-Coray and colleagues reported.

“Here we show that human cord plasma treatment revitalizes the hippocampus and improves cognitive function in aged mice,” they wrote in this week’s report in Nature.

But what component of the serum was doing it? They screened the blood for compounds that could be found in high levels in baby blood but that fell as people got older.

“We have now measured well over 1,000 different factors in blood and roughly one third of those change between young people and old people,” Wyss-Coray told NBC News.

They settled first on TIMP2. When infused into mice, it made them learn faster and better but when they dissected the mice, they couldn’t see any brain changes. So they know there must be other compounds in human plasma that affect the brain.

The hope, of course, is to find a cocktail of factors that will rejuvenate the brain without causing cancer or badly affecting other tissues in the body. It's not practical to do large-scale blood transfusions, even if they could be shown to help — which they haven't been.

TIMP2 had not been linked with memory before. “We just saw that it decreases in blood very quickly from age 0 to 20 — a 50 percent drop. It’s possible that in the brain the levels are actually high and they decline much slower,” Wyss-Coray said.

“It’s regulating a lot of different biological processes. Because it has broad effects, we may actually have a more powerful factor.” If a compound could keep the brain and the body young, that would be a slam-dunk for aging science.

The science is in very early stages now. Wyss-Coray says they’ll now study TIMP2 in animals bred to imitate the effects of human brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s.

“We want to understand how these factors work. We want to understand where they come from,” he said.

“We will test this in models of neurodegeneration and understand how it works,” he said. “Commercially, the company is trying to first validating the findings that we have found in the lab and then seeing if this is a treatment we can go forward with.”

They’re also studying broader approaches, including the idea of infusing young blood into old people.

Wyss-Coray’s company has finished a small, safety study of the approach in people and is preparing results for release."

Liz Wagner reports on a story that first aired on July 25. (Published Tuesday, July 25, 2017)

A young Oakland man arrested last year on terrorism-related charges conspired to kill 10,000 people across the Bay Area by blowing up gay clubs in San Francisco, planting backpack bombs on the University of California, Berkeley campus, setting fire to the Berkeley Hills and selling cocaine laced with rat poison, according federal court records obtained by NBC Bay Area.

NBC Bay Area’s Investigative Unit first broke the news that Berkeley High School graduate Amer Sinan Alhaggagi, 22, was indicted late last week for attempting to provide support to the terrorist group ISIS.

During a December detention hearing, federal prosecutors recounted in detail conversations dating back to last July that Alhaggagi had with FBI informants posing as ISIS sympathizers.

“I live close to San Francisco, that’s like the gay capital of the world,” Alhaggagi allegedly told an FBI informant during an online conversation. “I’m going to handle them right. LOL. I’m going to plant a bomb in a gay club. By god, I’m going to tear up the city. The whole Bay Area is going up in flames. My ideas are genius.”

Oakland Man Indicted for Attempting to Help ISIS

An East Bay man has been indicted on terrorism-related charges, federal court records show. Liz Wagner reports in a video that aired on July 22, 2017. Published Monday, July 24, 2017 (Published Monday, July 24, 2017)

But Alhaggagi’s attorney at the time argued his client never actually intended to commit those atrocities.

“The real ultimate issue is how much of these allegations are very stupid and very inappropriate and very disturbing puffery, and how much was intended to be acted out,” Federal defender Hanni Fakhoury said during the hearing.

Prosecutors say Alhaggagi’s actions went beyond “puffery.”

Video Oakland Man Indicted for Attempting to Help ISIS

During the detention hearing, they said Alhaggagi met face-to-face with an undercover FBI agent posing as an ISIS sympathizer, taking him on a tour of the Bay Area and pointing out possible targets for an attack. He also provided three backpacks that could be used to carry bombs to the undercover agent, according to federal prosecutors.

When federal agents served a search warrant at Alhaggagi’s residence, prosecutors say they found a bomb making manual on the desktop of his computer.

At one point, prosecutors say Alhaggagi even asked an undercover agent if he should kill his own friends.

“Do you think I should kill my non-believer friends?” Alhaggagi allegedly said. “That’s like sending an all-out statement that no one is safe. I’ll just call them over and tie them up and execute them.”

According to prosecutors, Alhaggagi planned to flee to Mexico after carrying out those attacks. From there, prosecutors say he planned to join Islamic State fighters abroad.

Despite those disturbing conversations, Fakhoury said his client’s actions tell a different story.

When prosecutors brought up a trip to Saudi Arabia they found concerning, Fakhoury said Alhaggagi was merely attending his sister’s wedding. Prosecutors alleged Alhaggagi told an undercover agent he’d purchased rat poison using stolen credit cards, but Fakhoury said federal agents never found evidence that actually took place. When prosecutors claimed Alhaggagi intended to use stolen credit cards to purchase materials for terror attacks, Fakhoury said the only items his client actually bought with those stolen cards were clothing from an online retailer.

“There’s a disconnect between his words and actions,” Fakhoury said.

During the hearing, federal prosecutors discussed how they were able to track the disturbing online comments to Alhaggagi.

Initially, undercover agents in communication with Alhaggagi were unaware of his true identity or where he lived. However, remarks about wanting to set fire to the Berkeley Hills gave investigators their first clue Alhaggagi lived in the Bay Area. When Alhaggagi allegedly claimed he would join a local police department to steal weapons if he couldn’t make bombs himself, investigators began contacting Bay Area law enforcement agencies. They eventually found an application Alhaggagi submitted to the Oakland Police Department. When an undercover agent met with Alhaggagi for the first time, they confirmed he was their suspect.

But a few months later, prosecutors say Alhaggagi cut off communication with those undercover agents. Agents ultimately arrested him on identity theft and fraud charges relating to the online clothing purchase he made using a stolen credit card. They eventually added the charge of providing support to a foreign terrorist organization.

Alhaggagi’s family said in a written statement given to NBC Bay Area that he loved this country and never intended to carry out a violent attack.

“We were shocked to learn of the accusations involving Amer. Amer is not and has never been radicalized in any way. He grew up in this country and loves it here. He is peaceful and kind. He was very young and immature when he got involved in the online conversations that are the basis for these accusations. He did not think those conversations were serious and he never had any intent to harm anyone. We love him and continue to fully support him.”

Alhaggagi’s arraignment has not yet been scheduled. NBC Bay Area will continue to follow the story and provide updates as more information becomes public."

Trump, who met with Xi in April in Florida, has said he is willing to work with China on trade issues but wants to see Beijing use its economic leverage to force North Korea to scale back its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, which are a threat to the United States, South Korea and Japan.

But Trump has become frustrated that China hasn't done more to pressure Pyongyang, and he has been considering moving ahead on trade actions.

Schecter', 'Hannah Rappleye']","PALM BEACH COUNTY, Florida — For the first responders who found her lifeless body one October morning, 24-year-old Alison Flory was yet another casualty of addiction here on the front line of Florida's opioid crisis.

To her family, she was a daughter, a beloved sister, a goofy bookworm who made them laugh and a young woman they desperately hoped would get help. She had arrived in South Florida from Illinois just more than a year before she died, seeking treatment for her addiction. Her parents believe it is that treatment, paid for by her family's excellent insurance, that ultimately got her killed.

Thousands of addicts arrive here each year from Ohio and West Virginia, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, hoping that at one of South Florida's many drug treatment centers, they'll find recovery. And some do.

But an investigation by NBC News has found that many of these vulnerable patients have become grist in an insurance fraud mill. Crooked treatment centers partner with ""body brokers"" and operators of so-called ""sober homes"" to find patients with good health insurance. Brokers and sober home owners offer those trying to get clean free rent and grocery store gift cards, cigarettes and manicures in exchange for going to a specific treatment center, which pays kickbacks for every client.

Once they've reeled patients in, these treatment centers bill their insurance tens of thousands of dollars for often questionable counseling, costly and potentially unnecessary drug screens, and exotic laboratory tests. Some treatment centers not only overlook drug use — they encourage it. To Florida's worst operators, relapse doesn't mean failure. It means profit.

""This is an entire industry that's been corrupted by easy money,"" said Palm Beach County's top prosecutor, State Attorney Dave Aronberg. ""Unscrupulous actors have taken advantage of well-intended federal law, and a lack of any good law at the state level, to profit off people at the lowest stages of their lives.""

That law is the Affordable Care Act, which along with the federal Mental Health Parity Act passed in 2008, was meant to ensure people suffering from addiction could get the care they needed. Together they required insurers to cover substance abuse treatment, barred companies from rejecting those with preexisting conditions, and allowed young people to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26. But this broader coverage met with little oversight.

Those looking to make cash found the country's opioid epidemic had provided them with a trove of desperate people, many young and hooked on pills or heroin, and access to a deep pool of insurance dollars. Everyone got in on the business. Substance abuse treatment in Palm Beach County used to consist largely of a scrappy network of treatment centers and sober homes that just scraped by. In the past few years it's become a $1 billion business, according to the Palm Beach Post's calculations.

""It's a total scam,"" said Aronberg. ""Not only are taxpayers footing the bill, but people are dying unnecessarily because of this.""

The scammers have made it difficult for the ethical, and sorely needed, treatment centers and sober homes to survive, said John Lehman, the director of the Florida Association of Recovery Residences, an industry group that oversees sober homes.

""The broad brush of bad actions and illegal activity is painting across everybody,"" said Lehman. ""So the good guys are having trouble keeping their beds full. And the bad guys are saying you want to shoot dope in the bathroom, go ahead.""

Three Moms Send Their Daughters to Florida

Alison Flory was a teenager who loved to be in love. She loved trips to the bookstore in Sugar Grove, a Chicago suburb, Star Wars, ice cream, and when she was 17, she fell for a boy. He was artsy, and moody, and loved her back, so much that when she said she wanted to break up, he threatened to kill himself. Her mother thought it was teenage stuff. ""I said, 'That's ridiculous,'"" Jennifer Flory said.

He called Alison one night after they split. She didn't answer. On the voicemail, she could hear as he jumped in front of a train. Alison was beside him at the hospital when he died.

""She felt like it was her fault,"" said Flory. ""I felt like it was my fault. We all felt like it was our fault.""

Alison started with prescription pills to dull the pain. Her parents read the signs — moodiness, languishing in bed — as grief. And they were. But she was also sinking into substance abuse. Flory's smart, ambitious daughter made it less than a year through college, dropped out, and sank deeper. She did a month of rehab in Illinois, and Flory thought she'd get her smiling daughter back. But when Alison got out, her parents said a boy Alison met in rehab introduced her to heroin. Jennifer didn't know exactly what was wrong with her daughter. In 2015, when Alison was 23, Flory knew she needed help.

That was the same year that Michelle Curran decided that rehab was going to be the difference between life and death for her daughter, Mikaya Feucht. Mikaya first used pills after a surgery while she was still in high school outside of Columbus, Ohio, a state that routinely leads the nation in deadly overdoses. By the time Feucht was 23, she had two little boys she loved fiercely, but the pull of heroin threatened to tear them apart.

Across the state in Troy, Sandra Hinkle was at work as a 911 dispatcher the day in April 2015 when the call came in that her 22-year-old daughter Kaitlyn Cruea had overdosed on heroin. Cruea had a little boy, too. Hinkle wanted Cruea to live to see her son Karter grow up. To get her well, Hinkle felt she had to get her daughter out of town.

These mothers discovered that Florida was happy to help. They found the state's flourishing recovery industry through an internet search, word of mouth, and the help of an Illinois man working as a marketer for a Florida treatment center. Their daughters each started at a different treatment center, but the pattern is the same.

Someone checked their insurance, asked a few questions, bought their daughters a plane ticket to South Florida — a potentially illegal marketing practice. The mothers were told their insurance would cover the care and that everything was going to be okay.

“ I felt like it was my fault. We all felt like it was our fault.”

""I felt hopeful, more than I had ever felt,"" said Jennifer Flory. ""I didn't know. I thought going to this treatment program was going somewhere special.""

Within a few months, each mother began to suspect something was wrong. Their daughters would call every few weeks to tell them they had moved to a new sober home. And when they did, the names of the treatment centers on the bills that kept arriving changed too.

Envelopes from their insurance company arrived almost daily, detailing thousands of dollars in treatment and thousands more in laboratory tests. There were bills from chiropractors and bills from counselors and bills for DNA testing.

Dizzied, the mothers tried to track from afar where their daughters were and who was helping them get sober. Sometimes, when they called, a counselor on the other end of the line would offer updates, or explain charges. Others never even picked up.

As their girls hopped from house to house, the envelopes from the insurance companies mounted. But the mothers didn't realize the scope of the problem, because no one ever came to collect. Treatment centers routinely, and illegally, waive co-pays and deductibles, according to prosecutors, telling patients and parents insurance covers everything.

Treatment centers and labs rack up sky-high bills, sometimes collecting only a fraction of the money charged for a $5,000 urine test or a $1,800 counseling session. What they don't get paid, they write off, said Aronberg. Flory, Curran and Hinkle said they never got calls from debt collectors, so it took time to realize what was unfolding.

Curran's insurance would be charged more than $600,000 by the seven treatment centers Mikaya attended between January and June of 2016. Flory's was charged about $1.2 million during the 15 months Alison bounced between nine different facilities in South Florida. At least three of the facilities the girls attended have been raided by law enforcement and shuttered. All of the facilities declined requests for comment by NBC News.

Hinkle hasn't tallied up everything yet, but she keeps coming back to that one month when she said she got billed for more than 172 different charges.

""How did I not see this? I should have known,"" said Hinkle. ""You just want to believe they're in the right place, that they're getting the help that you sent them for.""

How the Florida Model Was Born

In 2015, the year these mothers first sought help, nearly 52,500 people lost their lives to an overdose in the U.S, up nearly 40 percent from 2010. About 33,000 of those deaths were due to opioids, more than any year on record. Overdoses now kill more people than car accidents, more than guns.

Treatment is not always within reach. Waitlists for beds at state-run facilities across the country can run weeks or months. Many private rehabs don't take insurance, and their fees can run $10,000 or more a month.

For these problems, the Sunshine State had an answer.

The ""Florida model"" was born with good intentions. In a traditional, 28-day inpatient program, patients are cloistered, then return to the community.

Alison Flory overdosed and died at this sober home in 2016 NBC News

In many South Florida programs, clients first attend inpatient detox, then do more intensive rehab and outpatient treatment while living in the community. The idea was that this would better develop their ability to live on their own. It also kept costs lower, so some insurance companies would cover treatment longer.

""Sober homes"" became key to this model. Patients would pay rent to live in the group homes, sleeping and eating there, then report to nearby drug treatment centers staffed with counselors and doctors. At their best, these homes provide structure, rules and a community to lean on in the early stages of recovery. But unscrupulous operators began to realize these homes could be a way to reel in vulnerable addicts.

Some sober homes offered addicts free or discounted rent, cash, and other perks in exchange for attending a specific treatment center, which law enforcement officials said violates Florida laws barring kickbacks and insurance fraud. Those in the shuffle are more blunt.

""It's like hustling humans,"" said Drew, a 21-year-old from West Virginia who was living in a sober home in Delray Beach last February. ""They'll take extra insurance money and pay you to live there and just let you get high because the owner's making bank.""

Delray Beach Mayor Cary Glickstein estimates that his city of 66,000 has about 700 sober homes that house up to 7,000 people in recovery. Nearby Lake Worth, Boynton Beach and West Palm Beach likely hold hundreds more. Exactly how many is hard to know, because sober homes operate without any kind of oversight — and the bad homes, he said, are crowding out the good.

""These kids are just cycled through different houses,"" said Glickstein. ""There's no supervision. Many times they're supervised by convicted felons, people that are trafficking drugs while they're supposed to be supervising kids in recovery.""

This is an unintended consequence of federal disability and housing laws that bar municipalities from discriminating against those with physical or mental disabilities, including addiction. Cities that have tried to limit sober homes have been successfully sued for discrimination. But because the treatment isn't technically being provided within the homes, they can't regulate them as they would drug treatment centers either.

Within these homes, people are dying. Palm Beach County's overdose deaths have quadrupled in the past four years, hitting almost 600 in 2016, as the number of treatment centers and sober homes has grown. The rise of the synthetic opioid fentanyl is exacerbating the problem, making batches of heroin stronger, and more deadly.

""It's a tragedy on so many levels,"" said Glickstein. ""The desperate parents in Ohio and Kentucky and Michigan that are being lured through deceptive websites with palm trees have no idea what their kids are getting into when they get down here.""

MIkaya Feucht and her children. Michelle Curran

Palm Beach County has started to crack down. Last year it launched a task force, headed up by State Attorney Aronberg, which has made 30 arrests for so-called ""patient brokering"" since last July.

In May, Gov. Rick Scott officially declared Florida's opioid crisis a state of emergency. Legislators recently passed a bill that would increase penalties for brokering. It will give prosecutors sharper tools to crack down on what a grand jury last December found was rampant brokering and fraud across the industry.

""The legitimate players, the good guys, are far outweighed by the corrupt,"" said Aronberg. ""This is not a case where a few bad apples spoil the whole bunch. This is a case where most of the apples are spoiled.""

Among those to see gold in addiction was a man who became one of South Florida's most notorious treatment center owners. All three of the girls from the Midwest, Alison, Mikaya and Kaitlyn, would get wrapped up in his network. His name was Kenneth Chatman.

'He Sees A Dollar Sign'

Rehab was not the first way Chatman tried to make a buck in Florida. In 2008, Chatman, a transplant from New York, pleaded guilty to federal charges for running a credit card fraud scheme. After that, he founded a car dealership that didn't go far. Then he had a gym, where, according to an account he posted online, he got interested in the journey to recovery.

In 2012, while he was still on federal probation, he became what's known in South Florida as a ""body broker."" He rented houses in the area and began to operate them as sober homes under the name Stay'n Alive. He stepped into a game already hot throughout South Florida. He partnered with local drug treatment centers, offering to send them his residents in exchange for kickbacks.

More than 100 pages of police reports obtained by NBC News through an open records request show that his homes were chaotic from their earliest days. One address was visited by the police 15 times in a year.

Sometimes Chatman called the cops to deal with an unruly resident. Sometimes the residents called to complain about Chatman — for kicking them out, refusing to give them back a phone, or in one woman's case, trying to block her from leaving.

There were also rumors of Chatman trafficking his female clients. In 2013, a woman reported that her god-daughter was living in one of Chatman's houses. She told police he had called her to demand money, and that she had heard Chatman was prostituting women under his care.

In 2017, he would plead guilty to a multi-million dollar conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud, and to sex trafficking, for prostituting his female clients.

But at the time, those rumors didn't hinder him. In fact, Chatman worked his way up from brokering patients out of his sober homes to running the drug treatment centers themselves.

In Florida, nearly anyone can open a treatment center, as long as they have a little cash, find a doctor to write prescriptions, and a clinical director to oversee treatment. The exceptions are those, like Chatman, with felony convictions. To dodge that, his wife, Laura, became the official owner. Reflections Treatment Center launched in late 2013.

The empire rose quickly. One arm of it oversaw the sober homes, some of which Chatman continued to run himself. He also recruited a network of other homes to funnel bodies to his treatment center. He has since admitted to giving $500-a-week kickbacks to sober home operators who brought him insured clients. All told, court papers show Chatman paid out at least $640,000 to three sober home operators who sent people his way.

In exchange for free rent, addicts boarded vans — ""druggie buggies"" as locals call them — three to six mornings a week, bound for Reflections. Chatman, fit and nattily dressed, put up a good front. He posted videos of success stories, and made a brand of t-shirts his clients wore that read DOPELESS HOPE FIEND.

But behind the blackened windows of the treatment center in a Margate, Florida strip mall, former clients and employees said treatment wasn't the priority.

""I walked right into the group room and I could easily spot that at least 90 percent were getting high,"" said Jack, who attended Reflections in 2015. He said Chatman made it clear clients could use as long as he could bill their insurance. ""When he looks at a client, he doesn't see a human being,"" said Jack. ""He sees a dollar sign.""

But the real dollars didn't come from sitting kids down for treatment. It was in getting them to pee in a cup.

A $10,600 Bill for a Drug Test

In the spring of 2016, the incessant bills Michelle Curran received in the mail began to make her wonder. She called her insurance company, Cigna, but she said no one ever called her back. (Cigna said it could not comment directly on Curran's case for privacy reasons, but said it has since contacted Curran and is addressing fraud issues in Florida).

One day on the phone with her daughter Mikaya Feucht, Curran started to try to get to the bottom of things.

Mikaya Feucht died of an overdose after six months in at least seven rehabs in South Florida, including Reflections, a facility whose owner has pleaded guilty to health care fraud and sex trafficking. Her mother, Michelle Curran, provided NBC News with a copy of a bill showing the total charges submitted to Mikaya's insurer, Cigna.

""I'm like, 'I didn't know you saw your therapist every single day,'"" Curran remembered. Feucht said she most certainly did not. ""So I said, 'Are they doing drug tests every day too? I have a bill here for $10,600."" And she goes, 'Mom, I've' — and these were her words — 'I've peed in a cup twice this week.'""

Random drug screens have long been a key piece of recovery. Treatment centers and sober homes used to depend on dipstick tests, the kind anyone can do, which can run as low as $5 apiece. If staffers got what they thought was a false result, they'd send it over to a lab for ""confirmatory"" tests to make sure the results were right.

Chatman was among a group of treatment center operators who realized laboratories could become the financial fuel of the rehab industry.

They made deals with labs, or started up their own, so they could take a slice of every test billed. Particularly lucrative were young people from out of state like Feucht, Flory and Cruea, because their insurance could be charged at sky-high out-of-network rates. One tally by an industry group found 75 percent of the young people in treatment in Florida are from out of state.

Doctors at treatment centers would put in ""standing orders"" for near-daily drug screens, along with genetic and allergy tests that could run thousands of dollars.

Mikaya Feucht's mother, Michelle Curran NBC News

To maximize profits, some treatment centers retest samples or double-test patients. When Chatman didn't have enough clients in treatment to hit his lab numbers, he had employees submit their own saliva and urine to keep the money flowing, according to court documents.

Chatman teamed up with at least five different labs, according to the federal indictment filed against him in 2016. Kickbacks were so common that he allegedly complained to one laboratory rep when he wasn't offered money or wined and dined.

One unnamed lab wrote Chatman at least $160,000 in kickback checks between December 2014 and May 2015, court papers show. Another allegedly had a driver go to the Florida Keys to cash checks and deliver thousands of dollars to Chatman each week.

“ I've peed in a cup twice this week.”

Chatman went to great lengths to keep a hold on people. Former clients and court documents describe how he nailed the windows of houses shut, and locked them in from the outside. He confiscated and never returned their cell phones. He took their money and then plied them with drugs so they would relapse, trigging another round of insurance-funded treatment.

Curran said that in May 2016, she learned a man named Kenny had allegedly provided her daughter drugs so she would relapse. When Feucht overdosed, he allegedly left her on a sober home lawn for the first responders to find.

When some parents called Reflections to ask about stories they were hearing from their kids, Chatman convinced the parents their kids were lying, according to one former employee, because that's what addicts do. But his most effective tool may have been that he always provided a home of last resort.

""Even though he mistreated a lot of them, he had this hold over them,"" said a woman who worked at Reflections in 2014. ""A lot of people had been cut off by their parents. He always took you back in.""

Former employees said they tried to raise flags. Three said they asked the state's Department of Children and Families, which regulates treatment centers, to do a surprise inspection. In an email sent to DCF in February 2015 and provided to NBC News, one person who had worked there told the agency that despite the fact that Chatman's wife Laura was on the paperwork, Chatman was actually in charge. The email also said patient applications had been forged, and that there were rumors Chatman was prostituting his clients.

DCF told NBC News that the agency did not have authority to screen personnel or spouses not listed in certain leadership roles on licensure applications. The agency did not respond specifically to NBC News' questions about warnings employees said they submitted about Chatman.

Two months later, in April 2015, a woman contacted the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. She told police that Chatman ran flophouses, using one as a ""staging home for women who are addicts,"" according to her account in a police report obtained by NBC News. She charged that he kept her and other women ""in a state of impairment in order to pimp them out,"" placing ads for them on a local escort site.

Local police turned the investigation over to the FBI. Police reports show the agency already had an active investigation going on Chatman.

But that didn't hinder Chatman from growing his business. In September 2015, DCF gave Reflections a permanent license to run both intensive rehab and outpatient treatment. A year later, Laura Chatman applied to open a second treatment center, Journey to Recovery. The application, obtained by NBC News, shows that while the center was opened under Laura's name, Kenny Chatman is listed as a signatory to its bank account. It was approved.

The same month, he and Laura bought a $1.1 million home in Reflections' name. Chatman posed for photos at charity events, where he gave away large checks to support kids' football games and unwed mothers.

Chatman relied on this image as a pillar of the community in December, when the Palm Beach Post published a scathing expose, which included details from the report of the woman who said she had been prostituted. Chatman denied everything, telling the paper in a statement, ""I would never, knowingly put any of the clients of Reflections Treatment Center or any other vulnerable young person in harm's way.""

In the wake of Chatman's arrest, DCF said it has accepted the surrender of both licenses for his treatment centers. The agency said it refers complaints that are beyond its authority to law enforcement, and coordinates with those groups to hold individuals accountable. It has also supported recent legislation to beef up standards for substance abuse in the state.

""The alleged practices of those who have been accused of taking advantage of vulnerable individuals are shameful and sickening and DCF has no tolerance for this type of behavior,"" the agency said in a statement.

Chatman's attorney Saam Zanganeh said that his client was a small fish in an industry where fraud and kickbacks run rampant. ""Everybody's looking for a scapegoat,"" Zanganeh said in May, when a judge sentenced Chatman to spend the next 27 years in federal prison. Zanganeh said his client had fully cooperated with federal authorities, and criticized the judge for overruling the ""miraculous"" plea deal of 14 years Zanganeh had negotiated.

Laura Chatman pleaded guilty to two felony counts for letting her husband use her name on the paperwork for the treatment centers they opened. Her attorney, Christopher Lyons of the Miami-based firm Mase Tinelli, said that she had been kept in the dark about her husband's business. ""She is sincerely remorseful for her role in the offense and causing so much pain to the victims and their families,"" he said.

Two sober home operators, a mental health counselor and a doctor have also pleaded to fraud charges. A third doctor has pleaded not guilty, and is taking his case to trial.

The First To Die

Katie Cruea was the first of the three Midwestern girls to move into Chatman's houses, and she was the first to die.

She'd been living in sober homes linked to Chatman for about two months when her mother, Sandra Hinkle, bought her a ticket to come back to Ohio for the holidays. She arrived at noon on Christmas Day 2015, and left a few days before New Year's. At the airport, Cruea begged Hinkle not to make her go back. Hinkle thought her daughter was just getting cold feet, doing that addict thing.

""She said, 'Mom please don't make me go, I'm afraid I'm never going to see you again,'"" Hinkle remembered. ""I gave her a hug, and said 'You will absolutely see me again, I'll never let anything happen to you. I'm your mom.'""

But Hinkle never did see her daughter again. Cruea overdosed on February 24, 2016. She was found in a local motel, dead of an overdose of cocaine mixed with the synthetic opioid carfentanil. ""It was almost like she was giving me a warning, like she knew,"" Hinkle said.

Five months later, Mikaya Feucht, who had been shuffling through the same network of Chatman-linked houses since March, got kicked out of her sober home after her boyfriend got in a fight with the manager. In the middle of the night, Feucht, her boyfriend and bags holding all of their belongings were dumped at a motel in Boynton Beach.

Curran was in touch with Feucht that night and most of the following two days, trying to figure out a plan to get her daughter stabilized. Then the phone went quiet. At 3:07 on the morning of July 31, two sheriff's officers knocked at the door of Curran's house in Ohio, where Feucht's two boys slept tight.

Curran sat on the couch, tired and confused. It wasn't until an officer knelt on the floor next to her that it clicked. Curran said he told her, ""'We had a detective from Florida get ahold of us.' And I knew. I said, 'What happened to my daughter?' They told me she was found in that hotel.""

“ I'll never let anything happen to you. I'm your mom.”

Local police have responded to 17 overdoses at that motel since 2010, at least five of them deadly. For many addicts caught in the South Florida shuffle, motels are the last stop.

Alison Flory was still living in her sober home the day she died. Things seemed to be going well. Alison would call back to Illinois to talk to her younger siblings for long stretches, chatting about movies or counseling her brother on how to navigate the bullies at school. ""She was their idol, just the fact that she was in Florida was breaking their heart,"" Flory said. ""She was really feeling a bond with family, she was trying to make things right.""

October 13, the last day of Alison's life, was like many before it. She got up, she went to treatment at Reflections, she sat in group therapy, she peed in a cup. Then she went back to her sober home, a yellow bungalow where she and her boyfriend were living with at least three other couples. Shamar Brooks, the 24-year-old ""manager"" who rented and operated the home, lived in the green house next door.

The 911 call came from Brooks at 8:35 the next morning. When he entered the house to wake everyone up to go to Reflections, he told responders, he found Alison wasn't breathing. He couldn't feel a pulse. She was declared dead at 9:09 a.m.

Flory said she never got a call from Brooks, or from Chatman at Reflections. ""No condolences,"" said Flory. ""There was nothing."" It was a roommate of Alison's who called to tell Flory her daughter had died. Brooks told NBC News he considered Alison a friend, and declined further comment.

On May 17, Hinkle, Curran and Flory traveled to Florida for Chatman's sentencing. Each took a turn, along with nine other people, standing before a federal judge in Palm Beach County to tell him what Chatman and the South Florida shuffle had done to their families.

""He had such influence — why didn't he use that influence to help people?"" Flory told the judge as Chatman sat, shackled at the waist and nearly motionless at the table behind her.

Like the other mothers, Flory wanted justice. But above all, she wanted Alison's death to bring change, to save someone else's life.

""There's no sentence that will bring my daughter back,"" Flory added. ""She didn't deserve to die."""

Lynda Obst, who produced ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""Interstellar,"" was the second so-called secret witness asked to testify at pre-trial hearings in Los Angeles. She called him a ""scary person.""

""I was afraid of the defendant,"" she testified. ""He kills witnesses.""

Obst, who appeared in ""The Jinx,"" the HBO series about Durst, was a close friend of Susan Berman, a writer who was murdered in 2000 — allegedly because she knew too much about the millionaire's involvement in the 1982 disappearance of his first wife, Kathie.

Under oath, Obst recalled a conversation she'd had with Berman about Kathie's disappearance. Berman said that at Durst's request she had posed as Kathie and called in sick to Albert Einstein Medical Center, where the missing woman was studying medicine.

The detail is key because the prosecution contends that at the time of the call to Albert Einstein, Kathie was already dead. Convincing a jury that someone else made the call bolsters the district attorney's timeline of the events around her disappearance.

Under cross-examination, Obst, 67, was questioned about why she didn't tell anyone about the call at the time of Kathie's disappearance, after Berman's slaying, or even during her interview for ""The Jinx.""

""It would have been marvelous if I had remembered it,"" she said of her appearance on the HBO show, which examined Durst's links to Kathie's disappearance, Berman's murder and the dismemberment of an elderly neighbor in Texas.

""I did the interview cold.""

It wasn't until she watched ""The Jinx"" and saw a reference to the mysterious call to Albert Einstein that she realized, with ""heart racing,"" that she had potentially important information. She called the director, Andrew Jarecki, who told her to call the district attorney, which she did after much hesitation.

""I was reluctant to get involved,"" she said.

She said that even though Durst is frail and behind bars, she worried about her safety.

""He has means, even from prison,"" she said.

And, she said, she had long suspected that he was behind the death of Berman.

""I suspected Mr. Durst,"" she said. ""I just know that I did.""

Durst, who is serving seven years on a federal gun charge, has pleaded not guilty to murdering Berman; he is not charged in connection with Kathie, who is presumed dead.

The judge has not yet decided if the jury will be allowed to hear testimony from Obst and other pre-trial witnesses who were brought to the stand so their testimony could be recorded in case they are not available during the trial."

A former high school chemistry teacher convicted of cooking meth in New Mexico — not unlike Walter White, the fictional antihero from ""Breaking Bad"" — was sentenced to four years in prison Wednesday, prosecutors said.

New Mexico District Judge Fernando Macias handed the defendant, John W. Gose, a nine-year sentence, all but four years of it suspended. After he is released, Gose must serve five years of supervised probation.

Gose, 56, pleaded guilty in May to trafficking by manufacturing a controlled substance.

He was arrested in October after Las Cruces police officers found a white Styrofoam ice chest containing glassware, rubber tubing and chemicals used to cook methamphetamine during a routine traffic stop, according to prosecutors.

When we woke up the following morning we found out we were going to have a baby.

America is the greatest country on Earth, and has provided me as well as my family with so much. While I am a Democrat, when I found out that I was going to be a father to a beautiful baby girl, I put partisanship aside. Like so many other Americans, I want our country to succeed.

As a parent, providing for my family has become priority number one. That means worrying about my daughter’s well-being, finding a home with a great school district, what neighborhoods are the most family friendly and how to teach my daughter to take pride in her American and Hispanic heritage.

But today it seems like politics has invaded everything, making the mundane aspects of parenthood political. I worry about many things, but lately it's been about the future of my daughter's health.

Having a child is a miracle fraught with the realities of human fragility. There are so many things that can go wrong between the time a child is conceived until it is born.

As a father, I am looking for Congress to help ease my fears, not add to them. On this very basic metric, our president and Congress are failing.

No parent wants to be in the position of putting their family’s financial stability in peril to pay for their child’s health care. Yet, The “Better Care Reconciliation Act” (BCRA) and its latest iteration would deprive upwards of 20 million people of the essential health care they need and will gut protections for millions of people with pre-existing conditions. This could increase the cost of care for my family and put undue strain on our pocketbooks.

RELATED: Latinos Are Growing Share of Uninsured: Health Coverage Report

For those who already have health insurance, and don’t have a pre-existing condition, consider the following: being a mom could become a ‘preexisting condition.’ Before the Affordable Care Act (ACA), pregnancy was considered a pre-existing condition, and insurers frequently denied coverage because of it. Carrying a baby carries some risk, so insurance companies see pregnant women as more of an expensive group of customers when they apply for coverage.

But thanks to Obamacare, they can no longer do that. Yet under the Republican bill, insurers may be able to charge higher prices due to a person's recent medical history.

Don’t families deserve better?

One thing a new parent should not have to worry about is whether they are going to have health insurance or go bankrupt paying to keep their child healthy. Under the ACA, 4.2 million Latinos gained insurance coverage and the Latino uninsured rate fell to a record low of 16.2 percent.

Due to the expansion of Medicaid through the ACA, the number of uninsured children dropped significantly. In 2000, around 26 percent of Latino children were uninsured. In 2013, right before major coverage provisions of the ACA took effect, two million Latino children, or 11.5 percent, were uninsured. In 2015, after implementation of the the ACA, that number dropped further to 1.4 million, or 7.5 percent.

This dramatic decline in the number of uninsured Latino children represents the largest drop over a two-year period in our nation’s history.

The Senate bill or BCRA would significantly hurt the progress made in keeping our families healthy. It would erode funding for Medicaid, which is essential in providing health care coverage for 74 million people, including 18 million Latinos.

RELATED: One-In-Seven U.S. Babies Born in 2015 Were Multiethnic or Multiracial

Repealing the ACA without a replacement would be wildly irresponsible and it's increasingly unlikely that the GOP will come to agreement on a legislative path forward. Republicans must turn to governance and hold hearings in Congress to fix what's wrong with the ACA and make it better. And it's got to be bipartisan. They have to work with Democrats.

And I may be a Latino Democrat, but more and more Americans agree with me. A new poll found that an overwhelming 8 in 10 Americans want Republicans to work with Democrats to fix health care, not strip it from people.

It seems I'm not alone in wanting congressional leaders to make it easier — not harder — for people to save money for their children’s future.

As a parent I am responsible for my child's well being. So all I'm asking is that Congress help families, not add to their financial worries.

Being a parent is an amazing blessing fraught with many challenges. The President and Republicans in Congress should be thinking about how they can make our lives easier not harder.

White'],"Americans might be a little fuzzy on exactly what the Federal Reserve is and why the central bank’s activities matter, but many do believe it’s not working as well as it should.

“When we’re talking about the Fed, not everyone knows exactly what it does,” said Jill Gonzales, an analyst at WalletHub.

As it turns out, that’s an understatement. A recent WalletHub survey found that 16 percent of Americans think the Federal Reserve is in charge of consumer credit scores (it isn’t), and more than half have no idea when the Fed last raised interest rates (last month). Many have no idea who Fed chair Janet Yellen is.

Policy experts warn that this combination of an information gap and a suspicion of the institution could ultimately hurt American wallets and bank accounts.

“The public has almost never really understood what the Fed is or what it does,"" said Peter Conti-Brown, an assistant professor at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ""What's different today is that there is a combination of confusion and strong opinions: People don't quite know what the Fed does, but public trust in the Fed is at a historic low. It's that combination that is dangerous.”

Roughly one in seven Americans thinks the Federal Reserve ought to be abolished, according to WalletHub’s survey, a sentiment Gonzales suggested could be related to current White House sentiment. Donald Trump was critical of the Fed and Fed chair Janet Yellen on the campaign trail.

Related: Trump Says Yellen Should Be Ashamed of Herself

“That and the larger amount of people saying it needs work… under a different administration, those numbers might look different,” Gonzales said.

Who Will Replace Yellen?

The Fed is scheduled to meet today and Wednesday, and recent reports suggest that Trump might replace Yellen, whose term ends next February, with National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive who is not an economist.

“Gary Cohn's appointment could matter a lot for the average American, depending on what happens next. Cohn is famous for being a very effective banker, but not knowing much about monetary policy,” Conti-Brown said. “The Fed Chair must read thousands of pages of economic analysis and routinely gives speeches that are themselves quite technical and long.”

Although much of the Fed’s work on monetary policy is dense or arcane, people do understand, by and large, that the Fed plays a role in interest rates, and that how much they pay to borrow money and service debts is affected by the central bank’s work.

“Interest rate moves have a pocketbook effect although the ability to directly connect the dots, that’s where the dropoff occurs,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com. “People can connect the dots… it’s the specifics where I think people are a little fuzzy.”

An April survey conducted by Bankrate.com found that, although 38 percent of Americans said the current political environment in Washington was the biggest economic threat the nation faced, one in 10 said the biggest threat was rising interest rates.

“I think that one speaks to the pocketbook effect. That was up from 5 percent in September of last year,” McBride said.

“When there’s an organization like the Fed that’s essentially in charge of raising your credit card rate or your savings rate, I think that’s what people pay attention to… even if they don’t necessarily understand it,” Gonzales said.

Half of Americans Don't Like Rate Hikes

WalletHub found that three in 10 Americans think rate hikes are good for the economy, while 36 percent say they are bad and the remaining 34 percent don’t know, while 56 percent think rate hikes are bad for their wallet. “I think it’s interesting that the split between good for the economy and your own wallet is so different,” Gonzales said.

Although most people have a sense that the economy overall has recovered, many don’t feel they have benefited from the resurgence. “Americans still feel left behind. They’re still practically living paycheck to paycheck [and] underemployment is still a problem in many American cities,” Gonzales said.

However, targeting Yellen for replacement could be a risky move, McBride said. The Fed has indicated it wants to continue raising interest rates at a slow and measured pace, as well as winding down a Great Recession-era expansion of its balance sheet. A misstep in either area, due to a lack of experience or to curry political favor, could do real harm to the economy and possibly tip the recovery into a recession.

Related: Five Things to Know About the Latest Rate Hike

“With the Fed getting ready to start winding down the balance sheet and the Fed already having raised interest rates four times, it’d be like changing pilots on final approach,” McBride said. “This is a critical juncture… a change in the head of the Fed that with both of those at play increases the risk of a misstep.”

And the appointment of Cohn to Yellen’s position could compromise the central bank’s adherence to policy over politics. “Cohn will be seen as President Trump's loyalist,” Conti-Brown warned.

The specter of a less-independent Fed increases the risk that the pace of a balance sheet wind-down and interest rate increases would be subject to political pressure, which could throw the American economy into a recession, Conti-Brown said.

“That is the risk that comes with prizing political loyalty over expertise in these appointments,” he said."

But it seems many people are having fun twiddling their thumbs in the free version of the game, instead of forking over $9.99 for the upgrade.

While the app ranked No. 1 for free downloads in 75 countries, it was No. 1 in revenue in only 23 countries. In Nintendo's home country of Japan, the app struggled to stay in the top five, according to Sensor Tower, an app intelligence firm.

Mobile gaming is big business, generating an estimated $37 billion this year globally, according to market research firm Newzoo. However, at $9.99, Super Mario Run is one of the more expensive offerings in the app store.

That's where scammers — we'll think of them as the evil Bowser in this situation — come in, luring players with the promise of a free leap over the pay wall.

There are more than 341 malicious accounts promising free access to Super Mario Run, according to a report released Thursday by ZeroFOX, a threat intelligence firm.

""No one wants to pay for anything ever if they can get away with it,"" Evan Blair, co-founder and chief business officer at ZeroFOX, told NBC News. ""And, any time there is a pop culture phenomenon, you will find scammers jumping all over it.""

One of the most popular ways is through social media. Scammers have created accounts that appear legitimate and boast thousands of followers.

They'll claim to offer a free download or free coins, which are the game's currency. People are then urged to click a questionable link that redirects them to phishing pages, where they'll be prompted to enter personal information, Blair said.

Another scam involves hijacking popular Super Mario Run hashtags to push another scam, such as the promise of watching the new ""Star Wars"" movie for free.

""There are a lot of legitimate deal sites out there and social media isn’t one of them. If you’re going to look for offers on social, make sure you’re engaged with the official brand accounts,"" Blair said. ""It sounds simplistic but if it seems too good to be true, it probably is."""

During a news conference on board the papal plane, Francis said he would look for common ground at Wednesday's meeting — the first between Trump and the leader of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics.

""First of all, I never judge someone before I listen to the person. I can't do that,"" the pontiff said. ""We will talk and things will come up … I will tell him what I think, he will tell me what he thinks, but I never wanted to judge someone before I listen to the person first.""

Francis also said he and Trump would find ""doors that are not completely shut"" to create conversation, but he declined to say if he thought the meeting could be used to soften Trump's stance on certain issues.

While the pontiff has not directly criticized Trump, he has spoken out about some of his more controversial campaign promises, particularly his pledge to build a wall and ""make Mexico pay for it.""

In February, Francis urged his congregation to ""not raise walls but bridges, to not respond to evil with evil.""

""A Christian can never say, 'I’ll make you pay for that.' Never,"" the pope said at the time. ""That is not a Christian gesture. An offense is overcome with forgiveness, by living in peace with everyone.""

Trump later responded to Francis' remarks in a Facebook post, warning that ""if and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS ... I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been President because this would not have happened.""

He added that others are ""using the Pope as a pawn and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so, especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant.""

“Even though it's important to be flexible and accommodating with venture capitalists during discussions, know your limits and don't cross them. I could share many anecdotes, but perhaps the worst one was when I once had to endure an hour-long pitch to a very well-known healthcare VC at a top-tier firm who was on his phone doing email the entire time. What made it even more awkward was that he was the only person in the room other than me and my CFO. I kept pausing and asking, ""Should I keep going?"" and he would look up from his phone and say, yes, yes, and then get back to answering his emails.

I left feeling so deflated from that meeting. When I recounted the story to a friend, who is a serial entrepreneur, he told me I should have cut the pitch short and made a polite but swift exit. Why would I want someone like that on my board? And he was right. It was tremendously empowering to have this ""aha"" moment where I took myself out of the ""victim role.""

All of my interactions with prospective outside investors since have been much more efficient and less demoralizing. I should mention as an aside that the investors that we do have on our board are amazingly supportive and respectful, which certainly helps me have the confidence to keep the bar high now and not tolerate disrespectful VC behavior.”

One of the biggest benefits of a group is that you get an “instant board of directors” (and you are a part of that board for others in the group.) This means you have a team to go to in order to share and tackle business issues with in a confidential setting.

I’ve received tremendous value from this, which has helped me avoid some very costly mistakes. You can do this in a formal way, as I have done with EO, or you can get a group of fellow business owners together and do it more informally. Do not underestimate the power of being able to talk to others who are going through similar situations.”

“My best piece of entrepreneurial advice is to view failure as a gift. When the business is in pain, it will force you into submission, and if you listen, it will give back to you. For the first two years I was a solo founder, and the business completely broke me. I had two babies under the age of two, a strained marriage, and I was trying to do it all. The business had taken off, but then it stopped. I thought I was growing the Blueprint for soups, but the wholesale market wanted nothing to do with me.

Instead of crying (although there were LOTS of tears) I put one foot in front of the other and opened myself up to the idea of inviting another leader into my realm. Sathish, who is now our CMO and my business partner, with co-founder status, joined in July 2015, and we worked HARD to make a significant pivot in Splendid Spoon: moving the business from a primarily wholesale model to direct to consumer. Within a month of re-launching SplendidSpoon.com our business had quadrupled.”

Nicole Centeno left her career in sales to start Splendid Spoon after five years of research on diet and fasting. It is now one of the fastest growing companies in the food space and has been featured widely by the New York Times, Business Insider and others.

""Be your genuine self. It sounds very cliché, but it implies a level of authenticity that staff, customers, and clients all recognize and support. Don't copy other business models simply because they are successful, but follow what you are truly passionate about and what feels authentic to you. I have been a teacher since I was seven years old. With a classroom of teddy bear pupils, I would teach addition and subtraction, music, and baking, using my fancy Easy-Bake Oven. Another favorite student, my life size Barbie doll head, became the perfect canvas for fine-tuning my makeup application skills for my cosmetology class.

During my college career, I pursued a degree in music, avoiding my true passions — education and makeup. After many unhappy years of teaching music, I then started Makeup Geek. My business is built by creating quality makeup, and educating customers on how to use it. If I solely created makeup products, there would be nothing authentic about the brand. However, bringing in the education element helps me to stand out from the competition. I want makeup lovers to know how to apply our high quality products to test out their skills with my help.

If I had stuck with what I ""should"" have been doing (music) and not following what was true to my authentic self, then Makeup Geek would not be here today.""

27,http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-s-health-care-bill-remains-shrouded-secrecy-n772456,nbcnews,The Senate’s Health Care Bill Remains Shrouded in Secrecy,"['Benjy Sarlin', 'Leigh Ann Caldwell']","WASHINGTON — The Senate is closing in on a health care bill that could affect coverage for tens of millions of Americans and overhaul an industry that makes up one-sixth of the economy.

Only one problem: Almost no one knows what’s in it.

""I think it's being written, uh, by someone somewhere but I'm not aware of who or where,"" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, deadpanned to NBC News. ""If you get a copy of it, will you send me a copy?""

In a striking break from how Congress normally crafts legislation, including Obamacare, the Senate is conducting its negotiations behind closed doors. The process began five weeks ago, after the House passed its version of health care reform, with a small working group of 13 senators rather than the broader committees who usually handle the issue.

The opaque process makes it impossible to evaluate whether there are any significant changes coming to health care. There are no hearings with health experts, industry leaders, and patient advocacy groups to weigh in where the public can watch their testimony or where Democrats can offer amendments.

“We'll let you see the bill when we finally release it,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) told reporters on Tuesday. He added that “nobody is hiding the ball here” and that people were “free to ask anybody anything.”

Free to ask, but answers are another matter. Republican senators are still negotiating over specific pieces of a bill, but they say they’re close enough to producing legislation that they could hold a vote within weeks. They have been tight-lipped on the details, leaving Americans with only a trickle of leaked ideas that are often vague or speculative.

Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said in a hearing on Thursday that his staff had provided ""technical assistance"" to senators working on the bill, but that he had not seen any ""legislative language"" himself.

Democrats have complained about being shut out, but even some Republican senators have said they’ve had difficulty getting information about the legislation and wished there were more public opportunities to register concerns.

""Would I have preferred a more open process? The answer is yes,” Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) told reporters on Monday evening.

Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said that he’s complained to leadership about the lack of transparency. “I would have liked to have seen a public process — get buy-in from the public,” he said. “I’ve said that in several of our meetings but that’s obviously not what’s going to happen. Now when the bill’s complete, the public then will have a chance to view it.”

Related: Trump Called House Health Care Bill 'Mean' in Senate Meeting

Asked if they had seen any legislative text, a Republican aide to a member of the 13-person Senate working group deadpanned: “Why would they show us any legislation?""

The approach is broadly similar to the process that produced the American Health Care Act in the House last month. At the time, leaders released a finished bill and voted on it within 24 hours — so fast that the Congressional Budget Office couldn’t estimate its cost and effects for another three weeks. The move was a jarring shift after years of promises from House GOP leaders to slow down major legislation and post all bills online several days before a vote.

Democrats are increasingly drawing attention to the lack of transparency, which they’ve criticized as an effort to rush through legislation before Americans can scrutinize its effects or individual lawmakers can push for changes.

“Will we have a hearing on the health care proposal?” Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) pressed Finance Chairing Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) in a separate hearing last week. Hatch would not commit to one, but invited McCaskill to pass on her ideas. “We have no idea what’s being proposed,” McCaskill responded.

On Tuesday, several Democratic members linked the closed process to a change in the Senate’s media policy that blocked reporters from filming in the hallways.

“Why are they doing that?” Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said at a weekly press conference. “It's obvious. They don't want the American people to see how poorly they would do under this bill.”

It was not clear there was a connection, however: After blowback, Republicans expressed surprise at the shift and Rules Committee Chairman Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said no new restrictions had been approved.

During the crafting of the Affordable Care Act, Republicans complained about a lack of transparency on the bill that reformed the health care system. Then-House Speaker John Boehner gave a fiery floor speech, saying just before the House vote on Obamacare, “Read the damn bill before you vote.”

But Senate Democrats spent months in 2009 negotiating different versions of a health bill through multiple committees in the House and Senate. The committees then spent days on markups in which members could offer amendments and the full Senate held an open debate on the final version for 25 days. After the House passed the Senate bill in March, they made a series of tweaks using the budget reconciliation process, which Republicans are using exclusively to pass their own bill.

“What’s going on here is backwards,” John McDonough, a professor of public health at Harvard who was a Democratic Senate aide during the ACA debate, told NBC News. “The attempt to keep it in the dark is to make sure that as few Americans as possible know what’s in it and what the implications of it are,” he added.

Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), a member of the Senate leadership team, defended the process on Tuesday, saying Democrats would have an opportunity to offer amendments once the bill was put on the floor. Pressed on the lack of committee hearings or input by a reporter, he described the Senate GOP working group as “a committee of the whole.”

Critics see the gambit as a response to the House bill’s poor reception after the CBO estimated it would leave 23 million fewer people insured, while raising premiums and deductibles for many low-income and older Americans. A Kaiser Health tracking poll in May found 55 percent of respondents have an unfavorable view of the House bill versus 31 percent who view it favorably, and most polls have found a similarly negative reaction.

Asked whether Republicans were operating from the assumption any bill they passed would be unpopular, Barrasso suggested he wasn’t concerned about pleasing their loudest critics.

“There is nothing that I think that the Senate can pass that is going to satisfy the left activists in California [whose] state senators have just voted for a single payer plan,” he said.

There are some factors that could slow down the Senate. In comparison to the House, the Senate is barred from voting on a bill before a cost and impact estimate is released from the nonpartisan CBO.

But if the Senate is to really vote before they leave town for a week on June 30th, a goal that many Republicans hope is still achievable, that leaves little time for the public to see legislation. A CBO score takes 10 to 14 days to produce. There are only 17 days left before the end of the month."

Perry actually was talking with comedians known in Russia for targeting celebrities and politicians with audacious stunts, Energy Department spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes said in a written statement.

Pranksters Vladimir Krasnov and Alexei Stolyarov are sometimes called the ""Jerky Boys of Russia,"" after an American duo who put out recordings of their prank phone calls in the 1990s. They have made faux calls to British singer Elton John, who thought he was speaking to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and others.

""These individuals are known for pranking high-level officials and celebrities, particularly those who are supportive of an agenda that is not in line with their governments. In this case, the energy security of Ukraine,"" Hynes said.

During the 22-minute call on July 19, Perry, whose department oversees the U.S. nuclear weapons program, discussed a range of topics in a business-like tone, including sanctions against Russia and helping Ukraine develop oil and gas.

Perry said the Trump administration opposes Nord Stream 2, a Russian project to bring natural gas to Europe across the Baltic and that U.S. technology could help Ukraine develop gas.

""Giving Ukraine more options with some of our technology is, I think, in everyone's best interest with the exception of the Russians, but that's OK,"" he said.

Perry also discussed the Paris climate accord and coal exports on the call.

The call, first reported by E&E news, was recorded and posted online.

It happened about a month after Perry met with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and his delegation at the Energy Department.

President Donald Trump said last month that Washington plans to offer Ukraine more coal exports from the United States because the eastern European nation's industrial sector has difficulty securing coal from separatist-held regions.

It is unclear how the United States would bring more coal to Ukraine but Perry hinted on the call that the Commerce Department was working on it.

""The coal conversation at this particular point in time is with (Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross) and I full well suspect it will go forward,"" he said on the call.

News of the call came the same day the U.S. House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to impose new sanctions on Russia."
29,http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/u-s-slaps-sanctions-venezuelans-stop-constitution-rewrite-n786796,nbcnews,U.S. Slaps Sanctions on Venezuelans to Stop Constitution Rewrite,['Suzanne Gamboa'],"WASHINGTON — The U.S. has sanctioned 13 Venezuelan officials hoping to pressure President Nicolas Maduro to drop plans for a July 30 election that could lead to a rewrite of the Latin American country’s constitution.

The sanctions announced Wednesday were against current and former government officials and business leaders that the U.S. identified as being involved in staging for Maduro the election of new members of a national constituent assembly. The assembly would be given orders to make changes to the constitution and potentially allow Maduro to expand his power.

Maduro has said he wants the changes to restore peace and order to Venezuela. But opponents held a non-binding referendum against the plan. Some 7 million Venezuelans in the country and around the globe turned out to reject Maduro's plan.

The Treasury action freezes the assets in the U.S. of the Venezuelan officials and prohibits anyone in the U.S. from dealing with them.

“Our sanctions demonstrate the United States is standing by the Venezuelan people in their quest to restore their country to a full and prosperous democracy,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. “Anyone elected to the National Constituent Assembly should know that their role in undermining democratic processes and institutions in Venezuela could expose them to potential U.S. sanctions.”

Other Venezuelan officials have been sanctioned by the U.S., including Venezuela Vice President Tareck El Aissami, whose assets were frozen under the Kingpin Act.

Opponents of Maduro have been staging months of protests and held two national worker and business strikes to prevent the constituent assembly vote from going forward. Numerous people have died and hundreds have been injured or jailed in some of the protests.

Anger at the government has grown as food and basic necessities have become scarce and inflation has soared, although Maduro, the handpicked successor of Hugo Chavez, still has support in the country.

“The Venezuelan opposition estimates up to 15,000 civilians have been wounded in recent protests, with over 3,000 arrested and 431 political prisoners in detention,” the Treasury office said. “Arbitrary arrests are rampant, as is physical abuse against detainees; alleged instances of torture and other violations and abuses are perpetrated by the Bolivarian National Guard, the Bolivarian National Police and other security forces.”

Venezuela has been defiant in the face of other threats from the U.S., dismissing Trump's promise last week to take “strong and swift” economic sanctions. He also declared Maduro a “a bad leader who dreams of becoming a dictator.”

Those sanctioned are: Tibisay Lucena Ramirez, president of the Maduro-controlled National Electoral Council and president of his board of elections; Elias José Jaua Milano, head of the Presidential Commission for the National Constituent Assembly and also minister of education and former executive vice president of Venezuela; Tarek William Saab Halabi, Venezuela’s ombudsman, whose job is to defend human rights in the country and Maria Iris Varela Rangel, member of the Presidential Commission for the National Assembly.

Also sanctioned are the country’s minister of Interior, Justice and Peace and leaders and former leaders of Venezuela's security forces.

The Treasury Department said Venezuelan government corruption is “associated heavily” with its state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela and the official exchange rate regime set by the National Center for Foreign Commerce. Officials from those entities also were sanctioned.

Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., said in a statement she welcomed the sanctions particularly against the military and security officials. She said only with such sanctions “can we send a clear message that we will not tolerate abuse happening in Venezuela.”

Related: Venezuela Crisis Enters Pivotal Week

Members of Congress of Cuban descent, like Ros-Lehtinen, have been some of the loudest voices against Venezuela. Several have made comparisons of the Maduro government to Cuba under the Fidel and Raul Castro regime.

Democrat Sen. Bob Menendez, from New Jersey and also Cuban-American, said the targeted sanctions were necessary. But he called on other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to bolster the U.S. action with their own.

""The world is watching and our hemisphere must not stand by as Venezuela burns and millions clamor for help,"" Menendez said."

But with all the gadgets on the market, which one deserves a spot on your nightstand or under your pillow?

ResMed S+ Sleep Sensor - $129.99

If you want to track your sleep, but don't like the idea of wearable device like a Fitbit, then the ResMed S+ is a great option. Once you aim the tall rectangular device towards yourself, it tracks breathing and body movements to analyze how well you're sleeping.

With its companion app, it then offers a ""sleep score,"" graph showing when it thinks you were in deep, light, and REM sleep.

The tracking technology is based on ten years of research by the ResMed team, and, after our testing, it seems to have mostly paid off. It did a good job figuring out when we were in bed, and the sleep analysis seemed to reflect how rejuvenating (or not) sleep felt.

ResMed

The app tries to offer feedback, too, though some of it is common sense - like taking a bath to relax before sleep and getting more exercise. The device is reliant on the app and Bluetooth connectivity to your phone, and in our testing, it became unpaired after a few nights. It was easy to pair it again, but having to troubleshoot Bluetooth before bed isn't exactly relaxing.

It also monitors the conditions in your bedroom - like temperature, light, and noise level - in case those factors could be keeping you from your ideal sleep.

The company notes that ResMed technology will soon be integrated in a new sleep tracker from SleepScore Labs, so keep an eye out for that later this summer if you can wait.

BEDDI Glow Smart Alarm Clock with Wake Up Light - $79.99

Also vyiing for space on your nightstand, BEDDI Glow from WITTI is an alarm clock that can wake you up naturally with a simulated sunrise. The light is customizable in any color you could possibly want, and can gradually increase its glow for up to 30 minutes before your alarm time.

You can download their companion app and pair your BEDDI Glow alarm with music from your smartphone, the radio, or services like Apple Music and Spotify.

It's an attractive bedside companion with thoughtful additions like traffic and weather updates at the press of a button - though just with a computerized voice that's reliant on your smartphone.

As smart alarm clocks go, BEDDI Glow is a good choice for a much gentler and more customizable wake-up than the blaring of an alarm from a smartphone.

Smart Nora Snoring Solution - $299

If you or the person who shares your bed is a snorer, think of the Smart Nora as the improved, high-tech version of prodding them to get them to switch positions.

The device has two parts: an electronic sensor that looks like a white computer mouse that sits on your nightstand, aimed in your direction, and an inflating pillow insert attached to a fabric case. When the sensor ""hears"" snoring, the sleeve under the pillow inflates. The idea is that the movement of the pillow will stimulate the relaxed throat muscles that cause the snoring and then allow for natural breathing to resume.

In testing, the Smart Nora did seem to decrease the frequency and volume in our house's snorer - making for a more restful night for everyone. We found the device's 30 minute delay option particularly useful, because if not engaged, Smart Nora would interpret pillow talk as snoring and start the inflating and deflating. And a rising and falling pillow is not exactly a mood setter before bedtime. Plus, while Smart Nora is described as ""silent,"" we could amost always hear a gentle inflating noise (when we were awake).

Aesthetically speaking, some might be bothered by the plastic tube that extends from beneath the pillow since it does give the Smart Nora the look of a medical device (which it is not). You can hide the device's boxy kit under the bed, but there's no easy way to disguise the tube.

This pillow has built-in speakers, a sleep tracker, and it's comfortable, thanks to being filled with memory foam. Rem-Fit

Zeeq Smart Pillow from Rem-Fit - $299

This pillow is really trying to do it all, which is probably at least part of the reason why it costs so much (for a pillow). One of its most attractive features of the Zeeq Smart Pillow is its ability to play sound that's audible only to the person whose head is resting on the pillow, not his or her bed companion. This could be great for a couple where one partner likes to fall asleep to music or an audio book, but the other needs silence. In testing, it delivers on this ability for music or for an alarm.

Despite the fact that the pillow has multiple speakers, a gyroscope, a battery and a microphone inside it, it's comfortable thanks to being filled with (purple!) pieces of memory foam.

Zeeq also promises to stop snoring with its embedded microphone and two vibrating motors that buzz when snoring is detected. We found the inflation of the Smart Nora more gentle than the buzz of the pillow, but this inevitably varies by the individual.

Like the S+ sleep tracker from ResMed, Zeeq also has a companion app and is marketed as a sleep tracker. But, the tracker relies on motion detection by the pillow, unless you spend more on a sleep monitoring strap that collects heart rate and respiratory rate information.

With any device promising to give detailed information about how well you are sleeping, most sleep experts say not to hang your hat on the sleep scores they offer.

""If one's using it hoping to find, 'Oh, I'm getting this much deep sleep versus REM sleep,' there they're not quite as accurate,"" said Dr. Shelly Zak of the Sleep Disorders Center at the University of California at San Francisco. ""Use them as sort of a general guide, but not as a specific measure,"" she advised.

Athlete Recovery Sleepwear from Under Armour - $60/garment and up

Under Armour is getting in on the sleep game, too, by printing what they call bioceramics on the inside of the fabric of their garments. According to the company, this fabric can absorb body heat and reflect it back as far-infrared energy.

The company points to studies from the National Institute of Health that show positive impacts of far-infrared energy on recovery - things like helping your body restore muscles while you rest.

In testing, the pajamas were very comfortable, but it's hard to really put a finger on whether we felt particularly restored (or any different at all) when we woke up.

According to Dr. Zak, further study would be needed to really prove that pajamas can actually improve sleep quality. ""It's intriguing,"" said Zak. ""But they would need larger studies and more controlled studies to really make an assessment of whether or not it's efficacious,"" she said.

Of course, there are plenty of free options for improving your sleep — no gizmos required.

Doctors say basic changes like minimizing noises from your sleep environment (especially those you might not think of, like an air conditioner clicking on in the middle of the night and waking you up) can make a huge difference. And, try to stick to a regular sleep schedule and spend a minimum of an hour relaxing or ""winding down"" before bed."

The CHC has stated its members will oppose a batch of spending bills, deemed necessary to support national security, if the bills include money for the border wall with Mexico.

House GOP members have said they plan border wall funding in the spending bills and intend to prohibit debate or a vote on the wall money apart from the bills that pay for military, veterans affairs, legislative and energy and water development programs and projects.

BOLD PAC, the caucus' political action committee, is running the ads. The ads urge viewers to stop congressional Republicans from ""sneaking in funding for Trump's border wall.""

The ads are targeted at Republican Reps. Martha McSally of Arizona; Jeff Denham, Ed Royce, Steve Knight and David Valadao of California and Will Hurd and John Culberson of Texas. Each ad is tailored to the specific lawmaker.

Hurd, whose vast Texas congressional district hugs the U.S.-Mexican border, sponsored an amendment to the batch of spending bills requiring that Department of Homeland Security provide a comprehensive border security strategy to Congress before any money is used for the border wall or other barriers.

The amendment, first reported by The Hill, requires DHS provide more detail on technology it wants to use, costs per mile of border for their use and more specifics on where they would be used, among other things.

Despite the amendment, BOLD PAC had no plans to drop its ad targeting Hurd. A spokesman for the PAC said it wants to keep the pressure up for the money to be dropped from the bills.

According to NBC Philadelphia, Kratz was arrested by Philadelphia police late on Thursday at his home in the city.

The murders occurred over a few days in early July. All four men — identified as Jimi Taro Patrick, 19, Dean Finocchiaro, 19; Thomas Meo, 21; and Mark Sturgis, 22 — met with DiNardo and Kratz to purchase large quantities of marijuana, according to the Bucks County District Attorney's office, though it remains unclear if drugs were the motive behind the killings.

""I don't know [why DiNardo and Kratz killed them],"" Bucks County District Attorney Matthew Weintraub told reporters on Friday. ""We may never know.""

At DiNardo and Kratz's arraignment later in the day, both men entered a plea of not guilty.

Bucks County District Court Judge Maggie Snow scheduled the men's preliminary hearings on July 31 and set no bail. She also ordered that they not be placed in the same prison out of concern for their safety.

DiNardo admitted to the four murders on Thursday and told authorities where to find the bodies, according to his attorney Paul Lang.

The body of one of the men was found at the bottom of a 12½-foot-deep grave on a farm in Bucks County owned by DiNardo's parents. The three other victims were found in a metal tank that was buried on the farm, according to the affidavit.

DiNardo told police that he agreed to sell Patrick four pounds of marijuana for $8,000 and brought him to the farm on July 5, according to the probable cause affidavit. Patrick only had $800, so DiNardo offered to sell him a shotgun instead. He then took Patrick to a remote part of the property, shot him with a .22 and buried him with a backhoe, according to the affidavit.

Two days later, DiNardo offered to sell a quarter-pound of marijuana to Finocchiaro for approximately $700, the affidavit said. On the way, DiNardo picked up Kratz and allegedly gave him a .357 handgun. They allegedly agreed to rob Finocchiaro.

While at the farm, Kratz shot Finocchiaro in the head, according to DiNardo's statement to police. DiNardo then took the gun and allegedly shot Finocchiaro while he was on the ground. They used a backhoe to place the body in a metal tank that DiNardo referred to as a ""pig roaster,"" the affidavit said.

On the same day, the affidavit said, DiNardo met with Meo and Sturgis not far from the farm and brought them back to the property under the guise of a marijuana deal. Kratz waited for them, as he and DiNardo agreed to rob the pair.

When they returned to the farm, DiNardo allegedly shot Meo in the back and shot Sturgis as he tried to run away with the .357 handgun.

He then allegedly ran over Meo, who was still alive, with the backhoe before lifting both men's bodies in a metal tank. He poured gasoline inside and lit them on fire.

He buried the tank the next day with Kratz's help.

Kratz's statement to police on Thursday was similar to DiNardo's, though he claimed he did not shoot anyone.

DiNardo was originally arrested on Monday for an unrelated gun charge. He is not allowed to own a gun because of his history of mental illness.

The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that his lawyers claim he is schizophrenic."

A Texas family has created a best-selling line of healthy tortillas and tortilla chips sold in national chains like Whole Foods, and it all started with a conversation between siblings.

Veronica Garza, co-founder and president of the Austin-based Siete Family Foods, was home for the summer after completing her Master's in Business Administration. In a conversation with her brother Roberto about several auto-immune conditions she has had since high school, he suggested that a grain and gluten-free diet could help alleviate the symptoms she’d been struggling with since her diagnosis. She decided to follow his advice.

“I started doing that, and when I did my whole family just jumped on board with me,” said Veronica.

But it meant giving up the flour tortillas that were a staple of her family’s Mexican-American diet, so she created a recipe using almond flour to fill that void. It may have stayed in the family if her youngest brother Miguel, just out of law school, hadn’t intervened.

“Miguel kind of convinced me and my mom that we should turn this into a business,” Veronica said.

Miguel also convinced the buyer of the Austin’s Wheatsville Food Co-Op to meet with them.

“I packed a little ziplock with maybe 10 tortillas, no packaging, no company name,” said Veronica. “We just had a product.”

Miguel insisted the buyer try the tortillas in front of them. The buyer liked what he tasted and was ready to place an order. The Garzas weren’t ready to produce them just yet, but they found a commercial kitchen soon after, officially launching Siete Family Foods in 2014.

“We would hand press the tortillas for hours, until 3 in the morning sometimes, every weekend, then that became every day,"" recalled Veronica about how her parents and her siblings got the products started. ""I had to quit my job because I didn’t have time for it anymore,” said Veronica.

Their efforts paid off; their products are now nationally distributed in over 500 stores, including Whole Foods, and six of the seven members of the Garza family work for the business full time.

“We want to become the grain-free, Mexican-American food brand for this generation,” said Miguel. “We want to be a household name and we want to do that because we can have more impact.”

Co-founders of Siete Family Foods, Veronica and Miguel Garza. Courtesy of Veronica Garza

The Garzas reflect a diverse Mexican lineage and roots in Texas going back six generations. Their maternal grandfather, Antonio Campos, was a civil rights advocate and had a law degree. He helped develop the ""The Schools of the 400”, a program for non-English speaking children that would become a model for Head Start, among other initiatives.

We spoke to Veronica and Miguel about how they got started, the family dynamic that keep them going, and the mission propels them forward.

Why was it so important to re-incorporate tortillas into your diet?

Veronica: We lived in Laredo, a border town in Texas, right across the bridge from Mexico. Tortillas are a staple in our diet and always have been when were growing up. We just felt like we were missing out not being able to eat any, missing out on some of our culture.

Was there a point when you decided that this was an idea you could develop and market?

Veronica: I thought that there was business potential here, but I had no idea what to do, so there was a lot of fear of how to go about that. When I brought my family into the picture, as far as launching a business, it kind of all came together because I had that support that I needed.

Miguel: Maybe I was opportunistic but I kind of just weaseled my way into it as the baby of the family does. Like my sister, I thought the product and idea was something that would be life changing for a lot of people, and I convinced her that I could have a positive impact of the future success of the business. The verdict is still out, but I’m trying.

We all know the challenges of working with family. What’s the upside?

Veronica: We had a gym together before we launched this business. So we enjoy being around each other, we enjoy working with each other. Everybody has a different set of skills they contribute to the business. And we know each other so you don’t have to walk on eggshells. It works out for us.

You describe Siete Family Foods as a mission-based company. What is that mission and how would you like to see it grow?

Miguel: Our tortillas and chips are in the marketplace and if people want to eat them, that’s fantastic. But we have this goal of educating people on what food is, what food does to the body, and how it can shape you’re health and wellness. Education is a massive undertaking because, as an entire society, we’ve lost some of the intimacy with our food, where we don’t know what is actually going in our body. At a macro level, we have this idea that we can bring people back to the table, that we want to create products that are inclusive.

We [also] have parents and grandparents before us that have forged a path to create opportunities for us. I want to do the same thing for this generation and the next. Whatever we’re doing is to lift people up. On the business side, I have that as a goal for myself, to create more opportunity.

Veronica: That’s definitely a family mission too, something ingrained in us. Especially with my grandfather who was very involved with Mexican-American civil rights. I studied Mexican-American studies in college, that was my degree, and initially I thought I would go to law school and follow the path that my father, sister, and eventually my brother took. To have something to do with public policy to effect a positive change for Latinos. I didn’t end up doing that.

So I do feel that having this business can do that. Especially, if we can have a company that I could be a mentor to someone, a Latina that is trying to do something similar, that would be great. I would feel like I’ve done something positive for my community. It’s not a mission for our business but something personal."

Ladish'],"Josefina Monasterio, 71, is glad she didn't think about her age when she took up bodybuilding at age 59.

""I would have missed out on the past 12 years of fun and success,” said the former educator, competitive athlete and author, who recently returned from the NPC Southern States Championships in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

“I took second place this year, and I´m not used to that. I'm used to winning!” said Monasterio, whose enthusiasm is contagious. Dr. Josefina, as she likes to be called, was inducted in the NPC Southern States Hall of Fame in 2005 and then for three years in a row starting in 2014.

“Coming in second this year just encourages me to improve and get better. I must fight the belief system that implies that as you age you get worse,”she said.

The Vero Beach, Florida resident recently published a book, Vibrant at Any Age, based on her lifelong journey of self-improvement. She hopes to inspire people to achieve their goals just as she has.

“I reinvent myself every ten years, and so I started my 60s as a bodybuilder and now I begin my 70s as a writer,” she said. “I don´t impose limitations on myself. People limit themselves by age, nationality, gender, it's very frustrating. Age is a mindset.”

Dr. Josefina started bodybuilding at an age when most are contemplating retirement, though she was an athlete from an early age. As a child in Venezuela she took to gymnastics and later graduated with a physical education degree.

She later obtained a Master's in Education and later a Ph.D. in Adult Personal Development. She taught at Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for 16 years, while raising two daughters.

“I started bodybuilding when I met Steve Pfiester, a gym guy who knew I ran and practiced yoga. He invited me to his gym and offered to train me. I started in January and by June he took me to my first competition in Bradenton, Florida,” she said.

Dr. Josefina´s photos are proof that she dedicates long hours to taking care of her body. But she also nurtures her mind and spirit. On any given day, she gets up at 3 a.m. to read the Bible, meditate and pray. At 4.30 a.m. she´s out the door to walk three miles and run another three. This is followed by yoga and and a swim at the beach while the sun rises.

“The aging process can be slowed down by taking care of mind, body and spirit,” she said.

While this sounds like a workout already, it does not stop there. After writing in her journal and working on her next book between 8 and 10 a.m, the vibrant Venezuelan American hits the gym for at least two hours, where she trains different muscle groups depending on the day of the week.

“My workout is sacred, non-negotiable. I keep a very tight schedule so I don´t lose track of time,” she says.

Her afternoons are devoted to relaxing, goal-setting, cleaning, reading and grocery shopping.

“I keep my life simple. I don´t drink or smoke, I don´t stress, I eat a balanced diet and by 8 p.m. lights are out.”

Dr. Josefina´s war on ageism has rubbed off on her two daughters, both in their early thirties. “They both take care of their bodies and minds. They´re very proud of me now and brag about me. If you give them a good foundation as a parent, know that they will always come back to their roots. I tried to remind myself of that during the difficult teen years.”

Dr. Josefina Monasterio flexes her muscles as a 70 year old bodybuilder. Courtesy of: Dr. Josefina Monasterio

To prove how strongly she feels about fighting ageism she confessed she never accepts the senior discount whenever it’s offered at stores.

“If I concede, then it means I believe in that system. It´s like being a traitor! I pay my full amount, and continue to live the way I want to, regardless of my age,” she says.

Dr. Josefina has hosted several shows, the latest being Empowerment with Dr. Josefina, a local television show in Indian River County, Florida. She also has a YouTube channel where she shares her journey of fitness and empowerment.

She says she would love to see more Latinas breaking age stereotypes. “I can´t do this alone,” she said. “I would love more people to take ownership of their body, mind and spirit. If you exercise and take care of yourself you can look and feel better than someone twice as young. My bone density and muscle mass are better now than a few years ago. And it´s because I work at it.”

When people tell her they want to look like her when they reach her age, she has a simple comeback: “Why not do it now? You need to be disciplined, like me. Some mornings I don´t want to get up. But then I think of the consequences that would have in the long run and that gets me right out of bed.”

Dr. Josefina is already preparing for her next bodybuilding competition and wondering what her next reinvention will be like.

“One of the things I´ve been thinking to myself lately is that we should never give up on ourselves. I certainly don´t. Give yourself the opportunity to fail. Don´t let fear be stronger than the excitement of being yourself and winning!”

Eisenstein'],"After Volkswagen was caught cheating on diesel emissions, consumers have become more skeptical about diesel vehicles. Now, manufacturers across the globe are forced to rethink their plans for the high-mileage technology.

Facing accusations that it also duped emissions tests, Daimler AG this week announced the recall of 3 million diesel vehicles sold in Europe. Industry analysts believe the automaker could follow up with a similar move in the U.S. where it is under investigation by the Environmental Protection Agency.

Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz brand previously announced it wouldn’t sell any diesel models in the United States during the 2017 model-year, and it has not said whether it will return with any of its so-called “oil burners” in future years.

Daimler is just the latest manufacturer to face allegations it rigged its diesel engines to illegally pass emissions tests. Volkswagen AG has so far spent about $30 billion on legal fees, fines and a massive buyback after admitting it rigged two of its engines with what the EPA called a “defeat device.” The U.S. government is currently suing Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in a similar case.

Still other automakers are finding themselves under a cloud of diesel smoke. And that is raising the prospect that what had looked like a strong comeback for high-mileage diesel technology just a few years ago may be turning into a bust.

Porsche CEO Oliver Blume told Reuters this week, “We are looking at the issue” and may stop offering diesels entirely in the next few years, though he added, “We have not made a decision” yet.

A Shift from Diesel to Electric

The Volkswagen brand, which once counted on diesels for one-quarter of its U.S. sales, won’t bring the technology over any more and is looking to scale back diesel technology globally, shifting focus to electrified powertrain technologies: hybrids, plug-in hybrids and pure battery-electric vehicles.

The maker has been forced to buy back or repair over 500,000 TDI models, and got permission from the EPA to sell off some leftover 2016 offerings that have been updated to meet tough American emissions standards. They’ve been going quickly, in part due to sizable incentives. But no new diesel models will follow.

Whether Daimler will bring diesels back to the U.S. has not yet been decided, said Rob Moran, chief spokesman for Mercedes-Benz USA. “We constantly review our portfolio offerings,” he told NBC News, adding that even if the company is cleared by regulators, “with the increased effort to certify diesel engines in the U.S., we have put the certification process for diesel passenger cars on hold.”

In the early part of the decade, diesel technology looked ready to stage its first significant comeback since the 1980s. Manufacturers, especially Europeans, started rolling out a new generation of “oil-burners” that shed all the problems of the diesels that Americans came to hate in the 1980s. Those older models were slow, noisy and smelly. The new engines, the industry said, were quick, clean — and even more fuel-efficient than before.

Or so it seemed.

A Multi-Billion-Dollar Problem

In September 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency accused Volkswagen of using a “defeat device” to reduce emissions of smog-causing oxides of nitrogen when the vehicles were being tested. In real-world use, however, they would produce up to 40 times the allowable limit.

VW soon acknowledged that subterfuge, which put sales of vehicles using both its 2.0- and 3.0-liter diesels on hold. It has since spent nearly $30 billion in fines and settlements and on a plan to buy back almost all of the vehicles using those rigged engines. It has, however, received permission to fix some later-model vehicles, including the 2015 VWs it is now trying to sell off.

The scandal cast a smoky pall over the entire industry, regulators going back to see if other makers had played similar games. In January, the EPA charged Fiat Chrysler Automobiles with rigging some of its own diesel models, a charge CEO Sergio Marchionne has vociferously rejected. But, for now, the agency has refused to certify diesel versions of the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ram 1500 pickups, meaning they can’t be sold in the U.S.

“I think a lot of industry marketing types are worrying about getting a black eye if another glitch shows up,” analyst Joe Phillippi of AutoTrends Consulting told NBC News. And, ultimately, “the question becomes whether you can justify the cost if the volumes aren’t there,"" he said.

There are some manufacturers still committed to diesel, notably General Motors, which has options available on its Chevrolet Cruze passenger car line, as well as the midsize Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon pickups.

Mazda, after struggling to come up with a formula that would deliver good mileage and performance — and meet emissions rules — is finally set to launch the SkyActiv-D engine in its CX-5 crossover, and it has suggested that if that diesel reaches a 10 percent share it will look at other models to use it in.

Diesels have long remained an engine of choice for medium- and heavy-duty truck buyers. And Ford recently announced plans to add a diesel option for its light duty full-size F-150.

Diesel demand “took a hit after the Volkswagen crisis,” said Steve Hansen, of the trade group, the Diesel Technology Forum, but “there has been an upturn in recent months, along with some significant announcements from automakers.”

But the numbers aren’t quite so upbeat. U.S. diesel sales are down 35 percent year-over-year, according to HybridCars.com. (Though the website does not track all heavy-duty models, observers say it captures the general trend of recent times.)

A Global Decline in Diesel

What’s worrisome to manufacturers committed to diesel is that the U.S. trend isn’t entirely unique. Backed by government subsidies, diesel demand has been declining in Europe. There, a growing number of environmentalists and regulators have begun echoing the skepticism of their American counterparts. Paris, for example, is looking to ban diesels entirely.

Related: These Countries Want to Ban Diesel and Gas Vehicles

Where diesels currently account for about 50 percent of European sales, that is projected to drop to as little as 30 percent by 2020, and the UBS Group forecasts the global share held by diesels will drop from 13.5 percent today to just 4 percent by 2025.

There are some questionable assumptions baked into such forecasts, notably the expectation that after a very slow start electrified vehicles will suddenly gain traction in the marketplace. Last year, all forms of battery-based models, from light hybrids to pure EVs, however, captured barely 3 percent of the American market, and it remains to be seen if U.S. buyers will be more interested in the lower-priced, longer-range models just now coming to showrooms.

But automakers are shifting resources. Long one of the biggest diesel proponents, VW now plans to have 30 pure electric models in its portfolio by 2025 and is even launching a battery sub-brand, VW I.D.

Should such vehicles fail to catch on, automakers may have to rethink their product plans, and diesels could give them a way to meet increasingly tough global emissions and mileage standards. But, as it now stands, oil-burners are likely to face tough times in the coming years."

But a sea change is afoot that is forecast to kick gas-powered vehicles to the curb, replacing them with cars that run on batteries. A flurry of news this week underscores just how rapidly that change could happen.

A quick recap: On Monday, Tesla announced that the Model 3, its mass-market electric car, would start rolling off production lines this week with the first handful delivered to customers later this month. Then on Wednesday, Volvo announced that every car it produces will have a battery in it by 2019, putting it at the forefront of major car manufacturers. Then came France’s announcement on Thursday that it would ban the sale of gas-powered cars by 2040.

All this news dropped just in time for Bloomberg New Energy Finance's latest electric car report, which lays out why electric cars are the way of the future and when they’re projected to take over the market. The authors said although electric vehicles are currently a tiny fraction of the car market, that market could reach an inflection point sometime between 2025-2030. After that, electric car sales are slated to increase rapidly.

Related: Driving on Roads of the Future Will Be a Real Trip

Driven by the falling cost of batteries and the growing number of automakers producing a wider variety of electric cars, Bloomberg NEF expects that electric cars will account for 54 percent of all car sales globally by 2040. That’s a huge uptick from its forecast last year of electric vehicles accounting for 35 percent of all sales.

The shift to electric vehicles will disrupt the fossil fuel industry. The 530 million total electric cars forecast to be on the road by 2040 will require 8 million fewer barrels of oil a day to run.

A new forecast for electric cars shows explosive growth in new sales, particularly in China. Bloomberg NEF

One of the big pitches for electric cars is their positive benefit for the climate because they reduce the use of oil. But they will require a lot more power from the electric grid. Energy use from electric vehicles is expected to rise 300 times above current demand, putting more strain on power generation.

How that energy is produced will go a long way toward determining how climate-friendly electric cars actually are. A recent Climate Central analysis looked at all 50 states and found that the energy mix was clean enough in 37 of them to ensure electric cars are more climate friendly than their most fuel-efficient combustion engine counterparts.

Related: Why Flying Cars Still Haven't Gotten Off the Ground

That’s a sharp uptick from a 2013 analysis, which found that there were just 13 states where electric cars were cleaner than gas-powered ones, and it’s driven in large part by a precipitous drop in coal use.

While the U.S. is projected to be one of the biggest drivers of the electric vehicle revolution, China and the European Union will also be major players. By 2025, Bloomberg NEF’s projections show that China will be the biggest buyer of electric vehicles in the world, a trend that continues through 2040.

That means how China's energy mix develops will be one of the most important factors to determining how climate friendly all the new electric vehicles on the road will be.

It issued a reminder this week that swapping out artery-clogging saturated fats such as butter with healthy vegetable fats can do as much good for some people as taking a statin drug.

A car makes its way on a road through flowering canola fields on a serpentine section of the L401 highway near Nienstedt, Germany on May 12, 2016. Julian Stratenschulte / dpa via AP

“Scientific studies that lowered intake of saturated fat and replaced it with polyunsaturated vegetable oil reduced cardiovascular disease by approximately 30 percent; similar to cholesterol-lowering drugs, known as statins,” the organization said in a ""presidential advisory.""

These experts stress the word “replace.” That means not just cutting the bad fats — it also means adding the “good” fats, such as corn, soybean and peanut oil.

One reminder that may surprise some people — coconut oil may come from a tree, but it’s not a particularly healthful fat.

“Several studies found that coconut oil — which is predominantly saturated fat and widely touted as healthy — raised LDL cholesterol the same way as other saturated fats found in butter, beef fat and palm oil,” said the American Heart Association advisory, which published in the journal Circulation.

Another possible surprise: All fats are a mix of saturated, polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats. The Heart Association said polyunsaturated fats appear to lower the risk of heart disease the most, followed by monounsaturated fats. Saturated fats are the least desirable.

The advisory also lists which fats are healthier:

Safflower oil: 75 percent polyunsaturated fat

Sunflower oil: 66 percent polyunsaturated fat

Canola oil: 63 percent monounsaturated/ 28 percent polyunsaturated fat

Corn oil: 55 percent polyunsaturated fat/ 28 percent monounsaturated fat

Olive oil: 73 percent monounsaturated fat

Peanut oil: 46 percent monounsaturated fat/ 32 percent polyunsaturated fat

Butter: 63 percent saturated fat/ 26 percent monounsaturated fat

Coconut oil: 82 percent saturated fat

Lard: 39 percent saturated fat/45 percent monounsaturated fat

Palm oil: 82 percent saturated fat/ 11 percent monounsaturated fat

Heart disease is the No. 1 killer in the U.S. and in most industrialized countries. “Nearly 808,000 people in the United States died of heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases in 2014, translating to about one of every three deaths,” the Heart Association said.

The Heart Association and American College of Cardiology advise anyone with questionable cholesterol readings to get saturated fat down to just 5 percent of total calories.

Related: Heart attacks, strokes fell after trans-fat ban

“We want to set the record straight on why well-conducted scientific research overwhelmingly supports limiting saturated fat in the diet to prevent diseases of the heart and blood vessels,” said Dr. Frank Sacks, lead author of the advisory and professor of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

“Saturated fat increases LDL — bad cholesterol — which is a major cause of artery-clogging plaque and cardiovascular disease.”

Saturated fats are found in meat, full-fat dairy products and tropical oils such as coconut, palm and others.

“A healthy diet doesn’t just limit certain unfavorable nutrients, such as saturated fats, that can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and other blood vessel diseases. It should also focus on healthy foods rich in nutrients that can help reduce disease risk, like poly- and mono-unsaturated vegetable oils, nuts, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish and others,” Sacks said."
50,http://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/what-keeps-modern-dads-night-ncna773101,nbcnews,Move over 'mom guilt' -- now it's dad's turn,[],"Dads these days are more involved with their children than ever before… and as this Father's Day rolls around, they might be more conflicted about their role than any previous generation of fathers.

An online survey of more than 1,200 dads conducted by TODAY.com in partnership with Fatherly.com found that modern dads are navigating challenges like “dad guilt” and “stay-at-home dad envy” — concepts their own fathers would scarcely recognize.

Nearly two-thirds of working dads surveyed (63 percent) said they envy stay-at-home dads.

And, we found out how many are secretly hiding in the bathroom instead of helping out with the kids.

Dad Guilt: It's A Thing

About one in five (19 percent) said they feel guilt about not being “present” enough with their children and 17 percent said they suffer from “dad guilt” about working too much.

But dads still feel that traditional pressure to be the breadwinner. About one in four (28 percent) reported they feel “dad guilt” about not making enough money to provide for their family the way they’d like to.

“That’s the dilemma” of modern fatherhood, said Joshua David Stein, the editor-at-large of Fatherly and father of two sons. Of course, he noted, working moms have been feeling this push-and-pull between career and family for decades now — and dads are just catching up. In a way, he said, the torn feelings of dads represent progress.

Doyin Richards felt guilty about missing out on time with his children when he worked a corporate job. ""I spent the majority of my days wishing I was at home with my young daughters,"" Richards said. So he left the 9-5 office life to be a stay-at-home, work-at-home dad, and said he never looked back. ""It was easily the best decision I've ever made in my life.""

Asked whether they’d rather get to spend more time with their children or get a raise at work, dads were evenly split, with 51 percent choosing more family time and 49 percent opting for the raise.

On the Other Hand, Dad guilt? What's That?

But not all dads are agonizing over their life choices. In fact, they’re a pretty cheerful bunch overall. A quarter of dads (26 percent) said they don’t feel dad guilt at all — they do their best, and they don’t feel bad about it — a refreshing attitude.

Working moms have been feeling this push-and-pull between career and family for decades now — and dads are just catching up.

Richards said he understands the lack of guilt. ""Now that I left my corporate job, I don't feel any dad guilt whatsoever because my schedule is flexible enough to spend as much time with my daughters as I would like,"" he said. ""On the flip side, I bet there are some dads who are never at home due to work commitments and also don't feel any dad guilt because they believe making money is what they're supposed to do for their families.""

Fathers are not too worried about what others think of them, either. More than half (56 percent) say they don't feel judged by other parents for their parenting choices. Among those who DO feel judged, dads are 14 times as likely to say they feel judged by moms than by other dads.

When it comes to pulling their weight at home, 50 percent of dads say their partner does more of the childcare than they do but only 10 percent feel guilty about not contributing more at home. Half of dads say they “never” hide or feign incompetence to avoid childcare, while 26 percent admit they sometimes pull the old “hide in the bathroom trick,” a very honest three percent said they do it “often,” and 21 percent said “just that one time.” Suuuuuuure… we know the truth now!

""I don't care if you're a mom or a dad, we've all done the 'hide in the bathroom trick,'"" Richards said. ""Many parents try to act as if they're above this sort of thing, but most of us aren't (myself included). Just own it and understand that it's part of parenting.""

Pepe’s inventor, artist and illustrator Matt Furie, drew the green frog in an open casket as part of a one-page strip for publisher Fantagraphics Books on Saturday marking Free Comic Book Day.

Furie also posted an image on his Tumblr showing the frog in the casket, linking to an article on Comic Book Resources announcing the character's demise.

""While it’s unlikely Pepe’s official death will stop extremists from co-opting his image, this was, perhaps, the most effective way for Furie to reclaim his character; Pepe’s soul has returned to his creator. Rest in Peace,"" CBR author Shaun Manning said in the post.

The frog began as a harmless cartoon in 2005, Furie has said, in the Fantagraphics' comic book “Boy’s Club.” Pepe gained popularity over the next few years online as a meme before his more recent association with white supremacists, neo-Nazi groups and the so-called “alt-right.”

The Anti-Defamation League launched a #SavePepe campaign in October, in an attempt to reclaim the positive message originally behind the meme. Pepe the Frog had previously been declared a hate symbol by the ADL.

Furie said in a post on TIME’s website the day before the campaign was launched that it was “completely insane that Pepe has been labeled a symbol of hate, and that racists and anti-Semites are using a once peaceful frog-dude from my comic book as an icon of hate.”

The ADL said that while cartoon’s origins were inoffensive, it had been increasingly appropriated for “bigoted themes” in ""a tendency exacerbated by the controversial and contentious 2016 presidential election.""

I admit, it’s not as easy as ordering in from the local pizza joint, but the effort you put in can really pay off on your waistline and long-term wellness. One study from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Research found that meals cooked at home are healthier, with home chefs who cook most often consuming fewer calories, carbohydrates and sugar compared to those who report cooking the least. In this study, people who reported participating in meal prep six or seven nights a week — I know, a lot! — also made healthier choices on the occasions they ate out. Cooking at home has also been linked to higher consumption of fruits and veggies — both fresh and otherwise — a factor that is key to optimizing your health.

To get you more excited about meal prep, I’ve asked some of the nation’s leading dietitians—food pros who know their way around healthy eating—for their go-to kitchen gadgets that make meal prep as easy as possible. Happy cooking!

1. Microplane

Rachel Begun, MS, RDN, nutrition advocate and certified natural chef in Los Angeles, CA, loves her many microplanes! “The microplane is a small investment that delivers big flavor to everyday meals. It grates citrus rinds, ginger, turmeric, hard cheeses, and whole spices, such as nutmeg and cinnamon. It also shaves chocolate for the perfect desert topping. The best part is that when you grate or shave these ingredients, a little amount goes a long way to flavor foods,” she explains.

Begun recommends using the tool in her summery recipe for Strawberry Lemon Shortbread Cookies. “It uses lemon zest to add zing to the cream, which is a nice balance to the sweet strawberries and vanilla shortbread,” she says.

Julie Harrington, RD, Culinary Nutrition Consultant in Morristown, NJ is also a fan of this small but mighty tool. She uses it to make quick work of grating to add flavor and freshness to dishes like her Crepes with a Strawberry Lemon Ricotta Filling and Broccoli & Cauliflower Salad.

2. Veggie Spiralizer

Chef Julie Andrews, MS, RD, CD in Madison, WI can’t live without her spiralizer. This gadget is useful for turning veggies — from zucchini to beets — into noodle-like strands. Though I typically use it to create a stand-in for pasta, she shows you how to create Crispy Beet and Sweet Potato Fries, a vibrant, nutrition-packed, and lighter take on traditional curly fries. I think even picky eaters (read: kids) will try this colorful creation.

3. Stand Mixer

All of my foodie friends swear by this small countertop appliance — even those living in New York City apartments with tight kitchens. Sara Hass, RDN, Culinary Nutritionist in Chicago, IL could not agree more. “I would love to say I could mix everything by hand all of the time, but time won’t allow for that. Not when I work from home while managing my little sous chef! My stand mixer makes my life easier and cooking and baking more efficient,” she says. Trust her and try using this timesaving tool in her lightened up baked goodies like Toasted Coconut Cupcakes, Super Easy Graham Cracker Pancakes, and Banana Coconut Bundt Cake.

4. Food Brush

“I can’t live without my food brush,” says Keri Gans, RDN, Nutritionist in New York City and author of The Small Change Diet. Sometimes people go a little crazy with the oil when grilling, but Gans recommends brushing fish, chicken, veggies, or sliced potatoes with a little oil instead. “I brush just a little amount to perfectly cover both sides before adding herbs and spices,” she says. Also known as a silicone basting brush, Gans swears this handy helper will reduce clean-up time, too. “Before I discovered this gadget, I was using my fingers and this is far easier and a whole lot less messy!”

5. Ginger Grater

“I love ginger for its anti-inflammatory effects and ability to open up sinuses and boost circulation and metabolism. But I also love the flavor,” says Cynthia Sass MPH, RD, CSSD, in New York City and author of Slim Down Now. “I add fresh grated ginger to nearly everything, including iced water, homemade salad dressing, marinades, and stir fry sauces; fold it into nut butter; blend it into smoothies and puddings; and stir it into melted dark chocolate,” she explains.

My mouth is watering at the thought of melted dark chocolate with fresh grated ginger, but Sass also uses the spice in savory foods. “Combine ginger with ground cinnamon to season lentil soup and oven roasted chickpeas,” she suggests. “It's one of my top my can't-live-without ingredients, and my grater makes super easy to prepare.”

Try her Cherry Chocolate Green Goddess Smoothie made with—what else?—fresh, grated ginger.

6. Small Kitchen Scoop

Dawn Jackson Blatner, RDN in Chicago, IL and author of The Superfood Swap recommends this mini ice cream-style scooper for a “clean, easy, and portioned way to make everything from healthy cookies to lentil meatballs to energy bites.”

“As a registered dietitian nutritionist, I love that it adds an element of portion control, but it also makes your recipes look totally professional,” she explains. Another claim to fame for the small kitchen scoop: Jackson Blatner uses it in the CUBS clubhouse to scoop sticky things like nut butters, coconut oil, and raw honey into protein shakes without making a mess.

Her PB & Flax Energy Bites are packed with good-for-you ingredients and she offers clever ideas for enjoying them, like using the bites atop your favorite smoothie. At this point I’m wondering how I have managed to live without this tool. (Thank goodness for Amazon Prime!)

7. Citrus Reamer

“To provide balance in a recipe, such as balancing bitterness, I often rely on culinary acids, especially lemon juice,” explains Jackie Newgent, RDN, culinary nutritionist in Brooklyn, NY, and author of The All-Natural Diabetes Cookbook. “The fastest and easiest way to get fresh juice from ‘produce to plate’ is by using a citrus reamer!”

Newgent’s in-season Orzo, Greens & Pan-Charred Corn Salad makes use of this low-investment kitchen item. I have a feeling this is one gizmo that won’t get lost in the back of the drawer!

8. Nutribullet

Alissa Rumsey, MS, RD, author of Three Steps to a Healthier You, loves the versatility of this blender. “I use it to make smoothies, chop nuts, grind spices, make nut butter, and turn rolled oats into oat flour,” she says. Need some recipe inspo? Her Powered-Up Smoothie Bowl is a fun and flavorful way to pack in seasonal produce.

Alexis Joseph, MS, RD, LD, Founder of Hummusapien.com and Co-Founder of Alchemy in Columbus, OH is another fan of the Nutribullet. Her pretty-in-pink Grapefruit Smoothie Bowl has an always-in-season surprise: frozen cauliflower florets. What a creative way to boost fiber and nutrients!

Kaleigh McMordie, MCN, RD, intuitive eating dietitian in Lubbock, TX, also swears by this multi-purpose appliance. “It’s easier to clean than a blender, and a little less bulky than many appliances. I especially love it when I only need to make a small batch of something, such as salsa,” she says. Take her word for it and whip up a batch of fresh Roasted Garlic Hummus. Slice up some summery zucchini and dip away!

9. Mandoline

When it comes to making quick prep of shredding and slicing veggies, Kara Lydon, RD, LDN, RYT, Intuitive Eating Dietitian and Yoga Teacher based in Boston turns to her mandoline. “I love using it to make coleslaw, veggie ribbons for salads, and veggie chips and fries! This gadget comes in especially handy when making my Dehydrated Parmesan Truffle Zucchini Chips, perfect for this time of year while zucchini is abundant at farmer's markets,” she notes.

10. Chef’s Knife

No kitchen would be complete without this essential, according to McMordie. “Having a great Chef's knife really eliminates the need for a bunch of other tools in the kitchen.” So true! You’ll want to grab the cutting board and sharpen your knife for this stunning Summery Strawberry Peach Burrata Salad."
53,http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/nigeria-president-buhari-pictured-london-after-three-months-grid-n785856,nbcnews,Nigerian President Buhari Pictured in London After Three Months Off Grid,['Eoghan Macguire'],"LONDON — After a blackout of close to three months — and a blizzard of speculation — Nigerians have caught sight of their elusive leader, 3,000 miles from home.

President Muhammadu Buhari has not been seen since leaving Africa's most populous country, which is battling an economic crisis, terrorism and a regional famine, for medical treatment at the beginning of May.

In his absence, questions have been raised over whether he will be able to seek a second term in 2019 elections. Earlier this year, some even asked whether Buhari was still alive.

However, pictures released on Twitter by the president's office appear to show Buhari meeting a delegation of governors from his APC political party in London.

“The president sends his best wishes to all Nigerians. He will be back to Nigeria as soon as his doctors give the go-ahead,” the text of one of Sunday's tweets said.

Buhari's supporters have criticized the speculation over Buhari's health as ""fake news.""

Little information has been released about the 74-year-old’s condition or the ailment he has been receiving treatment for.

He first left Nigeria for the UK in January before returning home two months later.

That trip was initially billed as a ""short annual vacation"" during which time he would undergo some ""routine medical check-ups.""

However, just before he was due to return, Nigeria’s 180 million citizens were informed via a statement that Buhari would be “extending his vacation.”

Although he returned home in March, Buhari was rarely seen in public and was last glimpsed welcoming back a group of 82 schoolgirls released by the militant group Boko Haram shortly before he left for London a second time.

Elizabeth Donnelly, deputy head of the Africa Program at U.K. think tank, Chatham House, said the latest image was likely designed “to calm the speculation” over his protracted absence.

She added that it may also be an attempt to curb ""political maneuvering"" and maintaining order in the corridors of power in Abuja.

With elections due within two years, Donnelly says potential presidential candidates have been looking ahead and plotting a potential 2019 campaign should Buhari be unable to run.

In the meantime, vice president Yemi Osinbajo has been acting as president.

Nigeria is Africa’s most populous nation and the continent’s biggest oil producer. Yet it faces numerous pressing challenges in the short-term.

These include the Boko Haram insurgency and famine-like conditions in the country’s northeast, unrest due to militancy in the oil producing Niger Delta region as well as an economy struggling to get back to growth after plunging into recession last year.

Buhari isn’t the first Nigerian president to seek lengthy medical treatment outside of the country. In 2010, Umaru Yar'Adua died of a kidney condition after officials had attempted to keep details of his illness quiet. He had been whisked away to a German hospital for treatment during the 2007 presidential campaign.

While it is not ideal to have a president absent for so long, Donnelly said there had at least been a formal and transparent process over who is running the country.

Nigeria’s Vanguard newspaper reported a statement from presidential advisor Femi Adesina in which he relayed the comments of Imo State Governor, Rochas Okorocha after a meeting with Buhari in London. Buhari was “very cheerful and has not lost any bit of his sense of humor,” Okorocha was quoted as saying.

“By our visit to London today, the merchants of lies have been put out of business and Nigerians will not buy the garbage they have been selling. All those who look up to fake news can find better use for their time,” Okorocha added, according to the statement.

However, Nigerians will continue to wonder when, or even if, their president will return, said Donnelly.

""It's a long time away,"" she said. ""Whether he will go back or not, speculation will continue."""

Obdulia Sánchez. Merced County Sheriff's Office

Obdulia Sánchez, 18, of Stockton, was behind the wheel of a 2003 Buick when the vehicle veered onto the right shoulder of the road in Los Banos, near Modesto, on Friday, the California Highway Patrol said. She overcorrected, causing the vehicle to swerve across lanes, crash through a wire fence and overturn into a field, authorities said.

Sánchez's 14-year-old sister, Jacqueline Sánchez Estrada, was killed, and another 14-year-old passenger was injured in her leg. Neither was wearing a seatbelt, investigators said.

Sánchez pleaded not guilty by video Wednesday afternoon in Merced County Superior Court to a count of gross vehicular manslaughter, a count of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, two counts of driving under the influence resulting in injury and two counts of driving with an elevated blood alcohol content causing injury. She was ordered held on $560,000 bail pending a bond hearing on Friday and a preliminary hearing on Aug. 9.

In a video posted on Instagram, Sánchez is seen outside the car with what appears to be Jacqueline's body. The other teen can be seen trying to wave down help.

""I f-----g killed my sister, OK? I know I’m going to jail for life,"" Sánchez says in the video. ""This is the last thing I wanted to happen, OK? I don""t f-----g care, though. I'm going to hold it down. Rest in peace, sweetie. If you don't survive, I am so f-----g sorry.""

Chief Deputy District Attorney Harold Nutt said the driving violations carried enhanced ""great bodily damage"" penalties. If she's convicted, Sánchez could face as long as 13 years and eight months in state prison.

""Certainly, anybody can say very easily that she is responsible for the death. She believes that, too,"" Ramnik Samrao, Sánchez's public defender, told reporters after the hearing. ""She's said multiple times, for anybody that's seen the video: 'I killed my sister. I killed my sister.'

""So there's no doubt about that,"" Samrao said. ""But whether a crime was actually committed, that's a separate story.""

Samrao urged people to imagine what they would do if they were ever in Sánchez's situation.

""I think it's absolutely unfortunate that so many people would rush to judge her on a few minutes of her life, not having known anything about her,"" he said. ""Nobody knows how they would react when your sibling dies in your arms."""

The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke defines Bell's palsy as a form of temporary facial paralysis resulting from damage or trauma to the facial nerves. Bell's palsy affects the function of the facial nerve, causing an interruption in the messages the brain sends to the muscles in the face, leading to weakness or paralysis in the area.

According to Dr. Matthew Hirsch, a facial plastic and reconstructive surgeon at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, it almost always occurs on one side of the face, but can happen on both.

""It's not uncommon, and is more common in those who are 15 to 40 years old,"" Hirsch said. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke reports that it afflicts approximately 40,000 Americans each year.

Hirsch noted that while trauma to the face, surgeries and ear infections can result in facial weakness, they wouldn't cause Bell's palsy. The condition is medically defined as a weakness of the face without an identifiable cause. Most in the medical profession believe that a virus causes it, but that has not been proven.

""Bell's palsy refers to a specific scenario where the patient experiences a fairly rapid onset of weakness of both the upper and lower face, without any identifiable cause. This frequently occurs within 72 hours,"" Hirsch explained.

Most people think they've had a stroke, he added.

Patients should visit a doctor as soon as they recognize the weakness or paralysis. Prescribed treatment is typically oral steroids and anti-viral medications, which greatly increase the odds of a full recovery.

Even without treatment, up to two-thirds of people will have a normal return to function.

""It can take six months to a year for the nerve to recover as much as it's going to recover,"" Hirsch said.

Hirsch said there are a lot of options for people with an incomplete recovery, including:

physical therapy

Botox

surgical options, ranging from small procedures to bring symmetry to the resting face, to bigger surgeries where nerve grafts are taken from other parts of the body, and muscle transfers, to make the mouth move again.

Jolie told Vanity Fair that she has recovered from the condition, thanks to acupuncture, although Hirsch said there's not enough evidence to recommend the treatment, ""one way or another.""

""A lot of my patients have already had acupuncture done. (Their) opinion is mixed,"" Hirsch said.

There is one crucial piece of advice for patients with an incomplete recovery, or those who have had a full recovery, but still have issues with their facial functions: See a specialist.

""If they are diagnosed with it, or not given a clear diagnosis, I'd recommend seeing someone who specializes in this condition (like a facial plastic surgeon) to receive appropriate treatment and management,"" Hirsch warned, stressing that a lot of doctors are unaware of all the options for patients."

But what if you could tap a button on your smartphone to have a car pull up moments later, you slip inside, falling into a plush recliner like the one you wish you had in your living room. Within moments, you’re catching a little extra sleep while the driverless vehicle navigates its way to your office.

That might seem like a scene out of a science fiction movie, but it’s likely to become reality sooner than you realize. In Phoenix, Google spin-off Waymo is already letting residents participate in a pilot ride-sharing program using a small fleet of self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans.

The first fully autonomous vehicles are expected to go on sale by 2020, and completely driverless models may follow by as early as 2022, according to plans laid out by both Ford and Daimler.

The convergence of self-driving vehicles and ride-sharing services will do more than make commuting easier, according to a new study by computer tech giant Intel. It envisions these emerging technologies will transform the nation as radically as the arrival of the original automobile did early in the 20th Century — in the process creating a “passenger economy” that will generate revenues of as much as $7 trillion by 2050.

From Driver to Rider

We are heading towards a situation where “we humans become riders, instead of drivers,” said Doug Davis, an Intel vice president and co-author of the new study. “At the end of the day, this presents a huge opportunity.”

It’s often said that the automobile has shaped the face of America, allowing the creation of the nation’s sprawling suburbs and creating a vast network of drive-through restaurants, malls, and gas stations. We’ve already begun seeing a modest return to urban living as Americans grow tired of long, slow commutes. But the new transportation era could trigger even more population shifts.

By making it easier and more affordable to get around without having to have a home with a garage, it could encourage more people to return to cities. On the other hand, autonomous vehicles are expected to make roads safer and flow more smoothly, which might encourage more people to move even further out into exurbs and rural areas.

“We could see a situation where people are (quite) willing to commute several hours a day,” said Greg Lindsay, one of the survey participants and a senior fellow at the non-profit New Cities Foundation, during an Intel conference call.

Various studies issued this year, including ones from consultancies Boston Consulting Group and RethinkX, have projected that by 2030 anywhere from 25 percent to as much as 95 percent of the miles Americans travel by road will be done in driverless, electrified vehicles operated by ride-sharing services.

No More Car Payments

The BCG study estimated that in many parts of the country, within the next decade or two, it will cost less than half as much to use a driverless ride-sharing service as it would to own a car. One of the other advantages is that this will democratize transportation, especially in poorer communities where residents often find it difficult to get good jobs because they can’t afford a car and don’t have access to mass transit.

But here's where Intel’s study pokes at the great unknown. Just as the arrival of the Model T encouraged roadside services to pop up and grab commuters and suburbanites going from Point A to Point B, might entrepreneurs come up with a whole new landscape of mobility-as-a-service opportunities, the authors ask.

Related: Self-Driving Cars Will Turn Intersections Into High-Speed Ballet

If they aren’t driving, passengers would be able to nap, play, dine or put in a little extra work time. But the study anticipates the possibility that instead of just summoning up a generic Uber or Lyft a passenger could have a ride-sharing vehicle pull up at the end of the workday with a hot meal waiting, or their shopping all done and waiting in the trunk, perhaps even a stylist to give you a haircut or a manicure and pedicure on the way home.

The $7 trillion figure forecast for mobility services in 2050 breaks down into

$3.7 trillion, or 55 percent, for consumer services

$3 trillion, or 43 percent, for business-to-business services, such as office supply deliveries

$203 billion for other new vehicle-related services and features.

So What Happens to Detroit?

One of the other big questions is who will benefit from the emergence of the passenger economy? Today, carmakers are focused on selling sheet metal, and traditional manufacturers — such as Ford, Toyota and Volkswagen — likely will continue to produce a major share of the cars on the road. But how many cars will be needed is unclear. Recently ousted Ford CEO Mark Fields, a proponent of the passenger economy, said he expects sales could drop sharply over the next 10 to 15 years as ride-sharing catches on.

To make up for lost revenue, said the Intel report, “Carmakers may ultimately vie (with services like Lyft and Uber) to operate particular networks of vehicles for particular cities.” And they will focus more on generating service business than manufacturing and car sales.

But new players, including up-start carmakers like Tesla, tech firms like Waymo, and ride-sharing firms like Uber and Lyft, all will be seeking to dominate, or at least grab a piece of this huge new economic pie.

Whoever comes to lead the new passenger economy, it “will reconfigure time and then space, to some extent, and will ultimately lead to changes in land use and services,” said Lindsay, resulting in “a massive reconfiguring of the U.S.”"
62,http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/anti-semitism-claims-hound-u-k-s-labour-party-despite-n781621,nbcnews,Anti-Semitism Claims Hound U.K.’s Labour Party Despite Rise in Polls,['Rachel Elbaum'],"LONDON — Britain’s Labour Party is riding high in the polls, but some of its most loyal members find themselves wavering in their support because of what they see as an increase in anti-Semitism that they consider to be linked to the party.

Take Steve, who voted for Labour in every election since coming of age, campaigned for the party many times and helped run his local branch.

Still, the 45-year-old psychologist says his hand hesitated over the ballot as he got ready to vote in the last election in June.

“This was the first time in my life that I’ve struggled to vote for Labour — I’ve been a proud member of the party my entire life,” said Steve, from the northern town of Derby, who asked that his full name not be used for fear of retaliation in his local party.

Steve paused before voting for Labour because of what he sees as an increase of anti-Semitism both online and in real life under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, a socialist who has seen newfound prestige thanks to his party’s better-than-expected results in the summer's national election.

""There are members of my local branch that now won't speak with me because they know I'm Jewish,"" he said. ""This was never the case and only started in the last two years.""

A survey conducted just before the election by polling company Survation and The Jewish Chronicle newspaper found that Labour held the backing of only 13 percent of British Jews. In recent years, the party has come under criticism for its leader's past ties with anti-Israel groups, and what they say is light discipline of members who have made anti-Semitic comments.

Corbyn’s office didn’t respond to requests for a comment for this article.

'An occasionally toxic atmosphere'

“There’s a certain section of his supporters, not all of them, that really struggle to understand that you can be a Jew and in the party and also support Israel without being a supporter of the right wing,” said Hannah, who asked that her name not be used for fear for her safety. “It’s black and white to them. If you have any sympathy for Israel, they are triggered and can’t control themselves.”

Hannah said that since Corbyn became the Labour Party's leader in 2015, she has received “countless” anti-Semitic messages on social media, including a particularly distressing photo of a man with a knife in his back and the caption, “Serves him right, he trusted a k---,"" using racial slur for someone of Jewish descent.

The party itself appears to be taking these fears seriously, commissioning a report into anti-Semitism in April 2016. It found that there was “an occasionally toxic atmosphere” in the party, but that it “is not overrun by anti-Semitism, Islamophobia or other forms of racism.”

Yet the concerns are persistent, marking a sharp departure for Labour, which has repeatedly sponsored legislation promoting equality in the U.K., including on pay, gender and religion.

For most of its history, Labour was the most pro-Jewish and pro-Zionist of all the major political parties in the country, according to Daniel Allington, a professor of sociology at Leicester University who researches the rise of anti-Semitism on the left.

However, over the past three years, its leadership has been more critical of Israel's policies, and Corbyn has said that he would immediately recognize a state of Palestine if he became prime minister, which some see as dangerous if it came with no political conditions attached.

Corbyn's controversial 'friends'

Corbyn himself used to be a millstone around the Labour Party’s neck — in June 2016, a majority of his own legislators in Parliament passed a motion of no confidence in the vain hope that he would quit.

Now, the opposition leader, who is strongly against nuclear weapons and who believes in the re-nationalization of the railways and other public services, has helped his party overtake the Conservative Party in the polls. The most recent YouGov poll showed an 8-point lead for Labour.

In addition to accusations that Corbyn hasn’t cracked down hard enough on hostility to Jews, he himself has a mixed history with the Jewish community. Reading through his past comments about Israel — which plays a strong role in the identity of many British Jews — is jarring in comparison to comments by other political leaders, past and present.

At the unveiling of the report into anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, Corbyn seemed to compare Israel to the ISIS terror group, shocking many of his own Labour legislators.

“The Jewish community was seeing [anti-Semitic incidents] as a course of conduct and Labour was seeing it as isolated events”

“Our Jewish friends are no more responsible for the actions of Israel or the [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu government than our Muslim friends are for those various self-styled Islamic states or organisations,"" he said at the event.

A bigger issue for many was Corbyn’s invitation to representatives of Hamas and Hezbollah to an event in Parliament in 2009, when he was a rebellious Labour MP and not in the government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Both groups are classified by the U.K. and U.S. as terrorist groups, and have repeatedly called for the destruction of the State of Israel.

At the time, he called the groups “friends,” while also commenting that they’re “dedicated toward the good of the Palestinian people and bringing about long-term peace and social justice and political justice.”

After becoming Labour leader he said he regretted calling them “friends.”

In addition, his paid appearances before he became leader on Iran-owned Press TV, a station now banned in the U.K., have won him few admirers in the Jewish community.

“I don’t believe for a minute that Jeremy Corbyn is an anti-Semite,” said Harry Fletcher, a former Corbyn adviser who helped with his 2015 leadership campaign. “It’s an institutional thing. It’s not conscious. It’s mixed up with the left of the party, which has complete antipathy to State of Israel and many would say that it shouldn’t exist.”

Tumultuous time for party

Corbyn’s newfound popularity comes after a tumultuous two years in the party, including the suspensions of high-profile Labour politicians, such as powerful former London Mayor Ken Livingstone.

In April 2016, Livingstone insisted that Adolf Hitler supported Zionism. He was suspended from holding office in the party for two years, angering some who felt the punishment was too lenient and who wanted him expelled.

Meanwhile, in February 2016, the head of the Oxford University Labour Club resigned, describing “poisonous” attitudes among certain members of the club. He recounted members of the executive “throwing around the term ‘Zio,’” a slur for Zionists, and a former co-chair saying that “most accusations of anti-Semitism are just the Zionists crying wolf.”

A Labour Party investigation into the club found that there had been “some incidents of anti-Semitic behavior.”

Among those reporting anti-Semitic abuse were several Jewish members of Parliament, including Louise Ellman, who represents Liverpool Riverside. Not long after Corbyn took power, Ellman faced rowdy meetings in her district, with pro-Corbyn party members reportedly making anti-Semitic remarks and attacking her position on Israel.

She said the party is investigating the events.

“There are some individuals engaging in traditional anti-Semitism, such as making references to Jews financing slavery, and others who are anti-Zionist to the degree that they become associated with people who denigrate Jews as a whole,” said Ellman on the phone from her office in Parliament.

“Anti-Semitism is of concern, but there are many in the party who are outraged about what’s happening,” she added.

Influential voting bloc

To understand how extraordinary it is for a particular group to feel alienated from Labour, one must look at the party’s history.

Labour has traditionally stood against discrimination and many of its most influential members and vocal supporters have been Jewish. There are scores of former and current Jewish Labour members of Parliament, including former party leader Ed Milliband, who has Jewish heritage, but grew up an atheist.

And while there are only around 250,000 Jews in Britain today, their influence at the ballot box may be significant when no political party has an outright majority in Parliament.

According to an analysis by Allington, the sociology professor, there was a statistical relationship between a constituency’s Jewish population and its swing to the Labour candidate in this past election, belying trends in similar areas.

“The higher [an area’s] Jewish population, the lower the rise in the Labour vote this election,” he said. “If just two seats had gone the other way — with things being so finely balanced — it would have been much harder for the Conservative Party to form a government.”

The Conservative Party is eight seats short of a majority in Parliament and needed to secure the agreement of a small party from Northern Ireland to get their governing agenda through Parliament last month.

One of the main problems, according to Fletcher, is that Corbyn acknowledges individual incidents of anti-Semitism but does not see them as part of systemic problem.

“The Jewish community was seeing [anti-Semitic incidents] as a course of conduct and Labour was seeing it as isolated events,” said Fletcher. “They saw it as a pattern which led them to conclude that there must be deep-rooted anti-Semitism with Corbyn and the Labour Party, and he saw it as incidents he dealt with.”

'A lot more needs to be done'

With Corbyn and his left-wing of the party looking firmly entrenched for the foreseeable future, there does seem to be a desire to find a new working relationship between Labour and the Jewish community.

“Since the election the [inter-Labour] factional fight has died down a bit, and hopefully that will open space for trust, engagement and reconciliation on both sides,” said Alex Nunns, author of the upcoming book “The Candidate: Jeremy Corbyn's Improbable Path to Power.”

The Jewish Leadership Council, as well as the office of Shadow Minister Dawn Butler, who is responsible for interacting with minority communities on behalf of the Labour Party, declined to comment — noting that while discussions are ongoing they aren’t ready to speak publicly yet.

Despite what seems like a public détente between Corbyn, his supporters, and the Jewish community at the moment, Ellman notes there is still a lot of work to do to fight anti-Semitism in the party.

“There is a greater understanding of the nature of the problem,” said Ellman. “It’s an ongoing issue. It is changing slowly, but a lot more needs to be done.”"

Collins'],"From beloved classics like ""The Notebook"" and ""Pride and Prejudice"" — some romance novels have hit the big screen with a passion, satisfying book and film lovers alike.

Best-selling author, Beverly Jenkins is next in line, hoping her story “Deadly Sexy” can make some waves in the romantic film genre.

Author of over 35 books and novellas, “Ms. Bev,” as readers affectionately call her, has teamed up with Iris Bolling, CEO of Siri Austin Entertainment, to raise funds to produce her film. Bolling is also an award-winning author who turned her book series “The Heart” into a television production.

Jenkins adds to her collection of historical and contemporary multicultural romance novels with ""Deadly Sexy,"" a story based on a rich, smart and beautiful sports agent, Jessi Teresa — known as JT.

JT, never one to be considered a damsel in distress, finds herself in need of help when her Lexus breaks down on the California freeway. Reese Anthony, a trucker and former cop, comes to her aid.

While Alice Walker’s ""The Color Purple,"" Zora Neale Hurston’s ""Their Eyes Were Watching God,"" Toni Morrison’s ""Beloved"" and more recently, Steve Harvey’s ""Think Like A Man,"" are books that have transitioned to successful feature films — this is an industry rarity. Many Black romance novels are bound by the paper and hardback covers they’re given and their stories are never told three dimensionally.

With a GoFundMe page, a goal of $100,000 and only 30 days to reach it, Jenkins and Bolling have called on fans for their support.

“We’ve been waiting on Hollywood to green-light us for forever but no one seems very interested in our love stories—you don’t see us on the Hallmark channel, you don’t see us on Lifetime,"" Jenkins said in her GoFundMe video. ""So I would hope that the more authors that do collaborate and go ahead and green-light their own projects will get the cable folks and other people who do mainstream films curious about what we’re doing.”

On Twitter, fans of the franchise could not contain their excitement and tweeted with the hashtags #DeadlySexy and #DeadlySexyTheMovie.

“We’re trying to be very very creative about how to let the readers in, they can be in walk-in scenes, they can even audition for a part if they want,” added Jenkins, who is also the recipient of the 2017 Romance Writers of America Nora Roberts Lifetime Achievement Award.

“This has been a dream of mine since reading my first Beverly Jenkins novel. Contact me if you need help on your crew. I'm studying filmmaking in Detroit and would love to help,” wrote one woman who donated to the “Deadly Sexy - The Movie” fund.

Supporters can donate anywhere from $25, and receive a thank you letter from Beverly Jenkins, to $10,000, and receive VIP tickets to the film screening.

The money raised will go directly to the production of the film including cast, crew and equipment.

Siri Austin Entertainment prides itself on being a “gateway for authors to share their talents with the world through various mediums such as books and film.” Their first TV series ""The Heart,"" based on the novel written by Iris Bolling, has 2 seasons available on DVD. The production company's upcoming projects include ""Deadly Sexy"" and ""Night of Seduction"" by Iris Bolling.

Jenkins' fans are not the only ones showing their support. Her friends are supporting her as well, with personal videos posted on “Deadly Sexy - The Movie” GoFundMe page. A Grammy award-winning artist, book store owners, and author Katharine Ashe who gives her “Top 10 Reasons Why Beverly Jenkins Books Should Be Movies,"" have filmed video pleas.

Jenkins and Bolling believe that the production of ""Deadly Sexy"" “will give hope to those who dream of having their book made into a film.”

It seems emojis, those expressive pictures all over texts and Instagram, could actually help our love lives. In his new book, “The Emoji Code,” to be published in the U.S. in August by MacMillan Picador, British linguist Vyv Evans argues that emojis are making us better communicators.

Evans calls emojis a “near-universal form of communication,” replacing internet slang like LOL with the popular “face with tears of joy” emoji.

And while he says some see the little glyphs as “little more than an adolescent grunt,” Evans says those people couldn’t be more wrong.

Evans’ research found that 72 percent of 18- to 25-year-olds find it easier to express their emotions if they’re using emojis. And 80 percent of people in the U.K. said they use them.

There’s a reason for that: Digital communication has stripped away important context like gestures, facial expressions and tone of voice. Emails and texts often come across as more ambiguous — or mean-spirited — than intended.

Enter the emoji. Adding a little smiley face or winking eye can convey joking or sarcasm. A text that says “Sure, go ahead!” with a kissy face could read more like “sure … go ahead” without one.

A Match.com survey of singles in America found that people who use emojis went on more dates and were more likely to have sex than those who didn’t. More than half of singles who used emojis had sex in 2014, compared to 31 percent of singles who didn’t, according to the survey.

But being burned alive?

""Bad way to go,"" a character from the swords-and-sorcery show says during this week's season premiere.

Throughout history, death by burning has been portrayed as one of the worst ways to go. It makes for horror-inducing scenes not only on ""Game of Thrones,"" but also during episodes of PBS' ""Wolf Hall"" docudrama about King Henry VIII and the medieval milieu of 16th-century England.

As medieval as it sounds, death by burning is still a phenomenon in the 21st century — to such an extent that the physiology can be studied by forensic scientists. The victims range from the Jordanian jet pilot who was killed by ISIS terrorists this year, to the Africans and Haitians targeted by the practice known as ""necklacing,"" to January's killing of a newborn in New Jersey.

The conventional wisdom is that most fire deaths are caused by asphyxiation rather than the burning itself — but Valerie Rao, chief medical examiner for the city of Jacksonville, Florida, said that's not always the case for an execution-style burning.

""It depends on how fast this happens,"" Rao told NBC News. ""If you are burned to death, it's basically the burns that cause the death.""

Grim effects

Rao's analysis of the ""Forensic Pathology of Thermal Injuries"" for Medscape makes for difficult reading, and even more difficult viewing. The flesh is burned black, with ""skin splits"" exposing soft tissue. The effects of the heat on muscles warp the body into a boxer's ""pugilistic"" attitude. Black soot clogs the airway.

Historical accounts of the burning of Joan of Arc suggest that she died of smoke inhalation, but add that her body had to be set aflame two more times to burn it down completely to ash.

Other accounts report that the victims of a death-by-burning sentence were sometimes given the option of being strangled first, to spare them the extreme pain associated with the burning of the air passages. Yet another option involved tying a small barrel of gunpowder to the prisoners, to give them a quick and merciful death when the flames licked up.

Practical lessons

During her 35 years of forensic work, including 19 years in Miami, Rao has seen the effects of death by burning on drivers trapped in fiery automobile collisions, the targets of drug-related car bombings, and the victims of necklacing inflicted by bad elements in Florida's Haitian community.

""Initially it's sad,"" she said. ""But after a while, you say to yourself, 'If I'm going to do this, I'm going to have to separate the emotion from the work.'""

Are there any lessons to be learned by TV viewers who are getting a sanitized look at the grisly phenomenon? For Rao, the takeaways are far more pedestrian than Jon Snow's exploits on ""Game of Thrones,"" but also far more realistic: Install carbon monoxide detectors and smoke alarms in your home, change their batteries regularly, and don't use gas-powered generators or barbecues indoors.

""Those are very useful lessons that we've learned,"" Rao said.

Bennett never let her lack of design experience and business know-how hold her back. “I had fabrics and I had dreams and I had ideas,” said Bennett.

Fast forward five years, and Hedley & Bennett’s high-end, hand-crafted aprons have a fan base that stretches across 4,000 kitchens in the country. Celebrity chefs like Martha Stewart and Mario Batali have also been spotted wearing these vibrant, stand-out designs.

From the hardware to the fabrics, fashion in the food space has never looked better. “Teams are feeling way better and are more on brand,” says Bennett. “It’s like put this on, hold your head up high, and do a damn good job today.”

Her collection of what she calls “proper bad-ass aprons,” are created in a 14,000 square-foot workspace that is equipped with two tree houses and a zip line. When people stop by for a visit, Bennett says she often hears, “it’s like Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.”

The whimsical wonderland is bursting with creativity and bubbling with spirit, but make no mistake about it. This CEO is all about getting down to business. “That mentality of working with a sense of urgency really is a game changer, especially when you have a start-up.”

Bennett’s company is also serious about shining a spotlight on other innovators and start-ups in her industry. Not only does she open her factory doors to host events for brands like Shake Shack, but Bennett also likes to introduce products from other companies with every Hedley & Bennett shipment. “It’s connecting the community and being willing to share that platform. I think it’s awesome and I want to help my community grow.”

Already, Bennett has developed limited edition lines for big names like Sur la Table and Bon Appétit, and most recently, RED, a non-profit started by U2 front man Bono. “We’re growing together and doing something bigger and better for everybody.”"

A large review has found a 40-year plunge in sperm count, specifically in men from North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand — and the reason may be associated with common factors in our daily lives.

Scientists from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and Icahn School of Medicine in New York analyzed 185 studies from 1973 to 2011, including almost 43,000 men. The results were stunning: Researchers found a 52 percent decline in sperm concentration and a 59 percent decline in total sperm count.

The meta-analysis published in the Oxford University journal, Human Reproduction Update, shows that the continued decline doesn’t appear to be leveling off, raising questions about the future of male reproductive health in western males.

“It’s extremely worrisome,"" Dr. Shanna Swan, study author and professor of environmental medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine told NBC News. “For couples who are trying to conceive, this is a very severe problem and it’s difficult psychologically, but in the big scheme of things, this is also a major public health issue.”

The new paper doesn’t give reasons for the decline.

Related: You Won't Believe What Baby-Making Science Could Soon Deliver

But Swan says falling sperm counts have been linked to exposure to certain chemicals, especially for unborn boys in the womb.

“For example, a pregnant mother’s smoking has a more devastating effect on her son’s future sperm count than a man smoking as an adult,"" says Swan.

The same concept may also apply to other chemicals known as “endocrine disrupters” — substances found all over the world in water, soil and some foods. It has been hypothesized that these substances can find their way into male fetuses, disrupting hormones, potentially increasing the risk for future fertility problems. Studies are under way to establish a conclusive link between these chemicals and fertility.

But sperm count has broader health implications than just fertility.

“Male fertility predicts overall men’s health”, says Dr. Joseph Alukal, urologist and director of male reproductive health at NYU Langone Health. Studies have shown that lower sperm counts may predict shorter life expectancy and are associated with heart attacks.

What about Tighty Whities?

Cause-and-effect is unclear at this point, said Alukal. But there are culprits of modern life that both lower sperm count and increase the risk for other common health conditions: a sedentary lifestyle, often accompanied by a poor diet.

Brown, 18, was black and unarmed when he was fatally shot by white officer Darren Wilson on Aug. 9, 2014. Wilson was cleared of wrongdoing, but the shooting led to months of protests in the St. Louis suburb.

Wilson resigned in November 2014, soon after a St. Louis County grand jury decided not to indict him. The U.S. Department of Justice found no grounds to prosecute Wilson, but the shooting led to a Justice Department investigation that resulted in a consent agreement requiring Ferguson to make significant changes to address racial bias in its police department and municipal court.

Michael Brown Sr. and Lezley McMcSpadden sued the city, former Police Chief Tom Jackson and Wilson in 2015, citing a police culture hostile to black residents and claiming Wilson used excessive force.

Ferguson, Jackson and Wilson denied the allegations.

The parents also argued that the death of their son deprived them of financial support through his future potential wages.

U.S. District Judge E. Richard Webber approved the settlement but disclosed nothing about the amount, saying only that it was ""fair and reasonable compensation for this wrongful death claim and is in the best interests of each Plaintiff,"" with the money to be split between the parents.

Webber also wrote that the agreement ""shall remain sealed by this Court and shall be considered a closed record"" because disclosure of the information ""could jeopardize the safety of individuals involved in this matter, whether as witnesses, parties, or investigators.""

Craig Douglas, who goes by the name of NepentheZ on YouTube and has over 1.4 million subscribers on his channel, and his partner Dylan Rigby, ran a service to let users gamble with virtual currency that could be bought for real cash.

Douglas was ordered to pay £91,000 ($114,000) while Rigby got a £174,000 fine. Both men are from the U.K. and admitted to being directors of Game Gold Tradings Limited, a company which operated and advertised FutGalaxy.com — an unlicensed gambling website. The prosecution was brought by the U.K. Gambling Commission with the case decided on Monday.

The website allowed players to transfer virtual currency out of the FIFA 17 video game and use it to bet on real soccer matches and other games. Any winnings could then be transferred back into the game. In the FIFA games, which are made by EA Sports, there is no way to trade or sell coins that you buy. So black market sites have appeared online to facilitate this.

There is no official link between FIFA or EA Sports and the illegal website run by Douglas and Rigby. There are no accusations aimed at Electronic Arts or the makers of the video game.

District Judge McGarva described the offense as ""very grave"", and concluded that children had been gambling on the website but said it was impossible to know how many. He had been shown footage of a 12-year old boy gambling on the website, describing this as ""horrific"".

""This was one of the most serious cases that has been investigated and prosecuted by the Commission. Its gravity is reflected in the significant financial penalties imposed by the judge,"" Sarah Harrison, CEO of the Gambling Commission, said in a press release on Tuesday.

""The defendants knew that the site was used by children and that their conduct was illegal but they turned a blind eye in order to achieve substantial profits.""

In a series of tweets following the court case, Douglas said he owed ""a huge apology"" to his family and supporters.

Despite the case, Douglas continued to upload new videos to his YouTube page about FIFA, including one in which he issued an apology. Douglas said he pleaded guilty to two charges, but pleaded not guilty to others.

""I (pleaded) not guilty to the remaining charges including the charge of inviting children to gamble and they were accepted by the prosecution and were accepted by the courts. Trust me when I tell you as a lesson has been learnt, a very valuable lesson,"" Douglas said.

""I made a huge mistake. I did some things wrong. I was very naïve … And very arrogant."""

A Utah mother is sharing a heart-stopping video of her toddlers narrowly escaping tragedy after a dresser toppled onto them, hoping to raise awareness about the importance of safely securing furniture.

The video, captured on home surveillance footage last Thursday morning, shows Kayli Shoff's pajama-clad twin boys climbing onto a wide Ikea dresser in their room. As 2-year-old brothers Brock and Bowdy jump on the dresser and hang from its drawers, the furniture comes crashing down, pinning Brock's entire body underneath and catching Bowdy's feet.

""Obviously the weight of both of their bodies was too much for that dresser, so it came toppling over,"" Shoff, who lives in Orem, about 45 miles south of Salt Lake City, told NBC News on Tuesday.

Shoff said the boys had woken up early that morning. She estimated that up to seven minutes went by before she noticed the fallen dresser on the baby monitor. She ran to the boys' room, not knowing if they were injured.

In those terrifying moments before she got there, the video shows Bowdy had managed to wriggle himself out — and eventually edge the dresser just enough to free Brock, too.

""If you watch the video, I think he stops for about eight to 10 seconds and kind of analyzes the situation: My brother's crying, he's hurting, how can I help him?"" Shoff said.

The twin's mother said she hadn't heard the boys' cries, a thud, or anything out of the ordinary coming from their room.

""And that was the weird thing, because I always hear them cry or scream. We also had family staying with us and their room was right above Brock and Bowdy's room, and they didn't hear anything either,"" she added.

Shoff whisked both boys off to the pediatrician, where they were given a clean bill of health, she said.

A Consumer Product Safety Commission source told NBC News the agency plans to send an investigator to speak to her and her husband about the incident to gather more information.

Shoff knows the scenario could have played out very differently. Tipped furniture is a leading cause of death among kids, with one child dying every two weeks because of items such as dressers, TVs, or appliances landing on them and crushing their windpipe or striking them in the head, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

The agency recommends parents anchor furniture to the wall to prevent injury or death. Many dressers come with wall anchors. Inexpensive furniture straps can also be purchased separately at hardware stores or baby stores.

“ You need to tie your dresser down today, because honestly if you wait a day or two, you're just not going to get it done.”

The American Home Furnishings Alliance advises consumers to anchor all heavy furniture, not just the ones in children's rooms, and to verify that furniture meets industry standards for maintaining stability.

And advocacy groups such as Charlie's House offer childproofing safety checklists for parents to prevent tipping accidents or other tragedies around the home, including proper storage for cleaning products and how to block off fireplaces.

Shoff, who also has a 5-year-old son, says the dresser in their house has now been secured. Her husband, Ricky Shoff, who is a sales representative for the company that makes the home surveillance cameras that captured the incident, immediately bolted the dresser to the wall and took the knobs off of it so the boys can no longer climb up. He also put latches on the bottom drawers.

The dresser is made by Ikea, which just last month agreed to pay $50 million to the families of three children who were killed when their dressers tipped over and crushed them.

The dresser had come with wall anchors, but the Shoffs had never bothered to install them, thinking they didn't need them. The middle shelves of the dresser were already empty of clothing because the boys ""would just throw them out anyways,"" Shoff said.

Her clip of the dresser falling has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. While some commenters have given the Shoffs criticism for not preventing the accident, the majority have thanked them for sharing the video, Shoff said.

""I think we've made a big impact on people wanting to secure their dressers,"" she said. ""You need to tie your dresser down today because honestly, if you wait a day or two, you're just not going to get it done."""

Eisenstein'],"The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration just ordered Takata to order the recall of another 2.7 million potentially defective airbag inflators, a move that will cover vehicles sold by Ford, Mazda, and Nissan.

Earlier this week, Honda reported the death of a 12th American caused by faulty Takata airbags. Worldwide, at least 18 have been killed, with another 180 known to have been injured. About 70 million airbags have been covered by recalls in the U.S., a figure that grows to more than 100 million worldwide.

Takata declared bankruptcy last month, its assets sold to Detroit-based supplier Key Safety Systems. The move is expected to help speed up the production of replacement airbag inflators. A shortage of parts has meant extended wait times for many owners looking to get their vehicles repaired.

The latest recall covers 627,000 Nissan Versa passenger cars from the 2007 to 2012 model-years, with over 500,000 of them sold in the U.S.

Related: Honda Confirms 11th Death Related to Faulty Takata Airbags

Ford faces the biggest impact, with 2.2 million vehicles covered, though it has not yet released specific details. Mazda said only about 6,000 of its B-Series trucks will need to be repaired.

Less Than One-Third of America's 70M Faulty Airbags Have Been Fixed

The exact number of vehicles covered by the various Takata recalls to date has yet to be clarified, as some models use more than one of the faulty devices.

Initially, it was believed that a manufacturing problem at two North American factories caused Takata inflators to be vulnerable to use in warm, high humidity climates. That led to an early, geographically based recall. But as evidence mounted of problems in cooler, drier climes the recall was ramped up significantly and now extends to many other countries, as well.

Chinese regulators have been pressuring Takata and various automakers to speed up recalls, echoing the concerns of NHTSA and safety advocates in the U.S. According to federal data, barely one-third of the vehicles covered by previous Takata recall campaigns have been repaired so far.

A lack of spare parts has been one of the concerns, though the bankruptcy sale of Takata “will accelerate the removal of dangerous airbag inflators,” Peter Prieto, the court-appointed Chair Lead Counsel for many of the consumer plaintiffs taking legal action against the Japanese supplier, said last month.

Tough to Track Down Owners of Recalled Vehicles

Safety experts say the replacement parts shortage is just one of the problems, however. They also note that older vehicles covered by the recalls may have been sold multiple times, making it hard to trace current owners and advise them of the safety problem.

The latest expansion of the Takata recall has many safety advocates worried that the number of vehicles using faulty airbags could expand even further.

""Takata has told the public that their line of airbag inflators with moisture absorbent was safe. This recall now raises serious questions about the threat posed by all of Takata’s ammonium nitrate-based airbags,"" said U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat and frequent critic of Takata, in a statement. ""If even more are found to be defective, it will take us from the biggest recall ever to something that could become mind-boggling."""
79,http://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/what-those-inappropriate-dreams-really-mean-ncna785996,nbcnews,Have a racy dream about your boss last night? This is what it means,[],"Ever wake up in a sweat after having an, uhm, inappropriate dream about someone in your life you really shouldn't be thinking about in that way? While we can't exactly say that it happens to all of us, a study done by the University of Montreal did find that of the 3,500 participants surveyed, about 20 percent of women and 14 percent of men have had sexual dreams about a person who was ""off limits"" to them in the waking world.

If it's happened to you before, you know how awkward it can be to have to face the star of your dream in real life — and that uncomfortable moment is only magnified if that person happens to be your boss or your brother in law. But do we have any control over the things we dream about? What’s the catalyst behind these dreams about people in our lives who we know are not viable options? And what does it mean for us when we dream them?

A sex dream about your boss has more to do with how you view yourself. A sex dream about your boss has more to do with how you view yourself.

Here's a look at our dream process, why certain people appear in these subconscious scenarios while we sleep and a few tips for getting to the bottom of the real life reasons behind them.

How We Dream

Though there's still much to learn about the way we dream, Dr. A.J. Marsden, assistant professor of human services and psychology at Beacon College says there are a few theories that can help explain what goes on in our heads at night.

""Researchers know that 90 percent of dreaming occurs during REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep,"" she says. ""We have about 90-minute sleep cycles with REM sleep taking up more of that cycle the longer we sleep, which is why we usually remember the dreams we're having right when we wake up (during longer REM cycles)."" In terms of what's driving the trajectory of our dreams, Marsden says the areas of the brain that are most active are the ones that house our emotions. ""Specifically, the limbic system, responsible for dealing with both good and bad emotions,"" she says. ""The least active part of the brain during our dreams is our frontal lobes, which are responsible for higher order functioning and thought. This might explain why our dreams are often not very logical.""

When we can look beyond the content and explore the meaning underlying our dreams we can use them as a fascinating portal towards self-exploration. When we can look beyond the content and explore the meaning underlying our dreams we can use them as a fascinating portal towards self-exploration.

As for how our daily reality impacts our dream's subject matter, Dr. Harold Jonas, a psychotherapist practicing in Florida, says that though we try to operate within the scope of what we know as ""normal"" in our waking hours, once we hit the dream world anything goes. ""During the day we have restrictions on thoughts and impulses,"" Jonas explains. ""The majority of us try to 'do the right thing' and stay within the behavior patterns recognized as the societal norm. But at night— everything changes. The brain may focus on a particular thought it had during the day — no matter how fleeting — and it potentially becomes a focal point for a dream."" And according to Jones, these instances can really run the gamut. ""Did you pass a movie poster of your favorite actor? Did a co-worker's hand brush yours reaching for a report, did something act as a trigger? Couple that with real life events, such as feeling stressed out by your spouse, not being valued at work or any real world daytime trigger, and you’re apt to start having physical, psychological and even chemical reasons for having sexual dreams which you may feel are with inappropriate people.""

Aside from the dream world offering us a literal escape from the day-to-day restrictions we place on ourselves, Marsden says that sex dreams in particular actually occur more often when we're feeling confident.

""Interestingly, we are more likely to have positive sexual dreams when we are feeling good about ourselves or when we are in a general good mood,"" she explains. ""Dreaming, in general, reflects the person's waking states, concerns, worries, desires, etc. Our dreams reflect how we are feeling. Our brain also has a way of using our dreams to act out scenarios that are unlikely or unrealistic in our day-to-day lives. An individual who desires someone who is 'off limits' may experience sexual dreams about that person because it’s the brain’s way of experimenting with the idea without actually following through with it.""

What Those Racy Dreams Really Mean

In terms of the most frequently reported star of these dreams, the boss scenario tops the list.

""Many experts say dreams about having sex with your boss are the most common — and sometimes the most disturbing,"" Jonas says. ""After a racy dream you wake up in the morning and have to go to that staff meeting like nothing happened.""

Often people symbolize other people in a dream, and it is really more about the emotions that you are experiencing. Often people symbolize other people in a dream, and it is really more about the emotions that you are experiencing.

However, this doesn't necessarily mean you're pining after your superior — more likely, it's the power that he or she symbolizes that you crave. ""Before you go thinking that you may subconsciously be secretly sexually attracted to your boss, realize that a sex dream about your boss has more to do with how you view yourself. It’s a dream about your own emerging power, professional abilities and leadership skills. You may be feeling ready to take charge and move your job to the next level compared to where you are now professionally.""

What does it mean when the tables are turned, and you're the one in the position of authority, seducing your intern or friend's younger sibling? Marsden says the answer lies in the context of the dream. “Focus on what was happening in the dream,” she says. “Were you teaching them and guiding them throughout the sexual acts in the dream? Most likely, this is our desire to be dominant in bed with someone we would feel comfortable with, someone we know.""

Another common dream scenario that can be troubling is the one where we're getting it on with our friend's significant other. But clinical psychologist Dr. Alexis Conason points out that what might be lurking underneath the meaning of this one is actually not an attraction you've worked to bury, but rather, a symbol of something else that might be happening in the relationship between you and your friend.

""Often people symbolize other people in a dream, and it is really more about the emotions that you are experiencing in the dream,"" Conason explains. ""So a dream about having sex with your best friend's husband may have more to do with a general sense of guilt that you are experiencing about another situation, boundary violations or competition.""

What about if the object of your affection is that best friend, not his or her significant other? Marsden says that because we spend so much time with our close friends, it's not surprising that they might show up in our dreams this way — no matter how bizarre it can be to experience this. ""Most likely, because we spend a lot time with our friends, it is not uncommon to have sexual dreams about them,"" she says. ""It is our brain’s way of trying it out. If we’ve ever consciously considered what it would be like, we are more likely to actually have the dream. However, sometimes the dreams do come out of nowhere — but that doesn’t mean that your unconscious mind didn’t consider the possibility!""

Using Your Unconscious Mind to Your Advantage

So what can we do, if anything, to try and put a stop to the dreams that are making things awkward in our waking hours?

Dreams are our mind's way of working to resolve conflicts and issues that we aren't able to resolve in our waking hours. Dreams are our mind's way of working to resolve conflicts and issues that we aren't able to resolve in our waking hours.

Marsden says that taking a hard look at the person who's showing up in your dream and what they symbolize will help bring insight. ""Examine why you think you might be having these dreams in the first place,” she says. “What is drawing you to that person? If you are dreaming about someone else and currently in a romantic relationship, take a hard look at your current romantic relationship. What is missing? What is it about this other person that your current partner might be lacking?""

Conason agrees that digging deeper into the ""why"" behind the dream scenario you're dealing with can help. ""Dreams are our mind's way of working to resolve conflicts and issues that we aren't able to resolve in our waking hours,"" she explains. ""The best way to stop having unwanted recurring dreams is to accept the dreams, try to view them as important communications from yourself and work towards understanding what they are trying to tell you. Working to resolve conflicts during our waking hours lessens our need to work through them in our sleep. When we can look beyond the manifest content of our dreams (the superficial who, what and where of our dreams) and explore the meaning underlying our dreams we can use our dreams as a fascinating portal towards self-exploration."""

His son, William ""Billy"" John Kimmel, appeared fine when he was born on April 21. But a nurse noticed the baby had heart murmur and appeared purple in color.

84,http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/legal-battle-behind-trump-tower-meeting-n785776,nbcnews,The Legal Battle Behind the Trump Tower Meeting,['Ken Dilanian'],"WASHINGTON — As Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya tells it, she met with Donald Trump Jr. and other Trump aides in New York last summer to press her case against a widely accepted account of Russian malfeasance, one that underpins a set of sanctions against Russians.

It's a cause Veselnitskaya has been pursuing for years. So, too, has Rinat Akhmetshin, the colorful Russian-born American lobbyist she brought with her to Trump Tower.

Trump Jr., who agreed to the June 2016 meeting at the request of a Russian business associate with a promise of dirt on Hillary Clinton, has said he didn't find much to interest him in the presentation. And little wonder: The subject is a dense and tangled web, hinging on a complex case that led Congress to pass what is known as the Magnitsky Act. The law imposed sanctions on individual Russians accused of human rights violations. It has nothing to do with Clinton.

The Trump Tower meeting has become the latest flashpoint in the ongoing investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia's election interference. The topic of the meeting, many observers have said, is almost beside the point.

But the substance of what the pair of Russian advocates say they came to discuss has a fascinating backstory.

It's an epic international dispute — one that has pitted the grandson of a former American Communist who made a fortune as a capitalist in Russia against a Russian leader who pines for the glory days of his country's Communist past.

In a cinematic twist, one person on the side advocated by Vladimir Putin, Veselnitskaya and Akhmetshin is a former American newspaper reporter turned investigator named Glenn Simpson. He is the same Glenn Simpson whose firm, Fusion GPS, helped craft the controversial dossier alleging that the Trump campaign colluded with Russian intelligence.

Related: Former Soviet Counterintelligence Officer at Meeting With Trump Jr. and Russian Lawyer

That dossier, published by Buzzfeed, made other, more salacious allegations about Trump, and FBI Director James Comey briefed the Republican about it before he took office. The dossier is not favorable to Putin and the Russian government.

Simpson's role on both sides of the Putin divide is set to be explored in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Wednesday examining the Justice Department's requirements for foreign lobbying disclosures.

Due to testify at the hearing is Simpson's longtime opponent in the Magnitsky dispute, William Browder, an American-born hedge-fund investor who made millions investing in post-Soviet Russia and gave up his U.S. citizenship in 1997.

Related: Russian Lawyer Veselnitskaya Says She Didn't Give Trump Jr. Info On Hillary Clinton

Simpson's lawyer said he would defy a subpoena to appear Wednesday because he was on vacation, and that he would decline to answer questions anyway, citing his right against self-incrimination.

Browder, whose grandfather Earl led the American Communist Party, accuses Simpson of peddling falsehoods as an agent of the Russian government. The law firm Simpson worked with on the case accused Browder in court papers of perpetrating a web of lies. Both men dispute the allegations.

The Death of Sergei Magnitsky

The story begins with the November 2009 death of Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian tax accountant who was working for Browder, and who later died in prison.

Browder's account of Magnitsky's death triggered international outrage.

According to Browder, Magnitsky was a lawyer who had been investigating a theft of $230 million in tax rebates paid to Browder's companies in Russia. Browder says his companies had been taken over illegally and without his knowledge by corrupt Russian officials.

Browder says Magnitsky was arrested as a reprisal by those same corrupt officials, and then was tortured and beaten to death. Browder presented documents suggesting that some officials who benefited from the alleged fraud purchased property abroad.

That account led Congress to pass the so-called Magnitsky Act in 2012, imposing sanctions on the Russian officials who were alleged to have violated Magnitsky's human rights.

The Russian government soon imposed a ban on American adoptions of Russian children, ostensibly for other reasons but done in response, many experts say, to the Magnitsky sanctions.

Forty-four Russians are currently on the Magnitsky sanctions list maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department, meaning their U.S. assets are frozen and they are not allowed to travel to the U.S.

Once a Putin supporter, Browder became one of the Russian leader's most ardent foes, spearheading a campaign to draw international attention to the Magnitsky case. He and his employees at Hermitage Capital Management presented information to governments, international bodies and major news organizations.

Browder's advocacy marks a shift from 2004, when, as one of Russia's leading foreign investors, he praised Putin so vigorously that he was labeled Putin's ""chief cheerleader"" by an analyst in a Washington Post article. Browder has said that Magnitsky's death spurred him to reexamine his view of Putin.

The State Department, lawmakers of both parties and the Western news media have described the Magnitsky case in a way that tracks closely with Browder's account. Browder's assertions are consistent with the West's understanding of the Putin government — an authoritarian regime that has been widely and credibly accused of murdering journalists and political opponents.

In 2013, the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office sued a Russian company, accusing it of laundering some of the proceeds of the fraud Magnitsky allegedly uncovered. The complaint incorporated Browder's account about what happened to Magnitsky.

That lawsuit set in motion a process through which that version of events would come under challenge.

The defendant, a company called Prevezon, is owned by Denis Katsyv, who became wealthy while his father was vice governor and transport minister for the Moscow region, according to published reports. The father, Pyotr Katsyv, is now vice president of the state-run Russian Railways. Veselnitskaya has long represented the family.

Prevezon hired a law firm, BakerHostetler, and a team that included a longtime New York prosecutor, John Moscow. Also working on Prevezon's behalf were Simpson, Veselnitskaya and Akhmetshin.

Simpson, a former investigative reporter for the Wall Street Journal, declined to comment.

Simpson also worked with former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele in the creation of the dossier that asserts Trump collusion with Russian election interference. A source close to him said his work on the dossier was kept confidential from his other clients.

The federal civil lawsuit by the Manhattan U.S. attorney against Prevezon was the first opportunity for the U.S. government to publicly present whatever evidence it had to support its legal assertions regarding Magnitsky. It was also an opportunity for the defendants to conduct their own investigation.

Prevezon's American legal team alleged that Browder's story was full of holes — and that the U.S. and other governments had relied on Browder's version without checking it. Browder and the U.S. government disagreed.

The chief American investigator, Todd Hyman of the Department of Homeland Security, testified in a deposition that much of the evidence in the government's complaint came from Browder and his associates. He also said the government had been unable to independently investigate some of Browder's claims.

In court documents, Prevezon's lawyers alleged that Magnitsky was jailed not because he was a truth-seeker — but because he was helping Browder's companies in tax evasion.

The Prevezon attorneys charged that Browder ""lied,"" and ""manipulated"" evidence to cover up his own tax fraud.

The story was ""contrived and skillfully sold by William F. Browder to politicians here and abroad to thwart his arrest for a tax fraud conviction in Russia,"" says a 2015 federal court filing by one of Prevezon's lawyers, Mark Cymrot of BakerHostetler.

A Russian-born filmmaker named Andrei Nekrasov made a similar set of arguments in a docudrama released last year. Neither Prevezon nor the Russian government had a role in funding or making the film, both parties say, though Veselnitskaya and Akhmetshin helped promote it.

Nekrasov, who has a history of making films critical of Putin, says it was funded by Arte, a French and German television channel, and the Finnish and Norwegian film institutes, among other European entities.

Nekrasov says he set out to make a documentary celebrating Magnitsky and Browder, which he says explains why Browder granted him interviews. But he reversed course. His film accuses Browder of misstating the contents of Russian court documents.

""Magnitsky didn't expose any crimes,"" Nekrasov told NBC News. ""The police did not imprison Magnitsky to make him withdraw some accusations. And they did not murder him.""

'Calculated and Callous'

In a sworn deposition, and in written statements to NBC News, Browder vehemently disputed his critics.

He called their allegations ""a calculated and callous attempt to harm and discredit me,"" and ""an offensive lie motivated by the desire of accused Russian money launderers to avoid facing justice in the U.S.""

In July 2016, Browder filed a complaint with the U.S. Justice Department, alleging that Prevezon and Simpson were engaged in an illegal lobbying campaign in violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. It's unclear whether the complaint has prompted enforcement action.

Browder also campaigned against the Nekrasov film, even as Veselnitskaya was lobbying on its behalf. A showing that had been scheduled before the European Parliament was cancelled at the last minute after Browder's lawyers threatened legal action. Ultimately, the film was shown at the Newseum, a museum of the news media in downtown Washington. A handful of activists hooted and jeered.

BakerHostetler was disqualified from the case in October 2016 because attorney John Moscow had originally represented Browder's investment company for nine months, creating what an appeals court deemed a conflict of interest. Prevezon got new lawyers.

But the dispute never got to trial.

Prevezon settled the lawsuit in May — with no admission of wrongdoing — by agreeing to pay $6 million. The U.S. government originally sought to freeze $20 million of company assets. Both sides claimed victory.

Thus, the competing claims were never adjudicated — and they remain difficult to sort through. They hinge on interpretations of various Russian court and police records from many years ago, a span of time and language that can cloud the picture for Western observers.

The judge in the federal case did rule this year, however, that a well-publicized 2013 report on the Magnitsky case, by the Council of Europe, was ""unreliable"" because it didn't fairly examine both sides.

""One of the events that may have colored the investigation from the outset is William Browder's interference with the assembly's work,"" the judge, William H. Pauley III, said during a May 3, 2017 hearing.

One aspect of the case that has been examined independently is Browder's contention that Magnitsky was beaten with rubber batons just before his death by eight guards for more than an hour.

For example, Browder said on MSNBC on February 5, 2015: ""Eight riot guards with rubber batons beat him for an hour and 18 minutes until he died.""

The lawyers and the filmmaker argue there is little evidence to support that.

It's an important point, because Browder's contention is that Magnitsky was murdered to silence him. Those challenging Browder say Magnitsky died of medical neglect under circumstances sadly typical of a Russian jail.

In an email to NBC News, Browder cited as evidence Magnitsky's death certificate, which mentions a ""closed (head) injury,"" followed by a question mark. But an English translation of the certificate (posted on the web by Browder) lists the cause of death as ""toxic shock syndrome and acute cardiovascular collapse."" It adds, ""No signs of a violent death detected.""

Two Russian organizations examined Magnitsky's treatment in prison.

A December 2009 report by Russia's Public Oversight Commission for Human Rights — a Russian non-governmental organization that monitors human rights conditions in detention facilities — makes no mention of beatings, and says Magnitsky died after a lack of medical attention exacerbated by harsh jail conditions.

A second report in 2011, by the Presidential Council for Human Rights, titled ""Preliminary Conclusion of the working group on the study of circumstances of Sergey Magnitsky's death,"" says he was deprived of medical care, and that ""there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the death was triggered by beating.""

However, the head of the presidential council's working group, Kirill Kabanov, said in a 2015 court affidavit that he no longer stands by that and other conclusions in the report, which he said were preliminary. In a sworn affidavit given to Prevezon's lawyers and filed in U.S. district court, Kabanov said some of the report's conclusions were ""copied verbatim"" from documents submitted by Browder and his associates.

In a telephone interview last year with NBC News, Kabanov said, ""The results of official forensic expertise that used original biological materials showed no evidence of beatings.""

Click Here to Read the Affidavit

Asked to respond, Browder said Kabanov's current remarks ""are in direct contradiction to the 2011 Presidential Human Rights Council Report"" and other evidence, which Browder says prove that Magnitsky was severely beaten.

""The fact that Kabanov by 2015-2016 has completely changed his mind and gone as far as to recant his own written and public statements from 2011 destroys his credibility to make any comments on this case,"" Browder said in an email.

In 2010, Browder asked the U.S. group Physicians for Human Rights to examine all the available medical evidence in Magnitsky's death, including the photos that Browder says prove Magnitsky was beaten to death.

The resulting 2011 reportcites evidence of medical neglect and inhumane prison conditions, but it does not mention beating.

In an interview with NBC News, Dr. Robert Bux, the El Paso County, Colorado coroner who led the review, said the available information suggested Magnitsky died of a septic shock — an infection.

Bux said that while he could not rule out that Magnitsky had been beaten at some point, he did not see evidence that Magnitsky was beaten to death.

""We didn't have everything"" investigators would like to have to reach a conclusion, he said, but ""I didn't have anything that substantiates that claim. In the limited photos that I saw, I didn't see any evidence of that.""

In an email, Browder pointed to photos of Magnitsky's body, showing bruises on his hands and left knee. And he noted that Magnitsky's mother, Natalia Magnitskaya, has asked the Russian government to investigate what she believes was a murder.

""The evidence is overwhelming"" that Magnitsky was beaten to death, Browder said on July 14 on MSNBC. ""We have pictures of his beaten body, we have doctors' reports from their own Kremlin doctors."""

They’ve built a prototype that generates a few drops of perspiration — enough to measure blood sugar and to monitor other bodily functions.

Researchers at Stanford University say they've taken a big step to wearable health tech with a wristband device that can measure blood sugar and other important measures of health in a few drops of sweat. Sam Emaminejad / Stanford University

It’s not ready for the market yet, but shows it is possible for people to wear lightweight devices that can deliver on the promise of pain-free diagnosis.

“You don’t stick people with anything. You can just wrap it on people’s hands and have them engage in their daily activities and you can continuously monitor them,” said Sam Emaminejad, who helped work on the device while at Stanford University.

Many groups are working to develop wearable health tech, from the glucose-sensing contact lens that Google currently has put on hold, to a so-called artificial pancreas that is really a series of linked devices that monitor blood sugar and deliver insulin as needed for diabetes patients.

Related: New Wearable Tech Could Help Blind People See

What a wearable health device needs is enough bodily fluids to measure something, such as blood sugar, sodium or hormones. The time-honored method is a needle, and anywhere from a drop to a few vials of blood.

Non-invasive alternatives would have to use sweat.

There are several problems with that, number one being whether you can measure blood sugar or look for, say hormones, in sweat. Second is getting enough sweat to measure in the first place.

The Stanford team thinks they have done that.

Related: FDA Approves First 'Artificial Pancreas'

They’ve put together sweat-stimulating compounds into a small device that delivers a low current. It can measure glucose, sodium and other compounds in the sweat and wirelessly relay that information.

“This platform extracts sweat (at a high secretion rate) on demand or periodically and performs sweat analysis in situ (in place),” they wrote in their report, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

It was not painful and could be worn strapped to the arm. “It could be like a watch,” Emaminejad, who’s now at UCLA, told NBC News.

For proof of principle, the team measured blood sugar and minerals associated with flareups of cystic fibrosis in their volunteers. Such a device might be useful for monitoring a patient’s response to drugs, they said.

“One way I think this technology can be incorporated into our daily lives is to be incorporated into a smartwatch,” Emaminejad said. The compounds that stimulate sweating and that measure the desired compounds would need regular refreshing.

“We need a clever solution. Do we need a disposable cartridge that we can insert easily?” he asked.

And researchers will have to work on better ways to correlate measurements of blood sugar, lactase, potassium and other compounds taken from sweat to what doctors know they mean when measured in blood.

That’s one of the hiccups that held up work on the blood sugar-sensing contact lens — a lack of data on whether measurements in tears were as accurate as measurements taken from blood."

Here’s What the Evidence Shows,['Maggie Fox'],"There’s no strong evidence that anything prevents Alzheimer’s disease, but a few common-sense practices may help delay memory loss, a panel of experts said Thursday.

They include controlling high blood pressure, regular exercise and specific memory training exercises.

Outside of that, there’s no miracle cure and no surefire way to delay the loss of brain power that comes with aging, or the onset of dementia, the committee at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine concluded.

More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer’s, and this number is expected to grow as the population ages. There’s no cure, and treatments do not work well. Drugs such as Aricept, known also as donezepil, and Namenda can reduce symptoms for a time but they do not slow the worsening of the disease.

Related: Researchers Seek Test to Predict Alzheimer's

Researchers have some hints that drugs can reduce the brain-clogging plaques that are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s but they have not shown conclusively that the drugs can help symptoms or prevent disease. Such drugs are also years away from getting on the market.

“The strongest evidence was in the area of cognitive training.”

But there is evidence that some lifestyle changes might reduce the risk, or at least delay the onset of dementia.

The committee of experts looked at all the best research on ways to prevent memory loss and what’s called cognitive impairment — the loss of the ability to think clearly and make decisions.

Despite the explosion of online and commercial products — from supplements to memory games — that allege they can help, there’s very little out there that can be proven to slow or prevent the decline, the experts reluctantly concluded.

“At present, there are no pharmacologic or lifestyle interventions that will prevent mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease,” said Dr. Ronald Petersen, an Alzheimer’s expert at the Mayo Clinic, who was on the committee.

“All this is not new, but this review is the strongest evidence base we have,” Petersen added.

“We have all been exposed to a study here, a study there. One suggests this intervention is beneficial, the other finds it’s not. This review looked at the totality of literature over last six years and put it to the most rigorous test you can imagine.”

There are three rays of hope: cognitive training, blood pressure control and exercise.

“Even though clinical trials have not conclusively supported the three interventions discussed in our report, the evidence is strong enough to suggest the public should at least have access to these results to help inform their decisions about how they can invest their time and resources to maintain brain health with aging,” said Dr. Alan Leshner, chair of the committee and CEO emeritus of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

“The strongest evidence was in the area of cognitive training,” Petersen said.

This doesn’t mean crossword puzzles or Sudoku, although those won’t hurt, Petersen cautioned. The best evidence came from a study looking at specialized training.

Related: Alzheimer's Deaths up 55 Percent

“This was a study that looked at specific training of groups of people on, for example, memory improvement techniques, mnemonic techniques as they're called,” Petersen told NBC News.

“How can I improve my memory? Can I organize material that will help me remember material at a later point in time? Can I use certain strategies that will help me process information more quickly and more efficiently that may benefit me later on down the road?”

People will have to work at it, Petersen said. “Can you, in fact, find a new way to try to remember a list of grocery items?” Peterson asked. Instead of using a smartphone calculator to figure out a tip, do it in your head, he advised.

Commercial products have not proven they help, Petersen cautioned.

“We’re very concerned about the brain game industry taking this and running with it, and say NAS has shown that cognitive training is going to forestall cognitive decline, and we have our brain game here,” he said.

Most have done little more than show they make people better at playing those particular games, Petersen noted.

Controlling blood pressure is something people should do anyway, to prevent heart disease. But good evidence shows it can reduce the risk of memory loss and dementia, probably because high blood pressure damages delicate blood vessels in the brain.

And several studies have shown that exercise can help.

“Here we're talking about modest aerobic exercise,” Petersen said. That includes brisk walking.

“How much? Maybe 150 minutes a week — 30 minutes five times, 50 minutes three times — can have an effect on reducing cognitive impairment later in life,” Petersen said.

“Try to avoid the tendency to sit down, watch television for endless hours at night. Get out there, do something.”

“Is it going to prevent Alzheimer's disease? I can't say that. But I think it may have an effect on reducing cognitive impairment.”

None of the evidence is strong enough to justify a public education campaign, the committee of experts concluded.

“We’re all urgently seeking ways to prevent dementia and cognitive decline with age,” said Dr. Richard Hodes, director of the National Institute on Aging.

“But we must consider the strength of evidence — or lack thereof — in making decisions about personal and public investments in prevention.”

Peterson said people can make everyday changes in their lives to keep their brains clearer.

“Try to avoid the tendency to sit down, watch television for endless hours at night. Get out there, do something,” he advised.

There’s no cure for Alzheimer’s and no long-term medical treatment that has been shown to reduce symptoms. But people who think they have symptoms should see a doctor as soon as possible, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. People need to plan their futures, and some conditions, such as vitamin deficiency, look like dementia but are easily corrected."

In many of the homes, he felt like he was an outcast and not treated as a member of the family, he said. A few times, he shoplifted from malls and grocery stores because his foster families didn’t provide him with a large enough allowance, he added.

It wasn’t until he was matched with Spencer Sun through Sun’s involvement with the nonprofit Chinatown Service Center that Wilson Sun felt he had found a parent that truly cared for him. Wilson Sun ended up living with his former foster parent through college and, after receiving a full scholarship to study accounting, changed his name to ""Sun"" when he got married.

“To be a parent or foster parent you have to have a lot of perseverance and patience because at the end of the day you’re going to see both the good and ugly of the foster kids too,” Sun, now 27, told NBC News. “[Spencer Sun] was the first parent that I felt was genuine that provided unconditional love and it was truly sincere. Spencer has done so much for me. He was the one who pushed me to want more in life.”

“Many of these Chinese kids are new immigrants, so it’s even more traumatic that they are placed in non-Chinese speaking homes, or non-Asian foster homes.”

Nonprofits in Los Angeles are looking for more Asian-American foster parents like Spencer Sun to serve the county's foster children with a particular focus on language ability and cultural understanding.

More than 18,000 children in LA County are in foster care, according to Neil Zanville, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services. Of those children, approximately 1.8 percent is Asian American and Pacific Islander, Zanville noted.

But despite that, the number of Asian-American foster families is limited, according to LA-based nonprofit Korean American Family Services (KFAM), which recruits and trains foster families among providing other services.

“In our mind, it might not be a large percentage, but 600 to 800 [Asian-American and Pacific Islander] foster kids is a good number of kids who could really benefit from having a family that understands their cultural needs,” KFAM executive director Connie Chung Joe told NBC News.

Three years ago, the organization struggled to find even one licensed foster care parent of Korean descent in Los Angeles and Orange Counties after meeting with community members who were concerned that kids were being put in households that struggled with language and cultural barriers.

“When we asked around, there were none in the Cambodian, Chinese, or other communities, either,” Chung Joe said.

Karen Lim, program director at Special Service for Groups’ Asian Pacific Counseling and Treatment Centers (APCTC), a nonprofit which partners with KFAM, noted that there are a significant number of Chinese kids who are removed from their homes due to alleged abuse and neglect , but very few Chinese-speaking families who can take them in.

“Many of these Chinese kids are new immigrants, so it’s even more traumatic that they are placed in non-Chinese speaking homes, or non-Asian foster homes,” Lim told NBC News.

“To be a parent or foster parent you have to have a lot of perseverance and patience because at the end of the day you’re going to see both the good and ugly of the foster kids too.”

The lack of licensed Asian-American foster care parents and common misconceptions about the process to become one prompted KFAM to begin recruiting efforts.

In January 2014, the organization launched the Korean Foster Family Initiative. In December 2015, KFAM expanded its recruiting efforts into the Chinese community, partnering with APCTC and Chinatown Service Center, and rebranded the program as the Asian American Foster Family Initiative.

In December 2016, KFAM became a licensed foster family agency, allowing the organization to train and directly approve and certify foster families, Chung Joe said.

Since 2014, KFAM has been able to recruit 39 foster parents of Korean descent, according to Chung Joe, and the organization’s first group of foster families of Chinese descent is approaching approval.

The initiative’s current focus is finding potential Filipino foster parents, as they comprise the largest population of Asian-American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) foster kids in LA County, Chung Joe said.

“We’ve also been in discussion with Cambodian and South Asian [community-based organizations] who are asking if they can partner with us to expand into their communities,” she added.

On July 30, the Asian American Foster Family Initiative is scheduled host an information session, “How to Become a Resource/Foster Parent,” which is expected to include testimonies from Spencer and Wilson Sun.

“There’s not that many Asian-Americans that will come out to speak, let alone have a story similar to mine’s where despite everything, you pulled through and have a happy ending which is not common in foster care families,” Wilson Sun said. “Despite losing parents, you will find someone that truly loves you.”

Spencer Sun told NBC News that his faith played a role in deciding to become a foster care parent and in the AAPI community, conversations about safety and security are heavily emphasized, which may serve as an impediment to fostering.

Sun received initial pushback from his own parents and family when taking on the role as a foster care parent, he noted.

“I think they thought it was too risky and didn’t know what’s going to happen when you bring a strange kid into your home and you don’t know their background,” Sun said.

Sun added that, while foster parents being the same racial or ethnic group as foster children may help the transition go a bit easier, the ultimate goal is to find foster children a loving home after being removed from a traumatic environment.

“I just think that the kids can discern whether the foster parents genuinely care for them or not and so that would trump ethnicity and race,” Sun said.

But his co-opting of global pop hit ""Despacito"" on live TV has drawn a sharp and public slap-down from its popular Puerto Rican singers, Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee.

The left-wing leader was seen clapping along to a version of the song with lyrics altered to encourage Venezuelans to vote for a Constituent Assembly — a proposed new body that will have powers to rewrite the national charter and supersede other institutions.

As the song begins to play, Maduro can be seen telling the audience “lets see if it goes viral.” Afterwards, he asks: ""What do you think, eh? Is this video approved?""

Yet the political remix was far from popular with the original artists.

“At no time I have been consulted or have I authorized the use or change of Despacito lyrics for political ends, less so in the context of the deplorable situation affecting a country that I love so much as #Venezuela,” Luis Fonsi wrote in a post to his 4.5 million followers on Instagram.

“My music is for all of those that want to listen to it and enjoy it, not to use it as propaganda that tries to manipulate the will of the people that are crying out for their freedom and a better future,” he added.

Daddy Yankee used his Instagram account, which has 16.5 million followers, to post an image of Maduro with a red cross drawn over the top of it. ""With this nefarious marketing plan, you only highlight your fascist ideal,"" he wrote in the text that accompanied the image.

Erika Ender, who co-wrote the song, also commented on the photo-sharing site, saying she did not agree with the way it had been used. “I love Venezuela, a land that has given me true brothers in my heart. Brothers who suffer because of the situation that exists,” she said.

Despacito, which translates from Spanish as “slowly” and contains raunchy lyrics including “I want to undress you with my kisses, slowly,” is the most popular song in the history of YouTube having been viewed more than 2.7 billion times.

A remix featuring Justin Bieber was released earlier this year and it was last week announced as the most streamed song of all time by Universal.

However, it’s sexually explicit theme has led to it being banned on public radio stations in Malaysia after politicians there described it as “obscene.”

The version played on Venezuelan TV contained less exciting lyrics, including: ""It is the call to the constituent that only wants to unite the country.""

She claimed that since she didn't have a basket, she dropped the items in a shopping bag and thought she told the cashier about them.

The police report tells a different story. It says a security officer at Walmart watched Payne pile items from the pharmacy department in her purse and then transfer other items from her shopping cart to her purse and a shopping bag.

The guard nabbed her as she left the store and the items — which totaled $86.22 — were returned to the store. Payne was taken to the City of Chamblee Jail, booked on a shoplifting charge and released.

Despite her past exploits, chronicled in a Netflix documentary, Payne insisted she didn't mean to steal anything from Walmart.

""I have a money card with $7,000 on it,"" she said, adding that she is in the midst of negotiating a book deal and a movie deal.

Payne's attorney, Drew Findling, said it doesn't make sense that Payne would steal a bunch of necessities from the big-box store, which ""is a far cry from what historically people associate with Doris Payne.""

""There's no brooch, no diamond pendant, no earrings. She was at Walmart,"" he said. ""This doesn't fit into anything she has done before and we are going to look at the video and see what's going on, see if this is maybe forgetfulness.""

Payne was on probation for stealing a $2,000 necklace from a department store jewelry counter. The judge made her wear an ankle monitor and ordered her to stay out retail stores.

Findling said it's possible Payne could face prison time because of the Walmart episode.

""At her age, that would be tragic,"" he said. ""At my office, we're treating this like her life is on the line."""

Over the past few weeks, it's become famous as the home of the ""trio"" or the ""three gay husbands"" as locals now call Colombia’s first legally recognized polyamorous couple.

""Are you here to chat to the trio?"" a resident asks. ""We've seen a lot of foreigners over the past few weeks,"" a middle-aged woman adds. She says she's happy the three men are able to be themselves but doesn’t support polyamorous relationships, explaining, ""I believe marriage is something between a man and a woman.""

(L-R) Alejandro Rodriguez, Victor Hugo Prada and Manuel Bermudez are planning to hold a public wedding ceremony in Medellin, Colombia. Dimitri O'Donnell

Medellín was once famous as the home of drug lord Pablo Escobar, but these days it's better known for its vibrant arts and culture scene, lively nightlife and for having what is thought to be the world’s first legally recognized ""throuple"" — the term that describes a three-person relationship.

Manuel Bermudez, Alejandro Rodriguez and Victor Hugo Prada won a legal battle to formalize their ""special patrimonial union"" in June.

""Welcome to our little home!"" Prada, 23, says as he opens the door. On the second floor, an immaculately kept open-plan living area leads on to a terrace with impressive views overlooking Colombia’s second city. It's a calm and peaceful space with lots of homegrown herbs and plants. The walls are full of mainly gay-themed art. The most striking is a modern, sexed-up version of a muscle-bound St. Sebastian.

""We’re very artistic people,"" Prada, an aspiring actor, explains. He guides the reporter upstairs where a king-size bed dominates another open-plan space. ""All three of us sleep here, perfectly, with no problems,"" he says. ""It’s can be cold at night in Medellin so we sleep huddled together. It’s really nice!""

For Bermudez, Rodriguez and Prada, there’s nothing unusual about their domestic arrangement. ""We spend a lot of time together, but we also lead independent lives outside of the home,"" Prada explains. ""We don’t have specific roles or rules. Whoever gets up last makes the bed. Alejandro and I like to cook, and Manuel takes care of other things.""

Since their union was made public, Bermudez, Prada and Rodriguez have been at the center of an intense national debate about polyamorous relationships. ""It's been really crazy. The whole world seems interested in us, and it can be very intrusive,"" Rodriguez, a dancer and sports instructor, says.

Many people are curious about how they live and how a ""throuple"" works. ""I tell them we’re just normal professionals. We lead a quiet life in Medellín. This relationship is real and not for show. We’ve been together for a long time, and it works well,"" Rodriguez said.

The third member of this ""diverse family,"" as they call themselves, is journalist Manuel Bermudez. The youngest of 15 boys, Bermudez describes his early life as privileged. ""Nothing ever happened to me. I was never bullied at home for being gay. My family accepted me as I was,"" he said.

Bermudez and Rodriguez have been together for 18 years. They took on the state in 2000 fighting for legal recognition for their partnership and won. It would be another 16 years before Colombia legalized same-sex marriage. ""We wanted to show that gay couples can also be in a stable, permanent and loving relationship,"" Bermudez explained.

Eight years into their relationship, Bermudez and Rodriguez met Alex Zabala. All three lived together as a throuple until Alex died from stomach cancer in 2014.

Four years ago, Prada became the fourth member. He met them when he was just 18. ""Our main motivation is to honor the memory of Alex, and we believe he’s still with us in spirit,"" Rodriguez explained. ""He changed our lives for the better and has been with us all the way in this process for official recognition.""

Gay rights activist and lawyer German Rincon-Perfetti drew up the documents that define what the union represents. The trio were not granted a marriage, but the union has been given recognition and guaranteed legal protections. ""Colombia’s constitutional court wants to be seen as progressive, guaranteeing human rights and is keen to treat every citizen as equal,"" Rincon-Perfetti told NBC News.

He described the victory as ""historic"" and praised Colombia as the first country in the world to back such a union. The ruling is expected to have implications for those who do not fit the definition of what constitutes a traditional family unit.

""There’s single mothers, grandparents and aunts and uncles taking care of children that will benefit. Other polyamorous heterosexual couples will now be able to come out and live openly and honestly,"" Rincon-Perfetti said.

Bermudez, Prada and Rodriguez, however, don’t consider themselves trailblazers. ""We’re quiet people, and I know this sounds selfish, but we set out on this journey for ourselves and Alex and not to be part of some big campaign,"" Rodriguez says.

Shortly after they went public, they received messages of support from other polyamorous families around the world. ""They’ve congratulated us for bringing attention to the reality of what it means to be part of a loving polyamorous relationship,"" Bermudez says. ""The fear factor is preventing a lot of other throuples from coming out. They want everyone to know that love has no boundaries, and you can have a normal functioning relationship with three or four people.""

Since their landmark victory, the three men have been criticized by conservative groups. They’ve received death threats online but don’t take them seriously. ""It’s horrible to read some of the stuff on social media"" Bermudez says. ""But in real life the reaction has been fantastic. When we’re out in public old women and students tell us: ""Wow! How brilliant and brave we are, its something really special for us.""

Prado recently told his two partners he would like to be a father at some stage. Colombia’s same-sex couples can legally adopt under a progressive law passed in 2015. Bermudez and Rodriguez were surprised. ""I’ve never imagined myself as a dad. It was never part of my life plan,"" Rodriguez admits. ""But we’re part of this special polyamorous relationship, and we support each other. If the time comes when Victor decides he’s ready for a child, we’ll be beside him with our full support.""

There’s palpable excitement when talk turns to the ""wedding."" ""Its going to be in public in a place where anyone can come along,"" Rodriguez tells NBC News. The ceremony, he says, will be theatrical in tone with a lot of dance and spiritual elements. It will also pay tribute to the life of Alex Zabala and will end with a three-way kiss to seal the deal.

""We’re already getting wedding gifts,"" beams Prada, as he takes out a framed pencil sketch of himself, Rodriguez and Bermudez. They’re sitting in a pink car with big, broad smiles. The words ""Just Married"" splashed across the front and the number plate reads ""la trieja"" (the trio).

When jokingly asked if they feel like they're living a bride and groom fairy tale cliché, Prada says with a laugh, ""We're better than that."" He adds, ""We’re already living our 'happily ever after.""

97,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-takes-aim-support-historically-black-colleges,msnbc,Trump takes aim at support for historically black colleges,[],"In late February, Donald Trump signed an executive order intended to signal support for historically black colleges and universities. The Republican president, who hosted a widely seen photo-op in the Oval Office with HBCU officials, said at the time that these institutions of higher learning would be “an absolute priority for this White House.”Trump added at the time, “I am thrilled to be signing an executive order to recognize the importance of historically black colleges and universities – very important. They have played such an important role in achieving progress for African Americans in our nation’s march for justice.”As it turns out, the White House is saying something quite different now. Politico reported over the weekend:

A Washington Post report added, “People in higher education circles worried that the statement meant that the president was planning to get rid of a capital financing program that helps historically black colleges repair, renovate and build new facilities.”The Post’s report added that Trump intends to treat the financing program “in a manner consistent with the (constitutional) requirement to afford equal protection of the laws.”In fairness, no one knows exactly what that’s intended to mean.Indeed, there’s some ambiguities surrounding the administration’s position. Trump, who obviously doesn’t keep up on policy details or the substance of any area, pointed to the Historically Black College and University Capital Financing Program – a program that helps these school receive low-cost construction loans – as potentially problematic, but no one can say what that means in practical terms, or what the White House intends to do next.Derek W. Black, a law professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law who studies constitutional and education law, told Politico the signing statement is “ rather odd .” The professor added, “If Congress is validly spending money on these programs, and there’s no court finding or litigation suggesting discrimination, the idea that the executive would unilaterally not allocate those funds would be a rather momentous position to take.”It’d also be the exact opposite of what Trump told officials from these schools as recently as late February.As a candidate, the Republican billionaire routinely told largely white audiences, “Look at how much African-American communities are suffering from Democratic control. To those I say the following: what do you have to lose by trying something new like Trump? What do you have to lose?”As it turns out, they have quite a bit to lose."
98,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/devos-picking-schools-should-be-picking-uber-lyft-or-taxis,msnbc,"DeVos: Picking schools should be like picking Uber, Lyft, or taxis",[],"“How many of you got here today in an Uber, or Lyft, or another ridesharing service? Did you choose that because it was more convenient than hoping a taxi would drive by? … Just as the traditional taxi system revolted against ridesharing, so too does the education establishment feel threatened by the rise of school choice. In both cases, the entrenched status quo has resisted models that empower individuals. “Nobody mandates that you take an Uber over a taxi, nor should they. But if you think ridesharing is the best option for you, the government shouldn’t get in your way. “The truth is that in practice, people like having more options. They like being able to choose between Uber Pool, Uber X, Lyft Line, Lyft Plus, and many others. Or when it comes to taking a family trip, many like options such as Airbnb. “We celebrate the benefits of choices in transportation and lodging. But doesn’t that pale in comparison to the importance of educating the future of our country? Why do we not allow parents to exercise that same right to choice [sic] in the education of their child?”

Taken at face value, I imagine many at the Brookings Institution event probably found this quite compelling. If you don’t stop to think about it, giving people a “choice” sounds like an inherent good that should be applied broadly, even to education.So let’s take a minute to explain why DeVos’ rhetoric is fundamentally flawed.The idea that families don’t have educational choices is, by and large, plainly wrong. Nationwide, parents can send their child or children to a public school, for a free quality education. In much of the country, if parents prefer, they can also choose between private, parochial, or charter schools. If none of those are appealing, many families home-school their kids.But wait, DeVos would probably say, those varied options may exist in theory, but in practice, many Americans can’t afford private education. That’s true. It’s also where her ridesharing analogy starts to break down.For many low-income Americans who can’t afford a car, “choices in transportation” don’t really exist. Those folks can walk, bike, or take a bus. Taxis and ridesharing may sound nice, but for those who struggle economically, they’re not a realistic “choice.”DeVos, as best as I can tell, isn’t recommending taxpayer-funded vouchers to help those Americans subsidize their taxi and/or ridesharing choices, motivated by some kind of hostility towards municipal bus networks. She simply assumes that people with more resources will have greater transportation options than people with fewer resources – just as the wealthy have more choices in housing, health care, nutrition, technology, clothing, recreation, and many other aspects of modern American life.If the Education Secretary were calling for governments to invest taxpayer money into taxis and ridesharing, so that those who rely on buses and bikes can take better advantage of their “choices in transportation,” we’d be having a different kind of conversation. But DeVos, like many on the right, wants to give low-income Americans taxpayer money to choose privatized education – and just privatized education.OK, so maybe DeVos’ vision is overly myopic. But so what? Why not treat education and transportation as comparable service commodities?The answer is that the two have very little in common. If you want to turn to taxis and ridesharing to get to where you’re going, you pay a fare. It’s a business venture that relies on profit. If you want to turn to a school to educate you child or children, it’s a very different model, at least if you rely on the public-education system, which doesn’t even try to turn a profit because the kids don’t pay tuition.Even private schools operate in fundamentally different ways. Imagine, before you could take advantage of a ridesharing service, you had to pass an entrance exam. Or had to profess certain religious beliefs. Or faced discrimination based on your sexual orientation. That would be absurd, of course, with Uber or Lyft, but in private education, parochial schools have operated this way for decades.Making matters slightly worse, in DeVos’ model, even if your child or children can pass the exams and meet the private school’s related standards, the voucher DeVos would hand you may not cover the full cost of tuition – which means you’d be headed back to the public school system that would suddenly have many of its best students taken away as a result of the privatization/choice scheme.Other than all of these flaws and all of the actual evidence, though, the Education Secretary’s analogy makes perfect sense."

105,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/why-its-unwise-trump-target-alaskas-lisa-murkowski,msnbc,Why it’s unwise for Trump to target Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski,[],"At a White House event yesterday afternoon, Donald Trump acknowledged that his party had cleared a procedural hurdle as part of its health care crusade. The president’s Republican Party, however, was not unified in the endeavor.

“So we had two Republicans that went against us, which is very sad, I think,” Trump said. “It’s very, very sad – for them.”

This morning, the president kept it going, this time singling out Sen. Lisa Murkowksi (R) of Alaska with an angry tweet:

“Senator @lisamurkowski of the Great State of Alaska really let the Republicans, and our country, down yesterday. Too bad!”

First, the idea that Murkwoski let down the entire country by standing up for health care benefits is plainly bonkers.

Second, it’s not at all clear why Trump is singling out the Alaska Republican for a very public rebuke. Murkowski wasn’t the only GOP senator to vote against the procedural measure yesterday afternoon, and she was one of nine GOP senators to break ranks on a “repeal and replace” measure last night.

But even putting that aside, Trump’s tweet was strategically unwise if he’s serious about reaching his own goals.

In a narrowly divided Senate, Republican leaders have no real margin for error if they’re going to pass a regressive health care bill. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) already appears to oppose her party’s entire initiative and wants to start anew with a less ridiculous approach. Other GOP skeptics abound.

It’s against this backdrop that Donald Trump effectively said, “I know what to do! While the process is still ongoing, I’ll accuse Lisa Murkowski of a partisan and national betrayal!”

This will almost certainly push the Alaskan even further away, which is the opposite of what GOP leaders wanted to see. Trump could be reaching out to Murkowski right now, trying to negotiate with her, or perhaps even selling her on the merits of his ideas. But he doesn’t know how to do any of that, so he’s trying Twitter abuse instead.

Postscript: Sen. John McCain told Murkowski yesterday she did “the right thing.”"

Yesterday, DeVos was on Capitol Hill, testifying at a House Appropriations subcommittee, where the education secretary was eager to defend Donald Trump’s budget request for directing taxpayer money to private and parochial schools. Most of the hearing went about as one might expect, but an exchange between DeVos and Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) was of particular interest, because it focused on the voucher movement’s Achilles’ heel: taxpayer-subsidized discrimination.



Slate had Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is having an interesting week. On Monday, for example, the Republican opponent of public education argued that “defenders of current system” of education are “ flat-earthers .” I don’t think she was kidding.Yesterday, DeVos was on Capitol Hill, testifying at a House Appropriations subcommittee, where the education secretary was eager to defend Donald Trump’s budget request for directing taxpayer money to private and parochial schools. Most of the hearing went about as one might expect, but an exchange between DeVos and Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) was of particular interest, because it focused on the voucher movement’s Achilles’ heel: taxpayer-subsidized discrimination.Slate had a good piece on what transpired:

Clark used Bloomington, Indiana’s Lighthouse Christian Academy as an example. The school currently gets more than $665,000 in state funding through a school voucher program, Clark said. It also openly reserves the right to deny admittance to any student in a family where there is “homosexual or bisexual activity” or family members who practice “alternate gender identity.” If Indiana applies for federal funding for schools like these, Clark asked DeVos, would her Department of Education require them to stop discriminating against LGBTQ students and families?



DeVos didn’t say yes or no. She just smiled and stuck to the generations-old cover for violent oppression in America. “The states set up the rules,” she said. “I believe states continue to have flexibility in putting together programs.”"

It was Cantor who helped bring ACA repeal bills to the House floor dozens of times. It was Cantor who helped spearhead “defund Obamacare” campaigns. And it was Cantor, we now know, who didn’t genuinely believe his own nonsense.

The former GOP leader in the House talked to the Washingtonian’s Elaina Plott and conceded that his Republican Party is in a tough spot – parts of the conservative base expect the party to repeal the ACA, because that’s what they were promised – in part because of promises he and his colleagues made that they never intended to keep.

Asked if he feels partly responsible for their current predicament, Cantor is unequivocal. “Oh,” he says, “100 percent.” He goes further: “To give the impression that if Republicans were in control of the House and Senate, that we could do that when Obama was still in office….” His voice trails off and he shakes his head. “I never believed it.” He says he wasn’t the only one aware of the charade: “We sort of all got what was going on, that there was this disconnect in terms of communication, because no one wanted to take the time out in the general public to even think about ‘Wait a minute – that can’t happen.’ ” But, he adds, “if you’ve got that anger working for you, you’re gonna let it be.”

In context, when Cantor says he and his party felt the need to “let it be,” he means that Republicans fed a bunch of nonsense to their own voters, then exploited their anger for electoral gain with no intention of following through.

Cantor and his colleagues, in other words, played their base for fools – because they thought it’d help them win some elections, which it did.

I didn’t really expect the former House Majority Leader to admit that he helped oversee a cynical multi-year charade, but it’s good to see Cantor coming clean now."

115,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/automatic-voter-registration-expands-its-ninth-state,msnbc,Automatic voter registration expands to its ninth state,[],"As recently as early 2015, a grant total of zero states had automatic voter registration. As of yesterday, however, AVR is now the law in nine states.

Gov. Gina Raimondo has signed a bill that allows qualified voters to automatically register. The new law would provide automatic voter registration for eligible citizens when they’re obtaining or renewing a driver’s license, unless the person chooses to opt out…. The bill passed last month in the House and Senate and had bipartisan support. Rhode Island becomes the ninth state to put in place automatic voter registration.

Illinois appears likely to become the 10th state to adopt the policy, with the legislature already having approved AVR and Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) is expected to sign it. What’s more, the issue will be on the statewide ballot in Nevada next year, and the consensus is it’s likely to pass.

Circling back to our previous coverage, this is a policy that’s tough to argue against. When it comes to registering to vote in the United States, the burden has traditionally been on the individual: if you’re eligible to vote, it’s up to you to take the proactive steps needed to register.

Automatic voter registration, which already exists in many of the world’s democracies, flips that model. The idea is exactly what it sounds like: states would automatically register eligible voters, shifting the burden away from the individual. Those who want to withdraw from the system can do so voluntarily without penalty, but otherwise, Americans would be added to the voters rolls automatically.

At the federal level, Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) has taken the lead on sponsoring a national AVR bill, and his proposal has 108 co-sponsors. At this point, however, literally all 108 are Democrats. In a House led by a far-right Republican majority, the bill has no realistic chance of getting a vote, at least in this Congress.

That said, the scale of the Democratic supports suggests the next time control of Capitol Hill changes hands, we may see some real movement on this."

Our last map, back in July, showed Clinton with a 255-190 advantage — so Clinton’s tally has gone up since the conventions, while Trump’s has declined.



The significant changes in our map:



- We’ve moved Colorado, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Nebraska’s one electoral vote from Tossup to Lean Dem.

- We’ve also moved Florida from Lean Dem to Tossup.

- Georgia moves from Lean GOP to Tossup.

- And we’ve changed Kansas and South Carolina from Likely GOP to Lean GOP.

So, in about three hours, GOP lawmakers are likely to pass an unpopular health bill that cuts taxes on the wealthy while undermining schools for special-needs children.At a certain point, congressional Republicans stop looking like American policymakers and start looking like villains from a Dickens novel.The New York Times spoke to Vickie Glenn, a Medicaid coordinator for a special-education program in Illinois, who said , “If I could have 10 minutes with President Trump, I could help him understand what we do, why it’s important. If he understood, he would protect it, because this isn’t Republicans and Democrats. It’s just kids.”Who knows, that might make a difference. The last person to speak to Donald Trump often convinces him, just so long as no one else gets his ear.But Vickie Glenn won’t get that chance, at least not before House Republicans pass their depraved legislation this afternoon.You might be wondering why we’re just hearing about something like this now. Indeed, the Times’ report coincides with a Wall Street Journal piece , which we discussed earlier, about the realization that the GOP bill may also undermine private-employer-based insurance in ways that haven’t been talked about, either.The explanation for this has everything to do with how House Republicans are choosing to legislate. Ordinarily, concerns such as these would be raised over the course of months, as policymakers hold hearings, receive testimony from subject-matter experts, consult with industry stakeholders, and scrutinize the projected impact of their proposals. They even have the opportunity – get this – to improve bills before voting on them as they learn of unintended consequences.But not in this case. Republicans are rushing the bill onto the floor without hearings, without testimony, without debate, without scrutiny, and without so much as a CBO score.And so we’re seeing stories like these about hurting special-needs kids the day of the vote. We’re likely to learn even more tomorrow and in the coming days – after the bill passes the House."

140,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/its-not-enough-john-mccain-say-the-right-things,msnbc,It’s not enough for John McCain to say the right things,[],"It was a dramatic moment on Capitol Hill yesterday when Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), recently diagnosed with brain cancer, arrived on the Senate floor. Without the veteran lawmaker, Republicans would not have been able to advance their effort to take health care benefits from millions of Americans.

Soon after casting his vote with his party, McCain delivered prepared remarks on his concerns about contemporary politics and what’s become of the legislative process, and much of the media, which has long gushed over the Arizona senator, could hardly contain its praise. Here, for example, was CNN’s report:

In a Washington moment for the ages, Sen. John McCain claimed the role of an aging lion to try to save the Senate, composing a moving political aria for the chamber and the country that he loves. With a deep-red scar etched from his eyebrow to his temple, the legacy of brain surgery less than two weeks ago, McCain beseeched his colleagues to forsake political tribalism and restore the chamber to a spirit of compromise that had helped forge national greatness.

Roll Call published a related piece, telling readers, “Years from now, when the history of the modern Congress is written, John McCain’s address to the Senate on July 25, 2017, is likely to stand among the defining summations of the era.”

I realize that the political media has its favorites, and for a variety of reasons, McCain has long been a media darling. I’m also aware of the unique circumstances: a man who’s devoted much of his life to public service, including heroic military service, is facing a serious health crisis. Those who want to celebrate McCain’s work feel an added incentive to do so quickly and vigorously.

But the adulation paints an incomplete – and to a very real extent, misleading – picture for the public. One can respect McCain’s lifetime of sacrifices while still acknowledging the glaring gap between the senator’s words and his actions.

In isolation, McCain’s speech was, to be sure, a powerful rebuke to institutional breakdowns in the Senate. He made a compelling case for a more constructive and more deliberative legislative process, and he did so while holding both parties to account, which all but guarantees reverence from much of the Beltway press.

The remarks did not, however, arrive in a vacuum. McCain had just cast a partisan vote in support of an indefensible health care process, which intends to end with a bill that does not currently exist. The senator sang the praises of “regular order” in the Senate after casting a vote that ensured there would be no regular order on this issue.

McCain simultaneously condemned and protected a process he apparently opposes and supports. He expressed severe disappointment in his colleagues trying to pass major legislation without hearings or deliberations, and then rewarded those who’ve disappointed him, ensuring their victory.

The senator proceeded to announce his opposition to his party’s latest proposal, which he then voted to support just six hours later.

If McCain’s speech “stands among the defining summations of the era” in future history books, let’s hope the chapter also acknowledges the profound contradiction between his words and deeds – which, in a crushing sense, really did make this “a Washington moment for the ages.”"

146,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-raises-corruption-allegations-against-fbis-mccabe,msnbc,Trump raises corruption allegations against FBI’s McCabe,[],"Donald Trump first expressed his dissatisfaction with acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe last week in an interview with the New York Times. Yesterday, the president went considerably further, publishing a tweet suggesting McCabe is corrupt.

“Problem is that the acting head of the FBI & the person in charge of the Hillary investigation, Andrew McCabe, got $700,000 from H for wife!”

This morning, in a pair of tweets, Trump kept going.

“Why didn’t A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation but got big dollars ($700,000) for his wife’s political run from Hillary Clinton and her representatives. Drain the Swamp!”

I can appreciate how easy it is to grow inured to the bizarre circumstances we find ourselves in, but when a sitting president accuses the acting director of the FBI of corruption, without credible proof, that’s pretty extraordinary.

It’s also baseless. Two years ago, McCabe’s wife ran for office in Virginia, and like several other competitive candidates, she received campaign support from Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D). Jill McCabe’s candidacy nevertheless came up short.

Months later, Andrew McCabe helped oversee the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server protocols, which found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing.

In Trump’s mind, Terry McAuliffe and Hillary Clinton are the same person, and there was some mysterious conspiracy that doesn’t make any sense. (McAuliffe wasn’t in a position to know in 2015 what case McCabe might work on in 2016).

But in the larger context, the president whining about the acting FBI director isn’t about McCabe; it’s about Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whom Trump apparently believes he can force out of office through rude tweets. Indeed, this morning’s missives were ostensibly about McCabe – a popular target in conservative media of late – but note that the president started by asking rhetorically why Sessions didn’t replace McCabe.

I assume tweets like these will continue indefinitely until Sessions quits?"

He was succeeded by Ernest Moniz, who led the physics department at MIT.

In the Trump administration, things are a little … different.

Energy Secretary Rick Perry told CNBC on Monday he does not believe carbon dioxide emissions from human activity are the main driver of climate change, joining the EPA administrator in casting doubt on the conclusion of some of the government’s top scientists. Asked whether CO2 emissions are primarily responsible for climate change, Perry told CNBC’s “Squawk Box”: “No, most likely the primary control knob is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in.”

Close video California set to leave Trump behind on climate policy Governor Jerry Brown talks about California’s aggressive climate action policy, the deals his state is considering with Canada, Mexico, and China, and why Donald Trump is wrong on the Paris climate accord. share tweet email save Embed

In an apparent attempt to drive the reality-based community batty, Perry added that his skepticism towards climate data is a sign of a “wise, intellectually engaged person.”

It’s not just the cabinet secretary’s rejection of climate science that rankles; it’s also Perry’s explanation. He not only fails to accept the effects of carbon pollution, Perry believes climate change is the result of oceans “and this environment.”

What does that mean? I have no idea, but just as importantly, there’s no reason to believe Perry has any idea, either.

This reminded me of a New York Times piece from a couple of weeks ago, which I’ve been meaning to mention:

The campaign ad appeared during the presidential contest of 2008. Rapid-fire images of belching smokestacks and melting ice sheets were followed by a soothing narrator who praised a candidate who had stood up to President George W. Bush and “sounded the alarm on global warming.” It was not made for a Democrat, but for Senator John McCain, who had just secured the Republican nomination. It is difficult to reconcile the Republican Party of 2008 with the party of 2017, whose leader, President Trump, has called global warming a hoax, reversed environmental policies that Mr. McCain advocated on his run for the White House, and this past week announced that he would take the nation out of the Paris climate accord, which was to bind the globe in an effort to halt the planet’s warming.

In the Obama era, denying climate science became part of what it means to be a Republican. The more evidence emerged, pointing to a global crisis, the more GOP officials, candidates, and pundits announced their preference for dangerous, willful ignorance.

Several years ago, Mother Jones’ Kevin Drum wrote a memorable item about the trajectory of climate denial:

1. The world isn’t warming. 2. OK, it’s warming, but it’s not man-made. It’s just natural climate variability. 3. Fine, people are responsible. But it’s not economically worth it to do anything about it.

As Perry’s on-air comments to CNBC reminded us, contemporary Republicans have regressed, finding themselves split between numbers 1 and 2.

History’s judgment will be brutal."

155,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-intellectual-debate-rick-perry-says-he-wants-already-over,msnbc,The ‘intellectual’ debate Rick Perry says he wants is already over,[],"Last week, Energy Secretary Rick Perry told CNBC he considers his skepticism towards climate data to be a sign of a “wise, intellectually engaged person.” Yesterday, at a press briefing at the White House – it’s apparently supposed to be “Energy Week” – Perry used similar phrasing, calling for “an intellectual conversation” on global warming.

“Can we agree we ought to have a conversation as a people?” the Republican cabinet secretary asked. “Intellectually engaged, not screaming at each other, and not standing up in the middle of my speeches and saying you’re a climate denier, when the fact is, I just want to have a conversation about this.”

At face value, this may sound perfectly defensible. All Perry says he wants is a free exchange of ideas, with people of good faith sharing evidence as part of an open, deliberative process. Who’s prepared to take a stand against reasoned discourse and polite discussions? If Perry wants a conversation, why not engage in one?

The answer, as The New Republic’s Emily Atkin explained very well, is that Perry’s posture is a sham.

Make no mistake: When Perry says he just wants an “intellectual conversation” about how much carbon dioxide impacts the climate, that is a lie. Or, in the most generous interpretation, it’s a misunderstanding of what an “intellectual conversation” really is. Any intellectual person accepts that the scientific method is among society’s most reliable tools for determining facts. And climatologists have overwhelmingly determined, by use of the scientific method, that carbon dioxide emissions are the primary cause of current climate change. Perry is unwilling to accept the scientific method. Therefore, an intellectual conversation is not what he wants. What Perry does seem to want is further delay any actual intellectual conversation about climate change: a conversation that focuses on how best to solve it.

Quite right. Wise, intellectually engaged people have already wrapped up the conversation Rick Perry says he’s eager to have. They’ve now moved on to different conversations about solutions, stop-gaps, consequences, and points of no return.

If Rick Perry wants to get up to speed and participate in those discussions, I’m sure he could find some scientists who’d donate their time and help him understand the issues about which he’s still confused.

But let’s not mistake cynicism with curiosity. Perry keeps using that word, “intellectual,” but I don’t think it means that he thinks it means."

157,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-campaigns-pittsburgh-not-paris-rally-draws-dozens,msnbc,"Trump campaign’s ‘Pittsburgh, not Paris’ rally draws ‘dozens’",[],"In his White House speech on Thursday afternoon, Donald Trump delivered a soundbite that conservatives quickly embraced: “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.” The phrase, which drew quick applause from the president’s supporters, did not, however, make any sense: the international climate accord was agreed to in Paris, but it was intended to benefit everyone, not just Parisians.

Nevertheless, this Politico report, published the day after Trump’s speech, didn’t come as too big a surprise to anyone.

President Donald Trump’s campaign announced a “Pittsburgh, not Paris” rally across from the White House on Saturday to celebrate the United States’ withdrawal from a global climate agreement. The Fairfax County Republican Committee and the Republican Party of Virginia are sponsoring the rally in Lafayette Square, which is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. Saturday, according to an announcement from the Trump campaign.

It was hard not to appreciate the irony of Republicans holding a “Pittsburgh, not Paris” rally in Lafayette Square – literally across the street from the north side of the White House – which is named after a French general, Marquis de Lafayette, who helped America win the Revolutionary War. New York magazine’s Jon Chait noted, “There is literally no stupider location in the entire world to stage an anti-French American rally.”

And while that may be true, that doesn’t necessarily mean turnout for such a gathering would be poor. After all, if a sitting president’s campaign team announces support for a rally in a major American city, and the event is officially sponsored by a nearby state Republican Party, it stands to reason that plenty of GOP diehards would come out to express their support for Trump’s anti-climate decision.

So, how many people showed up?

BuzzFeed, which published some pictures from the rally, wrote that “dozens of Trump supporters” gathered for the event. The Washington Post similarly reported that “dozens” showed up to applaud the president’s decision to withdraw from the international agreement.

Hmm. The population of Washington, D.C, is nearly 700,000, but the greater D.C. area has over 6 million residents. Fairfax County, Va., near the nation’s capital, itself has over 1 million people. Trump World and its Republican allies managed to get “dozens” of people to express support for the president’s big decision?

That’s pretty sad – though I’ll look forward to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer telling reporters today that this was the largest turnout for any event in the history of Lafayette Square … ever.

Postscript: The Washington Post’s report added, “More than a thousand people gathered near the Washington Monument Saturday to rally at the March for Truth, calling for an independent investigation into alleged collusion between Russia and President Trump’s 2016 campaign.”

So on the one hand, we saw an event endorsed by the sitting president’s campaign operation, which drew “dozens” of people, while on the other hand, we saw a separate event – in the same city, on the same day, at nearly the same time – that wasn’t sponsored by any campaign, which drew “more than a thousand” attendees.

I’m starting to get the impression that one side of the political divide has a definite advantage when it comes to grassroots activism and enthusiasm.

Postscript: Reader B.G. reminds me of an “Arrested Development” episode that seems especially relevant to this story."

Only nine states appear to either explicitly allow ballot selfies or have no currently enforceable state law clearly forbidding it.

172,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/strike-two-senate-republicans-fail-again-aca-repeal-vote,msnbc,Strike Two: Senate Republicans fail again on ACA repeal vote,[],"Senate Republicans voted last night on Mitch McConnell’s latest health care proposal, which needed 60 votes to advance, but managed to receive just 43. This afternoon brought us Strike Two.

The Senate rejected a proposal Wednesday that would have repealed major parts of the Affordable Care Act and provided a two-year delay for lawmakers to develop a substitute, indicating that in the immediate future Republicans can only muster a majority for modest changes to the current law. In two separate votes over the course of less than 24 hours, lawmakers have rejected different approaches to rewriting the landmark 2010 law known as Obamacare.

Today’s measure, the “Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act,” commonly known as “repeal and delay,” needed 50 votes, but ended up with 45. In all, seven Senate Republicans – Collins, Heller, Murkowski, Alexander, Capito, McCain, and Portman – broke ranks and opposed the legislation, which garnered 55 “no” votes.

And as a matter of public policy and public health, that’s an encouraging development. This bill, which passed the Senate in 2015 when Republicans knew their vote was largely for show, would have repealed the Affordable Care Act in the short term, and then set a two-year deadline for Congress to figure something out. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office recently found that this bill would push 32 million Americans into the ranks of the uninsured over the next decade, include 17 million Americans just within the next year.

In fact, before we move on, let’s pause to note how amazing these circumstances are. We’re talking about a bill that would take coverage from 32 million people, repealing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with nothing, and 45 Republican senators voluntarily said, “Yep, that sounds good to me.”

They knew it wouldn’t pass, but these GOP senators wanted to be on record voting in support of this dangerous, regressive, and unpopular legislation anyway. Indeed, in a bit of a surprise, today’s bill received two more Republican votes than yesterday’s bill – which was itself depraved.

Nevertheless, we’ve now discovered that there aren’t 50 votes to “repeal and delay” or for “repeal and replace.”

The Senate is now moving toward the “vote-a-rama” phase in the process, in which senators consider a lengthy series of amendments. That’s expected to begin in earnest tomorrow.

In the meantime, GOP leaders continue to work on a final Republican bill – the sort of thing senators traditionally do before the process begins, not during the process itself – that McConnell & Co. hope can get 50 votes.

If all goes according to plan, and I use the word “plan” loosely, that vote should happen by the end of the week."

177,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-bans-transgender-americans-military-service,msnbc,Trump bans transgender Americans from military service,[],"The Obama era was a period of great social progress in the United States military. The Democratic administration ended the ban on gay and lesbian soldiers serving openly; the Pentagon made women eligible for combat roles; the Secretary of the Army was an openly gay man; and the administration ended the ban on transgender Americans serving in uniform.

On that last point, then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced in June 2016 that transgender service members are “talented and trained Americans who are serving their country with honor and distinction.”

Donald Trump apparently doesn’t care.

President Donald Trump announced a ban on transgender military service in a series of tweets Wednesday morning. “After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow…… Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming….. victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you,” Trump wrote in a trio of tweets Wednesday morning.

There was an odd point in last year’s presidential campaign, shortly after the Orlando nightclub massacre, in which Trump insisted that LGBT voters, en masse, should move to the right and vote Republican. Trump, in apparent seriousness, said he, not Hillary Clinton, would be the “better friend” of the “LBGT” [sic] community. Just two days after the Orlando shooting, Trump added, “Thank you to the LGBT community! I will fight for you.”

Anthony Scaramucci, a Trump advisor and surrogate who now serves as the White House’s communications director, declared earlier this year that Trump “is most pro-LGBTQ rights [president] in history. Why’s that story not written in mainstream media?”

That was before Trump decided to undermine the rights of transgender kids in public schools, which came before today’s tweets banning transgender Americans from serving in the U.S. military.

What’s not at all clear is what Trump and his Republican administration intend to do with the transgender Americans who are already serving in uniform. Remember, Barack Obama’s policy didn’t open the door to transgender troops; transgender troops were already there. Obama simply allowed these soldiers to come out and share their gender identity with their colleagues and commanding officers.

Trump, however, says he will not “accept or allow” transgender Americans “to serve in any capacity.” While we wait for further guidance from the military, it would appear this means a whole lot of dishonorable discharges are on the way, because our confused amateur president says so.

After Trump’s announcement, a Trump administration official told an Axios reporter, “This forces Democrats in Rust Belt states like Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin, to take complete ownership of this issue.”

It’s almost as if the White House is unconcerned with civil rights or military recommendations, and is solely interested in partisan political considerations."

The study, released Thursday by the Education Department’s research division, follows several other recent studies of state-funded vouchers in Louisiana, Indiana and Ohio that suggested negative effects on student achievement.

It leaves the Trump administration in an awkward position. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who was nominated and confirmed despite her opposition to public education and ignorance about education policy, is one of the nation’s leading advocates of privatizing schools through voucher schemes. It’s a crusade she continues to pursue with great vigor.The more the evidence mounts against the idea, the more Team Trump is left to argue that they want a policy that plainly doesn’t work.And before conservatives argue that this D.C. study is only one report, consider that there’s ample evidence pointing in the same direction. The New York Times reported in February, “[E]ven as school choice is poised to go national, a wave of new research has emerged suggesting that private school vouchers may harm students who receive them. The results are startling – the worst in the history of the field, researchers say…. It’s rare to see efforts to improve test scores having the opposite result.”For federal policymakers, the question is simple: does real-world evidence matter more than ideological goals or not?Postscript: Just as an aside, note that the Obama administration considered scrapping the D.C. voucher system, but then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) made a direct appeal to the Democratic president, saying it was personally important to him that the voucher program continue. Obama, trying to be conciliatory, agreed to leave it alone."

And last night, Republicans suffered an important defeat – the first of several.

With Vice President Mike Pence casting a tie-breaking vote, Republicans moved forward on health care reform Tuesday as the Senate successfully opening debate on the issue. But just six hours later, Republicans faced their first defeat in that process, failing to pass a measure that they’ve been working on that would have partially repealed and replaced Obamacare.

At issue was the latest iteration of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) bill – the Better Care Reconciliation Act (or BCRA) – which has been in the works for over a month. The measure needed 60 votes, but failed to even get 50: as the roll call shows, the final tally was 43 to 57, with nine Republicans voting with Senate Democrats against the measure.

It wasn’t, in other words, particularly close.

The Senate then broke for the night, with plans to vote this afternoon on an even-more-radical “repeal and delay” plan that would gut the Affordable Care Act and figure out what to do about it two years later. That will need 50 votes, and by all accounts, the measure will fall short.

And therein lies the point: for all of yesterday’s excitement, Republicans still don’t have a realistic plan to achieve their goals. GOP senators climbed to the top of the diving platform, jumped off, and hope to figure out what they’re doing before they reach the water.

For much of the country, this is understandably terrifying, because there’s so much uncertainty. No one can say with any confidence what Republicans will do, whether they’ll have the votes to do it, and just how many Americans will suffer if they succeed.

Nevertheless, we’re left with a dynamic in which GOP senators are no closer to solving the puzzle than they were a day ago, a week ago, or a month ago."
195,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-announcement-transgender-troops-surprises-pentagon,msnbc,Trump announcement on transgender troops surprises Pentagon,[],"Ordinarily, when pundits talk about the White House’s communications problems, they’re referring to Donald Trump and his team struggling to stick to an honest and consistent message. But this morning we were reminded of a different kind of White House communications problem.

The Pentagon seems to have been unaware that President Donald Trump has decided to bar transgender people from the military. A Pentagon spokesman, Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, refused to answer questions about what Trump’s tweeted announcement means for the current policy, including whether transgender people already serving in the military will be kicked out. “Call the White House,” he said.

It looks like the president just banned thousands of transgender troops without coordinating with the Defense Department. The White House also didn’t offer the Senate Armed Services Committee a heads-up, either.

And I don’t imagine anyone finds this is especially surprising. Trump picked a new FBI director without coordinating with the Justice Department. Trump makes foreign policy decisions without running them by the State Department. When Trump launched his Muslim ban, the Department of Homeland Security wasn’t at all clear on how to implement the president’s vision.

The president sees himself as a CEO, which is a flawed model for the head of a federal executive branch, but it’s especially problematic given that Trump looks at his administration as a small business instead of a large one.

As a candidate, Trump sold himself to voters as the head of a big and successful private-sector enterprise, but what went largely overlooked was the fact that the Trump Organization has always been a modest operation.

Mr. Trump often boasts of the size of the Trump Organization. “It’s a big company,” he said in the interview last spring. A spokeswoman said the business employed “tens of thousands.” But industry experts estimate that no more than 4,000 people work for the Trump Organization worldwide. And executives say that the three floors that make up the headquarters appear to have no more than 150 employees. It is a family business, as everyone involved is quick to explain.

It’s not as if Trump ran a major American company like General Electric, with hundreds of thousands of employees and multiple divisions, tackling a variety of complex operations. Rather, he oversaw a more modest company, with a small workforce, which left him plenty of time to become a television personality.

So when Trump makes important decisions about American troops, it doesn’t occur to him to coordinate with the relevant policymakers – in part because the president doesn’t know how government works and in part because he’s not accustomed to thinking in any other way."
196,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/refrigeration-not-essential-for-all-perishable-foods/,cbsnews,Foods you should never put in the refrigerator,[],"Refrigerators can help plenty of foods last longer, but many people don't know that not every perishable needs to be kept in the cold.

Chef Rachel Reuben of Food Fix Kitchen makes her living teaching others how to cook. Reuben says one of the most important lessons she provides involves guidance on which foods need to be refrigerated, especially when it comes to produce.

""I think we assume everything will do better in the refrigerator but that's not really true,"" Reuben told CBS News.

Knowing what food should and shouldn't be left to chill can ensure that what you eat maintains its quality, she explains.

While the cold can prevent many fruits and vegetables from going bad, that doesn't mean they'll taste as good or will be as healthy. ""They will lose nutrients and flavor in the refrigerator,"" Reuben said.

In the fridge, tomatoes lose their texture and potatoes can become gritty. Reuben believes other foods like apples, onions, avocados and citrus fruits are better when kept at room temperature. Bananas should never be refrigerated because they turn black faster, she says.

Berries can also be kept out of the fridge but should be eaten quickly, which is why Reuben recommends buying them in smaller quantities.

Many people refrigerate bread because there's a widespread belief that it will reduce mold growth. However, Reuben says that cold bread tends to dry out.

Reuben also pointed out one item most people don't refrigerate but probably should: nuts. Though it's safe to keep nuts in the pantry, Reuben says they will actually taste better and last longer if you store them in the fridge. They also contain oil, which can go bad over time.

""If you have a large quantity of nuts that you know you're not going to use for a long period of time, I would definitely keep nuts in the refrigerator,"" she said."

In Ethan's case, one of his major symptoms is the loss of most of his eyesight. His mother planned a family trip to the beach last week in Wildwood, New Jersey, to make sure he would ""see the sea"" in his lifetime.

Little did they know, a New Jersey man named John Lynch had gotten wind of their story through a mutual friend. Lynch started an organization called Lunch with Lynch, which serves at-risk youth in his community.

First, Ethan got to spend a day at the beach as an honorary life guard. He and his family also had a police escort through town. But when Lynch learned from Ethan's mom that his dream was to be a police officer, he organized an even bigger surprise. He called the local police chief, Robert Regalbuto, and asked if he'd meet with Ethan.

Chief Regalbuto offered something better -- to swear Ethan in as an honorary police officer in front of the entire department.

I think my heart has finally burst!!!! When Chief Robert Regalbuto of the Wildwood Police Department heard that Ethan wanted to be a police offer he gave me a direct order!

On July 17th, Ethan's dream came true.

""When he walked up and everyone met him there was a crazy buzz,"" Lynch said. ""It was an incredible vibe, because it's hard to get everyone together ... I don't think I've had a day I was more proud to be an American.""

""I can tell you that we both cried,"" Natalie Kranig told CBS News of the moment her son was sworn in. ""I knew this was the most amazing moment for my son. My heart melts.""

Lunch with Lynch

The video of Ethan's swearing in has since gone viral. For Natalie, who works as an EMT, and her family the outpouring of support comes at a moment when they need it most. Ethan has undergone 29 surgeries as a result of his disease, and the beach vacation was planned in coordination with a trip to Johns Hopkins for a follow up to his latest procedure. But her husband lost his job over a year ago, and the cost of Ethan's mounting medical bills and travel to Baltimore has caused the family home to go into foreclosure, Natalie said. They've set up an online fundraiser to help pay for Ethan's treatments.

""It's a terrible situation to choose between your mortgage payment or your son's vision,"" Natalie said. ""It's hard for me, but he's always been a happy kid. I know these are memories I can refer back to when things get tough.""

To make sure Ethan always has those memories and more, the Lunch with Lynch Foundation set up a drive to send first responder uniform patches to Ethan for his growing collection. He hopes to have a patch from every state one day."
198,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-americans-say-u-s-political-debate-is-increasingly-uncivil/,cbsnews,Poll: Americans say U.S. political debate is increasingly uncivil,[],"By Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus, Kabir Khanna and Anthony Salvanto

Members of Congress are getting positive ratings for the way they responded to the shooting in Alexandria, Virginia, last week. President Trump gets slightly lower -- though still net positive -- evaluations for his response to the attack, partly because Democrats are less likely to approve of his handling than of Congress'. Fifty-three percent of Americans approved of Congress' response, and 29 percent disapproved, while 46 percent approved of President Trump's response, and 36 percent disapproved.

CBS News

And while Congress and many observers called for a more civil tone to political debate in the wake of the events, Americans of all political leanings overwhelmingly say that the tone and level of civility in our political debates has been getting worse in recent years.

CBS News

These views are largely the same across ideologies, too, as about two-thirds of liberals, conservatives and even more moderates feel things have gotten worse.

Three-quarters of Americans feel the current tone of politics and debate is encouraging violence among some people; Democrats are especially likely to say so. About a third of Americans consider the recent shooting of a Congressman and others a terrorist attack.

CBS News

But importantly, Americans draw some distinctions between the political debate they decry, and the people themselves that hold opposing views. Most Republicans do not think of Democrats as threats to their way of life, but merely as people they disagree with on politics. Likewise, most Democrats feel the same about Republicans in this regard. There is a small core in each party, who do see other Americans across the political divide as threats to their way of life -- but they are not the majority.

CBS News

Given this, optimism still prevails, though not by a landslide. More believe that people of different political views are capable of working together than are pessimistic about the prospects.

CBS News

This poll was conducted by telephone June 15-18, 2017 among a random sample of 1,117 adults nationwide. Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Media, PA. Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones.

The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone.

Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables.

The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus four percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly.

The Office of Appeals, which handles about 100,000 tax disputes every year, is introducing a videoconferencing option. Starting Aug. 1, taxpayers will be able to video chat with the IRS from any location that has internet or mobile service through a ""secure, web-based screen-sharing platform,"" the agency said. The software, WebEx, also includes a text chat feature and the ability to share documents.

While IRS Appeals has used video technology previously, it was accessible only from a limited number of locations. Perhaps because of this, it ""has been used infrequently,"" the agency said. It anticipates that the new option, which is being run as a pilot program, will be particularly useful to people living in rural areas or far from IRS officers.

""In the future, the technology may give taxpayers greater options in engaging with Appeals and could allow us the flexibility to serve taxpayers virtually from any location using mobile devices or computers,"" Donna Hansberry, chief of IRS Appeals, said in a press release."
200,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cell-phone-spam-and-scam-calls-are-spreading/,cbsnews,Spam and scam calls are going mobile,['Kathy Kristof'],"Cell phones used to be immune from the annoying scam and spam telemarketing robocalls that have bedeviled land line users for years. No longer.

More than half of cell phone users report having received a scam call in the past month. And repeated scam and spam calls to mobile phones have quadrupled over the past two years, according to a new survey.

Several factors can explain the increase, said Jonathan Sasse, chief marketing officer of First Orion Network Enterprise Solutions, which commissioned the study. More people are using their cell phones as a primary form of contact, thus sharing the numbers on everything from rent applications and resumes to website forms and contests. Some consumers also include their cell phone numbers in email signature lines.

""Once a mobile number is out there, scammers and telemarketers will find a way to call you,"" Sasse added. ""When it comes to scammers, these aren't legitimate companies following the rules. They're after your mobile number however they can get it, even if it means using auto-dialers to try any possible combination of phone numbers to target people.""

Moreover, the cost of random-dialing equipment has dropped ""to practically nothing,"" said John Oldshue, chief executive of SaveOnPhone, a cell phone shopping website. That's allowing offshore telemarketing ""boiler room"" operations to proliferate.

Roughly 80 million unwanted calls are made to cell phones each day. First Orion's latest survey, which polled 1,000 mobile phone users, found that over three-quarters of respondents received a scam call in the past year, a 15 percent increase from the company's previous survey in 2015.

However, 12 percent of consumers reported getting 20 scam calls or more in just the past six months -- a four-fold increase over the 3 percent who reported repeated scam calls in the previous survey.

Unfortunately, old-school solutions to junk calls, such as signing up for the Do Not Call Registry, are ineffective at handling the preponderance of today's scam and spam calling.

""The Do Not Call Registry is only effective in stopping legitimate telemarketers from calling you,"" said Oldshue. ""These guys set up calling centers in Bangladesh. They're not playing by the rules.""

That said, a wealth of services are available that can block the bulk of these calls. Though many charge annual or monthly fees, some caller-ID and blocking services are free. Hiya, for instance, offers a free phone app that provides caller ID and call blocking. Nomorobo provides the same free service for land lines."

The problems forced Niantic Inc., the developer of the wildly popular augmented reality game, to issue a statement saying everyone who registered for the event would get a full refund for the $20 tickets and $100 in credits for use of the app.]

Niantic CEO John Hanke was booed when he took the stage at Chicago's Grant Park to address the thousands of frustrated Pokemon enthusiasts.

Some in attendance had paid as much as $400 online for the tickets, which sold out within minutes of their June release. While no official attendance figures were available, organizers had planned for as many as 20,000 Pokemon players and ""trainers"" at the festival billed by Niantic as the first official anniversary event in the world.

Mark Haberkorn of Chicago, a member of the Official Pokémon Go 40 Club, an international online community of high-level players, said he started waiting in line for the opening of the festival at 6 a.m.

""The excitement has just been drastically minimized because of what we've experienced today,"" Haberkorn told the Chicago Tribune.

""They promised up wifi towers, they promised us all types of things and we come here and we're getting nothing. It's been terrible,"" Bobby Pegram, who drove from Virginia, told CBS Chicago.

One couple told CBS Chicago they spend over $1,000 for plane tickets, a hotel and a babysitter for the weekend.

Late in the day, Niantic's Chief Marketing Officer Mike Quigley tried to placate irritated players by announcing that everyone who scanned a code when they entered the park would automatically receive the Legendary Pokémon Lugia, a rare and powerful creature difficult to defeat in virtual battle and prized by Pokémon enthusiasts.

Niantic says Pokémon Go has been downloaded 750 million times since it was launched. The augmented reality game that uses GPS to locate, capture, battle and train virtual creatures was introduced in the United States in July 2016.

During a private meet and greet arranged by the park, Mickey asked the kids to pose with him, holding up a sign that revealed their May 24 adoption date.

""Adoption..."" Elijah read out loud before gasping.

The siblings broke down into tears.

Courtney Gilmour

""Congratulations! That's awesome,"" Mickey said as he hugged a tearful Janielle.

""They were super surprised. They really thought they were just getting a picture and an autograph of Mickey,"" Courtney said. ""Everyone in our life knew the adoption date beside the kids. They had no idea.""

Courtney posted a 5-minute video of the emotional moment on Facebook last week, and it's now going viral with more than 1.5 million views.

""I've watched it about a million times and I cry every single time,"" Courtney said. ""It's a hard feeling to express, because we know we've given something that the kids desperately wanted. I'm happy, excited, nervous — all those things wrapped into one.""

Courtney Gilmour

Courtney and Tom started the process of becoming foster parents just one month after they got married.

""I was a foster child myself, so I always knew growing up I wanted to be a foster parent,"" Courtney. ""I knew the man I was going to marry had to be willing to be a foster parent.""

Fortunately for Courtney, he was.

Over the past three years, the couple has fostered 13 children, including Janielle and Elijah. The pair always volunteered to take in siblings, usually two at a time.

""I don't believe in breaking up sibling groups,"" Courtney said. ""You're already losing so much as a [foster] kid.""

Most of the kids they took in were younger and considered a ""short term placement."" Janielle and Elijah were different.

""When they came to us they were a little bit older and we were able to instill a bit of a bond,"" Courtney said. ""We spent time with them and clicked very quickly. They were already calling themselves Gilmours in school.""

The brother and sister had been in the foster system — on and off — for most of their lives. Now, after all of these years, Courtney hopes the kids will know what it's truly like to be part of a family.

""Letting the kids be normal is what helps us breathe,"" Courtney said. ""Foster care isn't easy. Even a simple thing such as going to sleepover party becomes this big ordeal, and they get embarrassed. Now they can live a normal life."""
203,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/report-brain-training-games-cognitive-benefits-claims/,cbsnews,Report challenges claims of cognitive benefits of online brain-training games,['Dr. Tara Narula'],"NEW YORK -- Can you keep your mind sharp -- as you age -- by playing so-called brain games?

A report Tuesday by AARP focused on what has become a $1.3 billion business.

Ads for online brain-training games tout their cognitive benefits saying they improve memory, brain speed and attention. But the report called the evidence behind these claims of cognitive benefits ""weak to nonexistent.""

Sarah Lock, executive director of the AARP's Global Council on Brain Health, shed light on the report.

CBS News

""They might get better at the game but what we don't know is how that's going to affect your everyday functioning,"" Lock told CBS News. ""So you might get better at the game but it's not going to help you manage your finances any better.""

Training to improve one type of cognitive ability -- like memory -- doesn't end up improving other skills such as how fast you process information.

And the report says there's often exaggerating when these products are marketed.

Last year, the FTC fined the makers of Luminosity $2 million for claiming its games could help users reduce or delay age-related cognitive impairment.

The good news is that cognitively stimulating activities are easy to find, such as learning a new skill. At the Greenwich House Senior Center, Betty Tiago is taking up art.

""I think anything creative helps to stimulate your brain,"" Tiago said.

CBS News

Other ideas to help improve cognitive benefits are activities that are novel and require focus and have a level of depth and engagement.

Some recommendations from the AARP include:

Educational opportunities (formal or informal including volunteering)

Learn new skill (music or language)

Leisure activities (playing cards, playing with children)

Mentally and physically stimulating activities (tennis and dancing)"
204,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/top-alzheimers-researcher-on-how-you-can-help-protect-you-brain/,cbsnews,Top Alzheimer's researcher explains how you can help protect your brain,['Ashley Welch'],"Every 66 seconds, someone in the United States develops Alzheimer’s disease.

Currently, more than 5 million Americans live with the memory-robbing ailment and by 2050 that number could rise as high as 16 million, according to new figures from the Alzheimer’s Association.

Scientists are working to find ways to not only treat Alzheimer’s but prevent it from developing in the first place. In one key step in the process, researchers are gaining a better understanding of the role of amyloid proteins in the development of the disease.

CBS News

“The amyloid plaques build up outside of the nerve cells [in the brain] and now we know that when the nerve cells interact with the plaque, it causes the nerve cell to make a tangle inside,” explains Rudy Tanzi, Ph.D., director of the Alzheimer’s Genome Project and a leading researcher in the field at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. “And that tangle then chokes the nerve cell from within and kills it. So the killing process begins with the amyloid – that’s kind of the gun – but the tangle’s the bullet, so to speak.”

Experts now believe these amyloid plaques and the tangles they form start occurring in people’s brains 10 to 15 years before any symptoms like memory loss begin to show.

The latest drug development efforts are focused on intervening much earlier on, before the disease takes an irreversible toll on memory and cognitive function. Tanzi likened it to taking statins to manage cholesterol to prevent a future heart attack.

Another increasingly important focus of medical research is neuroinflammation in the brain — why it happens, and how to stop it.

For patients with Alzheimer’s, Tanzi explained, “What’s killing most of your nerve cells is neuroinflammation, where the brain has reacted against all these plaques and tangles and cell death with an inflammatory response. And only over the last 5 years, we’ve discovered the genes that control neuroinflammation in Alzheimer’s and we’re doing drug discovery based on those as well.”

Yet, while such drugs can take years to develop, Tanzi says there are things people can do right now to help protect their brain. He spoke with CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook about these strategies.

Q: Aside from choosing the right parents, what can somebody do to prevent Alzheimer’s – or try to help prevent Alzheimer’s?

A: The four big categories are diet, exercise, sleep and stress reduction. I wrote about this in detail in my last book, “Super Genes” – six chapters, more than you wanted to know about how to adapt your diet to minimize inflammation and plaques.

Meaning Mediterranean diet, probiotics – take care of your gut bacteria.

Q: Which probiotics?

A: Yogurt, a yogurt drink like kefir, or a probiotic pill with live bacteria.

Q: But there’s so many different ones ... which ones? Do we know yet? We don’t know yet.

A: It’s a hot area right now. There are companies that are looking at what are the best bacteria to put in a probiotic.

Q: Why would what’s going on in your gut affect what’s going on in your brain?

A: So it turns out there’s what’s called a gut-brain axis, where the bacteria in your gut are creating chemicals that interact with your brain that do everything from determine your mood to control how much inflammation there is in your brain.

Q: And even obesity, right? It’s amazing what we’re learning about these trillions of bacteria that people were saying, ‘Oh, wash them out … I’m going to get a cleanse. They’re icky! Let’s get them out of us!’ It turns out, of course, millions of years of evolution – they’re there for a reason.

A: And you want to take care of them. They’re there to help you. A Mediterranean diet, more fiber, more fruit, what are called prebiotics, probiotics – meaning, if you don’t know exactly what probiotic pill to take, at least live-culture yogurt. I drink kefir every morning.

And then after diet – exercise. You know at least an hour-long brisk walk, or try to get 8,000 to 10,000 steps if you’re using a device.

And sleep. Eight hours. After 40 years old, you have to get seven to eight hours of sleep, and try your best to do it because as you cycle in and out of REM sleep, this is when you clean amyloid plaque out of your brain.

Q: That was one of the most amazing discoveries, when I first read about that – you’re actually ‘garbage collecting’ at night when you’re asleep. The toxins get carried out of your brain.

A: The brain – first of all, the cells that can cause inflammation, when they’re behaving are clearing the plaque. So you want to keep these certain cells clearing the plaque away and not causing inflammation. During the deep sleep, those cells eat all the plaque. And then the brain literally, physically constricts itself and releases the plaque debris – the proteins from the plaque – into the spinal fluid and out of the brain to wash away.

You can actually see the brain physically constricting after the material’s been broken down by the resident cells. And this only happens during delta – slow-wave – the deepest sleep that comes in after REM. So you want to be able to cycle in and out of REM several times per night. Kind of like a dishwasher on multiple cycles, you want to go in and out to clean the brain as much as you can every night with sleep.

Q: So it’s coming down to what our parents told us, right? Eat your fruits and vegetables, get a lot of exercise, get plenty of sleep. And then the last thing you said was stress reduction.

A: Managing stress. It turns out, we just published a study on meditation, a new trial on how does meditation affect your gene activity – your gene expression, as we call it.

We did it with folks at Mount Sinai [Hospital] in New York. And what we found was that with a meditation practice, there are changes in your gene expression that work against inflammation and that actually create a healthier state. We also see changes in genes that affect the amount of amyloid in your brain during a full one-week intensive meditation course.

So we have meditation instructors, we have novice meditators who are learning, and our control group of people at the same resort who were just hanging out and having fun but not learning how to meditate. And there were significant differences in terms of very beneficial gene expression changes in those who were meditating.

Q: One of the biggest fears my patients have is that they might be developing dementia. So how do you distinguish between a ‘senior moment’ and dementia? I mean, people would kind of flippantly say, if you can’t find your car keys that’s one thing, if you find them and don’t know what they do, that’s another thing. But I always found that a very flip answer. What do you really say to a patient in that situation?

A: Well the fact is, as we get older, we don’t recall names as well, we can see the face of an actor we know but can’t recall the name as fast. There are changes that happen in the brain just as there are changes in the muscles. Our joints, our muscles get a bit weaker. So that’s why it’s so important to work out physically and mentally. You know, stay engaged in learning new things.

Q: Crossword puzzles? Learning a new language?

A: I like to say – if crossword puzzles help you, if it’s the New York Times it would help you between Friday and Sunday, because you’d probably have to look something up and learn something new. But it’s really learning new things. When you learn something new, you make new synapses – connections between nerve cells [in the brain]. And all learning is based on what you already knew, you learn by association to what you already knew. So not only do you make new synapses, but you strengthen the ones you already have."
205,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/charlie-gard-parents-urged-make-end-of-life-plan-great-ormond-street-hospital/,cbsnews,Charlie Gard's parents urged to make end-of-life plan with hospital,[],"LONDON -- Critically ill baby Charlie Gard will be transferred to a hospice to die Thursday unless his parents and a hospital agree on an end-of-life plan that could potentially keep the child alive for a bit longer, a British judge has ruled.

High Court judge Nicholas Francis gave 11-month-old Charlie's parents and the hospital that has been treating him until noon Thursday to come to terms on a care plan for the infant's final hours or days.

The baby suffers from a rare genetic disease, mitochondrial depletion syndrome, which has caused brain damage and left him unable to breathe unaided. Recent tests found Charlie has irreversible muscular damage.

""It is in Charlie's best interests to be moved to a hospice and for him at that point to be moved to a palliative care regime only,"" the judge said as a medical and legal battle that has drawn international attention nears a wrenching conclusion.

Debate over Charlie's future became so heated that his doctors and hospital staff received death threats, CBS News correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti reports.

Family of Charlie Gard via AP

The parents, Connie Yates and Chris Gard, spent months trying to persuade Great Ormond Street Hospital to let Charlie go to the United States for experimental treatment. They gave up their fight on Monday, acknowledging that the window of opportunity to help him had closed.

On Tuesday, they said they hoped to bring their son, whose 1st birthday is next week, home to die. Francis said Charlie's mother and father now accept that the only options for their son ""are the hospital or the hospice.""

The Thursday deadline is meant to yield a plan for what happens after the baby is transferred to a hospice. The parents want him kept on his ventilator for a time. The hospital, in fighting the parents' earlier effort to secure experimental treatment, had indicated that it was responsible for sparing Charlie unnecessary pain.

Francis said if the parties do not reach an agreement, Charlie will be taken to hospice and the ventilation system keeping him alive will be turned off. He issued an order barring publication of the name of the hospice and the date when Charlie is taken there.

The judge said it was a ""very, very sad conclusion.""

Charlie's mother left the courtroom in distress before the judge gave his ruling.

""What if it was your child?"" Yates said amid sobs. As she left, she said: ""I hope you are happy with yourselves.""

In conceding that Charlie would leave the hospital for a hospice instead of home, Yates requested a medical team of her choosing that would work to keep her son alive for a week. He is not expected to survive for more than a few hours once his ventilator is removed.

The request indicated that the parents had backed away from their earlier expressed wish to take Charlie home for ""a few days of tranquility"" before his ventilator was disconnected and he was allowed to ""slip away.""

Great Ormond Street Hospital said it was not practical to provide life-support treatment for days at the couple's home. Nurses from the hospital nonetheless have volunteered to care for him in his final hours.

The parents' cause caught the attention of President Trump and Pope Francis and also garnered widespread grassroots support. U.S.-based pro-life activists have flown to London to support Charlie's parents.

The case has become the catalyst for discussions on health care funding, medical intervention, the role of the state and the rights of the child.

The heated commentary has prompted the judge to criticize the effects of social media and those ""who know almost nothing about this case but who feel entitled to express opinions."""

Police said Jordan C. Lamonde, 22, was arrested on Monday afternoon and charged with second-degree assault.

""This was a vicious, unprovoked attack that shocked our community, and I am proud to report that the suspect has been identified and apprehended,"" Police Chief Paul Toussaint said.

On June 12 at about 10 p.m., surveillance video shows the beginning moments of a man attacking 18-year-old Erin McCarthy from behind as she walked to her car.

Police said the Lamonde punched McCarthy 39 times and threw her to the ground.

McCarthy did not sustain major injuries despite the multiple blows.

""I mean, he threw me around like a rag doll, so I kind of just let it happen,"" McCarthy said last month.

About a month after the attack, police said they were still unable to make an arrest due to a company processing records for a search warrant related to the case though they had a strong suspect in mind.

McCarthy told CBS Boston she believes the attack was revenge for a dispute Lamonde had with her ex-boyfriend.

Police said he waited outside for McCarthy, who works inside, for nearly the entirety of her eight-hour shift.

Lamonde was held on $150,000 cash bail and will be arraigned on Tuesday at Strafford County Superior Court."
208,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/lorde-returns-to-the-crazy-environment-melodrama/,cbsnews,"Lorde returns to the ""crazy environment""",[],"Now, just in time for summer, singer-songwriter Lorde is releasing a new album -- and talking with our Anthony Mason in one of her favorite places:

One of the most anticipated albums of the year had its inspiration underground, in the New York City subway.

For nearly a year, Lorde used the F Train as her mobile office: ""I love this train; it's my favorite,"" she said. ""I think it's okay to have a favorite train!""

""Did you actually do writing down here on the subway?"" Mason asked.

""Every day. Twice a day. I, like, thanked the subway in my album notes, because I wouldn't have been able to make the record without it. I found it such an amazing space to kind of be around people.""

CBS News

On her daily ride to the recording studio (usually unrecognized), the New Zealand-born singer worked on the words and music for ""Melodrama"" (below), the album she'll finally release this week.

Lava/Republic

""On the train there would be a lot of coming up with an idea and singing it into my phone, kind of as quietly as I could so no one would hear me.""

Mason asked, ""Did you freak out at all during the making of this record?""

""I definitely had real moments of true despair, like, This is terrible. I shouldn't be allowed to do this.""

The pressure was so great it took her four years to follow up the record that literally changed pop music: ""Royals.""

Ella Yellich O'Connor (Lorde's real name) was 15 and still turning in homework when she wrote ""Royals."" It spent nine weeks at #1 and earned her two Grammys.

David Bowie said listening to her music felt ""like listening to tomorrow."" But Lorde found the sudden fame an odd fit, claiming she's not very good at being famous.

""I'm not!"" she laughed. ""It's hard. It's all body language and, like, the subtlety, the angles -- I don't know the angles.""

She aspired to be an artist, not a star. Ella, who grew up in a suburb of Auckland, was fronting the high school band at age 12 and devouring books. ""Yeah, I had no friends and I read a ton of books,"" she laughed.

Her father is a civil engineer; her mother, a poet laureate.

""I remember being two and lying awake in my Mum's bed talking about our favorite fruits and why we love them,"" she laughed. ""There's a lyric on the album where I say, 'I am my mother's child.' I don't think I was ever going to be anything but an artist because of my Mum!""

Sonia Yellich still accompanies her 20-year-old daughter on her travels. She's remarked that Ella's head is always on fire. ""Oh, great!"" Lorde laughed.

Is it true? ""I don't know about on fire. It's definitely, there's such a current around me all the time.

""The way I go through the world and the way I see things, it's so, it's like in Technicolor. It's like magic to me and I feel like I have to get people to see what it is I'm seeing.""

Her sensitivity is heightened by a neurological condition called synesthesia, where sounds conjure colors and textures in her mind.

""And you see or feel what?"" Mason asked.

""It's like a colored gas that fills the room. It's pretty cool. It's pretty crazy!""

""Does it help your writing?""

""I think it definitely sends the writing in a certain direction. I think that I make the choices that I make with songs, in part, because of the synesthesia.""

To watch Lorde perform ""Green Light,"" from her album ""Melodrama,"" click on the video player below.

Mason asked, ""While you were making this record, you had a pretty big breakup.""

""Yeah. I was able to make a record about being alone, and celebrating that, and absolutely hating that. But being solitary was the thing that really unlocked the process.""

To watch Lorde perform ""Liability,"" from her album ""Melodrama,"" click on the video player below.

""You yourself have said this record in spots is a little weird,"" Mason said.

""It is kind of weird, yeah. I think about someone like David Bowie, and every record was such a pivot. And you know, you almost felt afraid of pressing play on a new record -- Am I gonna even understand this? And I think that throwing people into that sort of fear is, like, the most important thing you can do as an artist, long-term.""

The day Mason joined Lorde, she was headed to a rehearsal studio, where she began by jumping online to release her latest single.

""It's all happening, Anthony! It's up on Twitter. So weird!""

She was rehearsing for her appearance at last weekend's Governor's Ball Festival.

CBS News

""Are you as happy on stage as you are in the studio?"" Mason asked.

""I think I'm happiest in the studio. Stage is different because I get so nervous that it's like a weird trance,"" Lorde said. ""When I'm on stage I feel myself go right to the edge of the cliff, so to speak. If I broke my arm on stage, I wouldn't know, I don't think, because you're just so dialed into this crazy environment.""

After nearly four years away from that ""crazy environment,"" with her album release, Lorde returns this week.

""Do you feel ready to be back, if you will?""

""I don't know if I'll ever feel ready -- 'being back' is that thing we talked about of not being a very good famous person? But no. I'm ready to be in conversation with the world again.""

213,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ios-11-new-iphone-features/,cbsnews,Everything iOS 11 is going to bring to your iPhone,['Jessica Dolcourt'],"Apple just announced iOS 11 — the next version of its software to power your iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch — as its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) kicked off Monday.

The biggest changes come to Siri, Apple's voice assistant; some redesigns, like to the lock screen, App Store and Control Center; and augmented reality (AR) software that's going to mesh the virtual world onto your own.

All these updates and more will bring a wave of new features to your device, and — even more exciting to tech-watchers — to Apple's next iPhones. For that reason, iOS 11 is especially important. As the operating system set to power the hotly-anticipated 10th anniversary iPhone, changes to iOS drop some major hints about what the iPhone 8 (or whatever Apple calls it) will be able to do.

The iPhone is Apple's most popular device, and also its biggest moneymaker. (iPhones make up more than two-thirds of Apple's total sales, including laptops.) But phone sales have dropped in the past four out of five quarters, despite the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus's popularity. iOS 11 could help lure buyers by reinvigorating the software innards behind the next iPhone's hardware shell.

What's new in iOS 11

AR is coming to your iPhone and iPad

When you look at your iPhone or iPad screen, you'll be able to interact with virtual items overlaid in your real world. For example, you can place items like a lamp in your living room, or see Pokemon monsters on the sidewalk at your feet

Apple is just now launching the developer platform (called ARKit), so this isn't something you'll be able to use right away. (My guess is September when we expect Apple to launch its next iPhones.)

Why we care: This kind of deep software supports rumors that Apple is going to add a lot more computing power to the iPhone camera.

Siri wants to suggest what you want next

Siri can now translate languages (English to Chinese, French, German, Italian, Spanish for starters)

Suggest topics you'll want to know based on what you're doing

Siri will learn words from articles you use, and suggest them when you type

Make a calendar appointment based on what you searched on the web

Private, for you and your devices only (it won't be web accessible)

Why we care: Apple's Siri assistant has lagged behind Google's (and even Amazon's Alexa). Prediction and translation help close the gap a little.

Camera app changes mean more pics for you

Images will take up a lot less storage space thanks to new compression technology

Low-light photos using optical image stabilization

The two cameras on the iPhone 7 Plus captures depth info. Now devs can access that and use in apps

Live photos can now be trimmed

Why we care: The most important change is that you'll be able to save a lot more photos and videos.

Control Center shrinks to a single panel

One panel instead of three

3D Touch is going to let you dive in to more granular controls

Why we care: The three-panel layout was a drag. This should be easier to use by putting the controls we care about in one place, not three.

Lock screen and notification center become one

Scroll up to see notifications from the lock screen

Still get widgets on the left and camera on the right

Why we care: This should give you a more convenient glance at alerts.

Photos can get more dynamic

You can loop a live photo to make a movie (like, of a never-ending bubble blow)

You can grab and save a still frame from a video

New long exposure effect can help you take really great nature shots of moving water and more

Movies captured in ""Memories"" will now play in Portrait mode, not just landscape

Why we care: Nothing here really stands out yet, but looping a live video seems like an easy way to make a hilarious GIF.

iMessages will sync convos better

When you sync into another new device, iCloud will sync all your messages (which also means if you delete it on the iPhone, it'll delete on your laptop and iPad, etc.)



Why we care: Less clutter.

Use Apple Pay to pay your friends

Peer-to-peer payments are right in iMessage

You can make purchases and bank transfers

Authenticate with your fingerprint

iOS devices and Apple Watch 2

QuickType keyboard will suggest that you pay your friend... within the message

Why we care: You can pay your buddy back for dinner without having to sign into a new service. Easy.

Apple Maps dives indoors

Detailed airport and mall floorplans (you can browse by floor)

Watch your speed because speed limits are part of Maps

There's also guidance to tell you which lane you'll need to change into

Why we care: You might not get as lost finding the pretzel stand on your way to the gate.

Apple Car Play adds ""Do Not Disturb"" mode

When you install iOS 11, you'll get a Do Not Disturb While Driving mode

It'll chop out notifications and show you... nothing. Because you're driving. Eyes on the road!

If you're actually not driving, you can tap to undo

There's an auto-response to let people know you're driving

Some special people will be able to get your attention if notices are urgent

Why we care: Distracted driving is bad news for road safety. This is a step in the right direction.

Apple music gets more shareable

Want to play music in multiple rooms through different speakers? You can now (through an AirPlay 2 protocol)

You can make playlists public to your friends

To make it more social, Apple is opening up Apple Music hook-ins to third-party apps, like Shazam

Why we care: You can set up surround sound music in your home with speakers you already have.

Stephen Lam/Reuters

Brand new App Store

Apple totally redesigned it

Separate tabs for Apps, Games and Today's featured apps

In-app purchases will also get a featured spot, like if there's a brand-new level or character they can buy



Why we care: If it helps makes new apps easier to find, that's fine by us.

iOS 11 takes iPad to the next level

The new app dock includes tricks like opening apps by pulling them up from the dock

It has been dubbed, appropriately enough, the ""Great American Eclipse.""

""It really is fortunate,"" said Matthew Penn, an astronomer with the National Optical Astronomy Observatory who is leading a nationwide effort to photograph the eclipse from 68 sites along the path of totality.

NASA

""The U.S. only covers 2 percent of the globe, so we get very few eclipses,"" he said. ""And to have one travel across the entire country is an unprecedented sort of opportunity. It'll be a heck of day. The best thing is, it can't be cloudy everywhere!""

The first inklings of what's to come will be visible from the Oregon coast, weather permitting, around 9:05 a.m. local time (12:05 p.m. EDT) when viewers with safety filters, from inexpensive cardboard ""solar glasses"" to more sophisticated aids, will see the moon begin to take a bite out of the sun, the start of a partial solar eclipse.

A partial eclipse will be visible across the entire United States, including Alaska and Hawaii, Canada, Central America and northern South America, with more than half of the sun obscured for residents across the lower 48 states.

But for millions of viewers who make their way into the narrow path of totality, a partial eclipse, a thrilling sight in its own right, will serve as an appetizer for the main course, the all-too-fleeting moments when the moon completely blocks out the sun.

Michael Zeiler, www.GreatAmericanEclipse.com

Moving across the Pacific Ocean at more than 2,400 mph, the dark inner heart of the moon's shadow -- the umbra -- will move ashore near Lincoln Beach, Ore., at 10:16 a.m. local time (1:16 p.m. EDT), and then sweep across 14 states and 20 national parks over the next hour and a half.

More than 200 million people live within a day's drive of the path of totality, potentially turning the Great American Eclipse into one of the most heavily viewed and shared events in recent memory.

""The Great American Eclipse on Aug. 21 is such an exciting event, it is a really singular and unique event in human history, really, where in the 21st century we have this amazing technology with social media,"" said Carrie Black, associate program director of the National Science Foundation's Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences.

""And it's happening across the United States, so the entire country can participate,"" she said. ""There's never been an event like this in human history where so many people could participate and with such unique technology.""

When the eclipse arrives

Two minutes and 145 miles after the leading edge of the moon's shadow crosses the coast of Oregon, a partial eclipse will begin in the small town of Madras at 9:07 a.m. local time (12:07 p.m. EDT). With clear skies the rule this time of year, thousands of tourists and astronomers, both amateur and professional, are expected to join 6,400 area residents to take in the show.

One hour and 12 minutes after the start of the partial eclipse, at 10:19 a.m., the moon will completely block out the sun above Madras, turning a bright morning into deep twilight for the next two minutes and two seconds.

The temperature will drop, bright stars like Regulus will appear and the sun's super-heated corona will shimmer into view like a halo around the unseen moon. The light coming in from around the horizon, from beyond the edge of the moon's shadow, will appear in pinkish-orange hues like a 360-degree sunset.

""It's not as dark as night, for the most part,"" said Rick Fienberg a spokesman for the American Astronomical Society who holds a doctorate in astronomy. ""This one, the shadow's only about 70 miles wide. So 35 miles away from you, in every direction, it's light. The sky during a total solar eclipse is not black, it's blue.""

But the star of the show, so to speak, is the sun's corona, a magnetically energized region above the sun's visible surface -- the photosphere -- where the temperature suddenly -- and inexplicably -- climbs from about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit to nearly 4 million degrees.

Rick Fienberg / TravelQuest International / Wilderness Travel

The solar wind, a torrent of electrically charged particles, is accelerated to enormous velocities in the corona, spewing into space in all directions and reaching the farthest corners of the solar system. What drives the corona's extreme temperatures and accelerates the solar wind is a mystery, in part because the region is so difficult to study.

The inner regions of the corona can only be studied during a total solar eclipse when the moon completely blocks the sun's glare. Satellite instruments and ground-based telescopes create their own artificial eclipses, inserting a circular sun shade into a camera's light path that acts like a miniature moon.

But to keep from blinding sensitive detectors, such coronagraphs must block the sun's light out to more than a solar diameter. During a total solar eclipse, the actual moon does a much better job, revealing the corona's mysterious innermost regions.

""What's particularly special about a natural eclipse is that the moon is a perfect occulter, it blocks the surface of the sun just perfectly so you can see very low into the solar atmosphere,"" Black said. ""Scientists are particularly interested in the low corona, because that's where lots of activity is, that's where the origins of space weather are.""

With the Aug. 21 eclipse's coast-to-coast track across America, astronomers and citizen scientists will have a golden opportunity to learn more about the processes at work in the corona as millions along the path of totality get a chance to witness the sun's fiery halo.

NASA

""What you see is the jet black silhouette of the moon framed by the beautiful white of the corona, streaming out in all directions, usually several diameters of the sun away,"" Fienberg said. ""What makes it especially wonderful is the quality of the light, and the fact that the corona behaves like iron filings around a bar magnet, it traces the sun's magnetic field. So you see loops and streamers ... and it's just spectacular.

""And the light, the quality of the light is very unusual, too,"" he added. ""You're looking at glowing ionized gas, which is like what's in a fluorescent bulb or something, it's a mix of that and a mix of sunlight reflected off electrons and sunlight reflected off dust in the solar system, so it's a very different kind of light than ordinary daylight.""

Unlike the partial phases of a solar eclipse, when even a sliver of sunlight can cause eye damage if viewed for extended periods or any sort of optical aid, the fully eclipsed sun is safe to look at during the few minutes the moon completely covers the sun's disk.

Jay M. Pasachoff

""The total amount of light coming from the eclipsed sun, that's about as much light as comes from a full moon,"" Fienberg said. ""That's why we keep telling people, it's perfectly safe to look at the totally eclipsed sun. Once every last part of the sun's bright everyday face is covered, what's left, the corona, is about as bright as the full moon. So it's no more dangerous to look at.""

Fienberg will be in Madras with a tour group, his 13th trip to witness a total solar eclipse. His advice to first-time eclipse watchers: don't worry about telescopes or sophisticated optics. Just take in one of nature's grandest shows with the unaided eye.

""If you just look at it with a telescope, you're going to see the solar corona and you're going to see all kinds of interesting loops and streamers and things, but you're going to miss the broader effect. You might not see the sunset colors around the horizon, you might not realize how blue the sky is because in the telescope it'll just look black,"" he said.

""You won't see bright stars and planets that come out around the sun because they're going to be outside the field of view of the telescope. I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to alternate between using low-power binoculars and my naked eye.""

The view in binoculars is ""really breathtaking,"" he said, ""because you see a lot more detail in the corona, but you also see it in context, you see the whole sun and the whole corona and you get the bluish sky in the background.""

While it might seem contrary to countless warnings, using binoculars during totality, when the sun's light is completely blocked, is not dangerous in and of itself. And the observer will see clear signs totality is ending in plenty of time to look away and switch back to a filtered view.

But aside from the few minutes of totality, one should never look at the sun directly, experts warn, with or without optical aid, even during a nearly full partial eclipse, without using an internationally certified filter designed to reduce the sun's glare to a safe level.

""There's probably going to be an uptick in eye injuries no matter how much you tell people and how easy it is to get your hands on solar filters,"" Fienberg said. ""There are always people who will either ignore the messaging or just take unnecessary risks. But ... it's really hard to hurt yourself by looking at the sun too long. It's very uncomfortable.""

Cross-country path of eclipse

From Madras, the moon's shadow will race across Oregon and into Idaho, passing just north of Boise before moving on across Idaho Falls at 11:33 a.m. local time (1:33 p.m. EDT), Casper, Wyoming, at 11:42 a.m. (1:42 p.m. EDT), Grand Island, Nebraska, at 12:58 p.m. (1:58 p.m. EDT), St. Joseph, Missouri, at 1:06 p.m. (2:06 p.m. EDT) and nearby Columbia six minutes later. By this point, the shadow will have slowed to about 1,500 mph.

Residents of the northeast corner of Kansas City, just inside the path of totality, will enjoy about a minute of darkness around 1:08 p.m. (2:08 p.m. EDT) as will residents in southwestern St. Louis a few minutes after that.

Crossing the Mississippi River, the center of the moon's shadow will pass just south of Carbondale, Illinois, at 1:20 p.m. (2:20 p.m. EDT) before moving over Paducah and Hopkinsville, Kentucky, at 1:24 p.m. (2:24 p.m. EDT).

Along this stretch, eclipse watchers will enjoy the maximum duration of the eclipse, about two minutes and 40 seconds of totality.

From Kentucky, the shadow will move across Clarksville and then Nashville, Tennessee, the largest city in the path of totality, at 1:27 p.m. (2:27 p.m. EDT) crossing over the Smokey Mountains, the southwest corner of North Carolina and then racing over the heart of South Carolina where viewers in Greenville, Columbia, Charleston will enjoy totality between 2:38 p.m. and 2:47 p.m. EDT

The moon's shadow then will move off shore and out over the Atlantic Ocean, one hour and 33 minutes after the umbra crossed the coast of Oregon some 2,500 miles away.

Given its coast-to-coast track through the heartland of the United States, many observers believe the 2017 eclipse will be one of the most viewed in history and certainly the most scientifically studied.

""The other reason this is going to be so well observed is because we now live in a social media era,"" Fienberg said. ""Before, there were no smartphones, there was no Facebook, there was no Twitter. You have to literally be locked in an underground bunker to not be able to find out what's going on outside.

""So, everybody's going to hear about this, one way or another, and with any luck, they're going to get excited. ... Even if they don't make it into the path of totality, a deep partial eclipse, observed safely, can be fun.""

Williams College astronomer Jay Pasachoff, author of an article outlining planned eclipse research in the August issue of Scientific American magazine, plans to observe his 66th solar eclipse from the campus of Willamette University in Salem, Ore., along with an international team of researchers and a battery of telescopes, cameras and spectrographs.

""We've done preliminary versions of this before, but things get refined, the theoretical models get refined and the instruments get better,"" he said in an interview. ""We only have about two minutes, so you do the measurements you can. Each time we have an eclipse, the loops of gas, the shape of the corona, the magnetic field is different. So you want to take those couple of minutes whenever you can and find out what's going on there.""

Pasachoff team is one of scores that will be stationed along -- and above -- the path of totality. At least 11 NASA spacecraft will train their instruments on the sun, more than 50 high-altitude balloons will take photographs and study the effects of the eclipse on Earth's atmosphere, along with aircraft carrying a variety of instruments.

Hundreds of ground-based observatories will swing into action with numerous focused teams of researchers spread out along the path of totality. Veteran eclipse astronomer Shadia Habbal of the University of Hawaii will lead five such teams that, like Pasachoff's, will be studying the inner corona.

Penn is leading a team made up of more than 200 volunteers using identical telescopes, cameras and computers at 68 locations along the path of totality.

The goal of Penn's Citizen CATE (Continental-America Telescopic Eclipse) project is to assemble a carefully calibrated movie of the eclipse to learn more about how the sun's magnetic field accelerates particles in the corona. Data will be collected using identical telescopes, cameras and computers operated by volunteers, including students and astronomy club members.

""The thing that excites me the most about this eclipse is that millions of people across the country, in the path of totality, can walk out on their porch in their slippers and collect world-class data,"" Penn said. ""They won't have to travel to a large telescope on top of a mountain, you can go into your backyard using fairly modest-size instruments and collect really important research data.""

A more public project, the Eclipse Megamovie, is led by Hugh Hudson, a solar physicist at the University of California at Berkeley. His team is soliciting imagery from volunteers ""as an outreach thing,"" he said, ""and make a big movie that incorporates all the images.""

""It will be complicated, but in principle you can ... create an actual movie,"" he said. ""That's never been done before as far as I can tell, and this is a wonderful opportunity for us.""

In an interview, Pasachoff advised the public to take in the partial phases of the eclipse with low-cost solar filters. For viewers in the path of totality, ""just keep looking through them and when that presence diminishes and becomes invisible through the glasses you put the glasses down and watch for a couple of minutes.""

""If you want to look up in those two minutes, which is between two minutes on the Oregon coast on the central line and two minutes 40 seconds in Illinois, then you can glance with binoculars for a few seconds to see some of the detail in the corona. But it's also nice to look around the sky and see what stars and planets you can see and look at that sunset effect on the horizon all around you.""

The shape of the corona changes during the sun's 11-year sunspot cycle as the number of spots wax and wane. The sun currently is moving into the minimum phase of the cycle ""and that means that the corona will be very extended at the sun's equator and it won't hide the plumes of hot gas, the million-degree-gas, that's coming out of the poles,"" Pasachoff said.

""So we'll have an opportunity to study this gas at the poles for the first time in about eight or 10 years.""

For eclipse novices taking in their first total solar eclipse, Pasachoff said astronomers will ""be glad to give you our pictures.""

""Don't cut into your enjoyment by being too busy with your camera, just watch,"" he said, echoing Fienberg's advice.

Does the view ever get old?

""No, it gets better and better,"" he said.

Will weather conditions cooperate?

But all that assumes the weather cooperates. Canadian meteorologist and eclipse enthusiast Jay Anderson has produced a chart based on more than 15 years of data to give a sense of how much cloud cover might be expected in late August along the path of totality.

In Madras, for example, eclipse chasers can expect average cloud cover between around 15 and 20 percent. Moving east, cloud cover generally increases depending on topography and other factors. In Nashville, up to 70 percent of the afternoon sky can be cloud covered.

But as Fienberg noted, climate is what one expects, weather is what one actually gets, ""the idea being that you can predict the statistical likelihood of clear skies based on past history, but weather is a very local phenomenon.""

That said, ""the northwest is going to have a much better chance of clear skies than the southeast.""

""And so, many of the people who are going to be making a sincere effort to see totality are going to be heading to the northwest,"" he said. ""Oregon is very popular, Wyoming, Idaho and Nebraska, all through those states the path of totality is predicted to be 80 percent or 70 percent chance of clear skies. The only exception being the Oregon coast itself.""

The weather might be better in the northwest, but because of the moon's orbital track and changing distance from the Earth, totality will last longer in the southeast.

""Two minutes and 40 seconds in southern Illinois and western Kentucky, whereas it's only going to be a couple of seconds over two minutes in Oregon,"" Fienberg said. ""You want to go where the eclipse will be long, so you tend to go to the point where it's maximum and as close to the center of the path as you can. But you also want to go where the weather prospects are good.

""In this case, a lot of people are going to the northwest,"" he said. ""Even though the eclipse won't be as long, the chance of clear skies is better.""

And if the weather doesn't cooperate, your car breaks down or your flight is canceled before you can reach the path of totality, you'll get a second chance in 2024 due to the nature of the moon's orbit and Earth's path around the sun.

During the 2024 eclipse, the moon's shadow will cross the U.S. border in southern Texas and move up into the eastern half of the United States, passing over Dallas-Fort Worth, Cleveland, Ohio, Buffalo, New York, and Montreal.

The moon will be closer during the 2024 eclipse, its shadow will be wider and totality will last more than four minutes along most of its track across the United States. The paths of the 2017 and 2024 eclipses will cross near Carbondale, Illinois, where residents will witness their second bout of totality in just six and a half years.

""So if you can't get to totality this time, you're going to see all the pictures and movies on the internet, you're going to hear from people who went, you're going to be really motivated for the next one,"" Fienberg said. ""And you've got six and a half years to plan for it."""

Una veladora ilumina el rostro de Adán Lara, de 27 años.

Él le salvó la vida a 29 migrantes más que viajaban en el tráiler abandonado en un estacionamiento en San Antonio, Texas.

Con la ayuda de un desarmador logró abrir un pequeño orificio en la caja del tráiler.

Así, lo contó a su esposa Dulce Briones: ""Empezó a escuchar que decían que no podían respirar y todo y que él sí, acató eso que llevaba en la bolsa y empezó a hacer un agujerito en el tráiler y que fue cuando tomaban turnos para tomar el aire"", narró.

Adán también contó que logró escapar cuando abrieron las puertas del tráiler, pero decidió entregarse al ver la desgracia de los demás migrantes que no lograron sobrevivir, agregó Dulce Briones.

""Dice, yo pude haberme ido pero dice, no tuve el valor, dice yo me regresé y vi esa patrulla y me les atravesé para que me agarraran y poderles dar información"".

Junto con Adán, viajaba José Luis Rodríguez, otro sobreviviente y hasta que regrese las veladoras seguirán encendidas.

Patricia Briones, esposa de José Rodríguez, afirmó ""lo necesitamos mucho aquí, que lo esperamos mis niños y yo"".

En Palo Alto-El Llano, Aguascalientes, estas historias no son nuevas, ""los polleros"" cobran cinco mil dólares sin garantía de llegar vivo o muerto y lograr el sueño americano.

José Luis Briones, suegro de José Luis Briones, declaró: ""A veces que se va uno ahí mismo a la frontera y ahí mismo en la frontera agarra un coyote ahí mismo; si ya una vez yo me fui y también me agarraron dos veces"".

Las familias de Adán y José Luis saben que se encuentran estables de salud y esperan verles pronto.

Dulce Briones explicó: ""La verdad a mí me da tristeza porque el llevaba un sueño pero no se pudo cumplir, pero si le doy gracias a Dios que él esté vivo"".

El Palo Alto-El Llano, el milagro sucedió, mientras en el municipio de Calvillo esperan los cuerpos de dos hidrocálidos que no lograron sobrevivir.

Is it a case of cause and effect? Anna Werner has been investigating the phenomenon known as ""cancer clusters"":

Dr. Thomas Sherman is on the hunt for a killer.

""To get there we'll come up Grove Road, Washington Road, and we'll go right up here,"" he told Werner. ""Here's where the landfill is, where this arrow is.""

CBS News

He's heading a task force investigating why several children in the Seacoast region of New Hampshire developed a rare cancer, called rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), the cancer that took the life of Paul Thomas' 14-year-old son, Sam.

""It's something missing in your life, and it'll always be there,"" Thomas said.

Paul and his wife, Lynne, say two years after Sam's death, the questions persist.

""In your head you're like, why are there three cases, that you can go off at the top of your head, in the Seacoast area? Why?"" Lynne said.

The state says it's a cancer cluster, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines as ""a greater-than-expected number of cancer cases that occurs within a group of people in a geographic area over a period of time.""

And while that definition may be black-and-white, it turns out that almost everything else is anything but.

State health departments get an average of a thousand reports of alleged clusters every year, but historically, only a handful are ultimately recognized as true residential cancer clusters.

One of those is the 1980s case of Woburn, Massachusetts, a story told by the book and movie, ""A Civil Action."" More than 20 cases of leukemia in children were linked to chemical contamination of the public water supply, according to epidemiologist Suzanne Condon, who investigated for the state.

Werner asked, ""How hard is it to figure out if something really is a cancer cluster?""

""I've been asked that before, and my standard response is, extraordinary difficult at best,"" Condon replied.

Toms River, New Jersey is another recognized case. But some other notorious incidents, often thought to be cancer clusters, were not. That includes the California events depicted in the movie ""Erin Brockovich,"" and the infamous Love Canal case in upstate New York.

Investigators have to consider several factors, including: How often the cancer occurred; how long it took for it to develop; whether genetics might play a role; and one more thing ... chance.

""It seems like people want to say, 'It just can't be a coincidence,"" said Werner.

""I think people have a hard time understanding that sometimes there are random patterns of disease, and things can happen because of chance,"" Condon said.

And as for the Seacoast cancer cluster? ""I think they have an incredible challenge before them,"" she suggested.

So far, Dr. Sherman and others are focusing their questions on an old closed landfill where, they say, the military and others dumped toxic wastes.

New Hampshire officials say they have found chemicals used to make commercial products in some wells near the landfill. But they say there's no proof they are linked to the suspected Seacoast cancer cluster, and those responsible for the landfill deny there's any connection.

But the Thomases still hope for an answer, one they hope might save someone else's child.

""These rare cancers are out there,"" said Lynne. ""And I really think that that has to be looked at, so that Sam's death was not in vain.""

Authorities said the video shows a hero taking down a man who will soon face many felony charges, CBS affiliate KGPE-TV in Fresno reports.

Cregg Jerri, 58, was enjoying his Starbucks order and working on his iPad at 5:30 p.m. on Thursday when a man holding a yellow bag and wearing an Optimus Prime Transformers mask entered the store. The suspect demanded money and began threatening the clerk with a fake gun and a buck knife.

Police said Jerri came swooping in, hitting the suspect with a chair from behind in an attempt to stop the robbery. A fight ensued, and Jerri was stabbed in the neck during the struggle, but he wrestled the knife away from the suspect, who eventually fled the scene.

In 1953, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were sent to the electric chair for conspiring to provide the secrets of the atomic bomb to the Soviet Union. They left behind two little boys, Robert and Michael, just 6 and 10 years old at the time.

The brothers Rosenberg were the orphans of Communist spies at the height of the McCarthy era. Relatives were afraid to take them in. One town blocked them from attending its schools. What ever happened to those two little boys? It's a remarkable story, a piece of American history that hasn't been fully told.

CBS News

Anderson Cooper: People would ask you?

Michael Meeropol: Oh yeah, ""Are you related to those two spies?"" ""No."" But I really hated myself.

""We were the children of Communist spies. Being the Rosenberg's children in 1950 was almost like being Osama bin Laden's kids here after 9/11.""

Anderson Cooper: Hated yourself because you were—

Michael Meeropol: I was denying-- I was too scared to-- admit that my parents were my parents.

Robert Meeropol: We were the children of Communist spies. Being the Rosenberg's children in 1950 was almost like being Osama bin Laden's kids here after 9/11.

Today, they're known by their adopted names, Michael and Robert Meeropol, but in 1950, they were Michael and Robby Rosenberg, ages 7 and 3, living in New York City's Lower East Side, with their parents Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The Rosenbergs were ardent Communists but Michael doesn't recall his parents ever using that word. Ethel was a stay-at-home mom who loved to sing. Julius – an engineer who ran a small machine shop. That's Michael on his shoulders.

Michael Meeropol: My father would take me to places like Prospect Park and, you know, get some peanuts and feed squirrels.

Anderson Cooper: What was he like?

Michael Meeropol: He was very energetic. He had a smile on his face a heck of a lot of times. And I remember traveling around with him. In fact, I rode on the subway with him so often that I kind of wondered, you know, when he was working.

Anderson Cooper: And your mom? What was she like?

Michael Meeropol: She was very affectionate. A lot of hugging and kissing. And I remember that she was often cooking. The thing I remember is just a normal life.

But then, in the summer of 1950, FBI agents began rounding up a network of alleged Communist spies. On July 17th, they knocked on the Rosenbergs' door.

AP

Michael Meeropol: I'm listening to ""The Lone Ranger."" And the door opens. And there is all these people in the room, who, you know, I guess-- friends of daddy's. But then my mother yells, ""I had-- I want a lawyer."" And I knew something was weird. And then the radio's turned off. Well, I'm a brash 7-year-old and I turned it back on. Somebody turned it off again. After about three times, I gave up, 'cause, you know, the attention was on my father. And then he disappears. He's gone.

Julius was accused of running a spy ring that tried to help the Soviet Union make an atomic bomb. After he refused to talk to the FBI, Ethel was arrested too.

Michael Meeropol: All I remember is I'm on the phone with her. And she says, ""I'm under arrest."" And I say, ""You can't come home?"" She says, ""No, I can't."" And I don't remember anything else about the phone call, but the story is that I screamed and that it gave her nightmares for the rest of her life.

Anderson Cooper: That scream?

Michael Meeropol: Yeah. It tore her heart.

Their grandmother put them up for a few months, but Michael and Robby say she resented their presence. When other relatives refused to care for them, they were sent to a children's shelter in the Bronx.

Anderson Cooper: Why didn't other family members take you in?

Robert Meeropol: They were terrified. Like, for instance, my father's older sister wanted to take us in. But her husband owned a small grocery store. And he said, ""If people find out I've taken in the children of the Rosenbergs-- they won't buy food from my store.""

Anderson Cooper: So then you're sent, essentially, to an orphanage?

Michael Meeropol: Yeah.

Anderson Cooper: What was that like?

Michael Meeropol: I remember it as horrible. Like something out of Dickens. The staff was pretty free with the slaps and the abuse. I felt like I was in prison.

Anderson Cooper: You felt like you were in prison, as well, not just--

Michael Meeropol: Yeah. Oh, absolutely.

Anderson Cooper: --your parents?

Michael Meeropol: One week after I was there, I remember crying to anybody I would talk-- I said, ""I've been here a week. Don't you think they could let me go home now?""

The chief witness against their parents was their uncle, David Greenglass, who'd worked at the military's atomic bomb-making plant in Los Alamos, New Mexico. In March 1951, Greenglass testified he'd given sketches of the atomic bomb to Julius Rosenberg, and that Ethel had typed up his handwritten notes. David Greenglass's wife Ruth told the same story under oath. It took the jury only eight hours to reach a verdict.

[NEWSREEL: Headline: Death to A-Spies. Rosenbergs Get Top Penalty In Atom Trial: One of the greatest peacetime spy dramas in the nation's history reaches its climax.]

The judge sentenced the Rosenbergs to death, saying he considered their crime worse than murder, because he believed they'd put the atomic bomb in Soviet hands earlier than anyone had expected. While their lawyers appealed the decision, the Rosenbergs were taken to New York's Sing-Sing prison to await execution. Robby and Michael, now 4 and 8 years old, hadn't seen their parents for a year, but they were allowed to visit them at Sing-Sing.

Anderson Cooper: I heard that you asked to see the electric chair?

Michael Meeropol: Yep. The very first visit I said to a guard, ""Let me see the electric chair.""

Anderson Cooper: Why did you want to see the electric chair?

Michael Meeropol: I didn't want to see the electric chair. I wanted to prove to the people at the prison I wasn't afraid of it.

Robert Meeropol: I remember that the prison seemed like a big fortress that we were entering, this gray stone building, almost medieval like. But when we went into the visiting room, everything was kind of quiet and calm, which is what I needed. And I think that's because my parents made a conscious effort, to try to act that way. And so you could say that they fooled me. And I wanted to be fooled.

Michael Meeropol: I remember asking them both in Sing-Sing if they were innocent. I said, ""Are you really innocent?"" And they reacted, ""But of course we are,"" you know? And that was enough for me for, you know decades.

But it wasn't enough for the Supreme Court, which denied the Rosenbergs' appeal. Never before in the U.S. had a husband and wife been sentenced to the electric chair, which would make their children orphans. The Rosenbergs' supporters held protests all over the world, arguing the couple was innocent and the sentence unjust. Albert Einstein, Pablo Picasso, and the pope appealed for clemency. Days before the scheduled execution, Michael and Robby joined demonstrators in Washington, D.C., and hand-delivered a plea for mercy to the White House. But President Eisenhower refused to intervene. On June 16th, 1953, -- nearly three years after their parents had been arrested -- the boys visited them at Sing-Sing for the last time.

Michael Meeropol: And as I was leaving, I started to wail, ""One more day to live. One more day to live.""

Anderson Cooper: You actually said that--

Michael Meeropol: Oh yeah, absolutely. It was terrible, you know? But it was-- it was honest. I mean basically, I was pissed off, because they were kissing us goodbye like, ""See you next time."" And I thought, you know, ""They-- they should take-- make th-- a more big deal about this. 'Cause this could be forever.""

The attorney general said the couple could still save themselves by providing information to investigators. But Julius and Ethel Rosenberg remained united in silence. As the hours of execution approached, reporters converged on the prison, and protestors gathered near New York's Union Square. Robby and Michael, now 6 and 10 years old, stayed at the home of a family friend in New Jersey, playing baseball and hoping for a last minute reprieve, which never came.

Michael Meeropol: I played catch 'till it was too dark to see the ball. And when I came in, I asked the adults what happened. And they wouldn't tell me. They just said, ""We listened to every radio station. They all said the same thing."" And so I knew. I got hugged by the woman who we were staying with. And she said, ""You'll stay with us."" And I said, ""Yeah, I guess I will."" And-- they said, ""Let's keep it from Robby."" And so I kept it from him for a week.

Anderson Cooper: For a week?

Michael Meeropol: Yeah. Well, I couldn't, I just couldn't-- for what reason or another, I just couldn't go on with the charade.

Anderson Cooper: Do you remember exactly what you said?

Michael Meeropol: Yeah. 'Cause he was talking about, ""When Mommy and Daddy come home."" And I said, ""Oh, come on, let's tell him….Rob, Robby…""-- he was always Robby --""Mommy and Daddy aren't coming home. They're dead.""

Anderson Cooper: Do you remember what he said?

Michael Meeropol: He acted as if he didn't understand.

Robert Meeropol: I think I've had to work my entire life at reacting to bad news, 'cause my first tendency whenever bad news comes is to pretend like it's not that bad somehow. And, you know, if you can do that with your parents being executed, you can do that with almost anything.

The Rosenberg's supporters viewed them as martyrs persecuted for their Communist belief. But to the vast majority of Americans, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were atomic spies and traitors. Many believed they deserved to die.

Michael Meeropol: When my parents were killed, an-- a postcard came to the place I was staying. And it said, ""Of course you feel for the loss of your parents, but when you think of all the boys they killed in Korea, you must realize that justice was done. Why don't you change your names and become Christians?""

Anderson Cooper: And you remember the words to this day?

Michael Meeropol: Well, those are the kind of words that you don't forget.

Anderson Cooper: In so many of the photos of you both at that time, your brother is-- his arm is around you or both arms are around you like he's protecting you.

Robert Meeropol: He was my anchor, you know, rather than sibling rivalry, it was more of, like, the two of us against the world.

Anderson Cooper: Who do you think this was harder on? You or Robby?

Michael Meeropol: I think it probably was much harder on Robby, because three years with my parents, what are his memories? He has very little to grab onto.

Robert Meeropol: I think it was harder on him. I think he had a tremendous sense of responsibility for me. And he understood more.

It had been quite a while since anything good had happened to the Rosbenberg boys. But in 1953, not long after their parents' funeral, they were introduced to Anne and Abel Meeropol, teachers who were supporters of the Rosenbergs. They took Michael and Robby into their home and eventually adopted them.

[Dictaphone recording: Introducing the Meeropol family….Robby Meeropol and yours truly! [singing] This land is your land, this land is my land…]

Anderson Cooper: The Meeropols became your parents?

Michael Meeropol: Absolutely. Totally.

Anderson Cooper: They changed your life?

Michael Meeropol: Yeah. They saved our lives.

Robert Meeropol: Within a few months of living with them, I was calling them Mommy and Daddy.

Anderson Cooper: Was it your choice to take their name?

Robert Meeropol: Well, I was too young to really have a choice. But it made us more anonymous. And that was a good thing.

As Michael and Robby Meeropol, they eventually went to college, got married, and started raising families of their own.

Robert Meeropol: I think it's no accident that both of us got married when we were young. That we both had two kids, just like we were two kids. As early as we could, we recreated the family that was torn apart.

Michael Meeropol became an economics professor. Robert, a lawyer and founder of a charity called the Rosenberg Fund for Children. They lived relatively normal lives. But for many years, most of the people they interacted with each day had no idea they were the children of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.

Robert Meeropol: Essentially, I was in the closet from when I was 6 until when I was 20 with everybody who didn't already know.

Anderson Cooper: You were worried about letting the world know who you were?

Robert Meeropol: Yeah, I was, because whenever-- when the world knew who I was, it was very bad. Terrible things happened.

More than 20 years after their parents' execution, the brothers decided to step back into the limelight and reinvestigate the Rosenberg case. What they discovered when we come back.

Before Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed for conspiring to provide atomic secrets to the Soviet Union, Ethel wrote a letter to their sons Michael and Robby saying, ""always remember that we were innocent."" So perhaps it's not surprising that when the boys grew up, they wanted to try to clear their parents' names. What is surprising is how much new information they and independent historians have been able to uncover over the years -- secret messages, intercepted cables, long-forgotten files from the archives of the FBI, the CIA, and the KGB. The new information has changed the way this chapter of American history is viewed and, last year, the brothers asked President Obama to exonerate their mother.

The little boys who disappeared from public view after their parents were executed in 1953, re-emerged as grown men in 1975 determined to uncover new information in their parents case. They sued the FBI and the CIA under the Freedom of Information Act, seeking full access to the government's files on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.

[Robert Meeropol at press conference: The government files represent the largest body of primary evidence on my parents' case in existence. We are not afraid of what is in them. Why is the government afraid? What are they trying to cover up?]

Anderson Cooper: Did you think you might be able to prove your parents' innocence?

Michael Meeropol: Oh, absolutely. I was absolutely convinced that we would find virtual proof.

Anderson Cooper: You were sure they were innocent?

Robert Meeropol: As sure as one-and-one equal two.

They formed a committee to re-examine the Rosenberg case. Ron Radosh was among the first to sign up. At the time, he was an author and activist, highly sympathetic to the Rosenbergs' cause and eager to help.

Ron Radosh: By then I had a phD in history and I believed, my expertise as a historian enabled me to want to go through all these files that I expected would prove their innocence.

But once Ron Radosh started going through the FBI files, he realized he was wrong: Julius Rosenberg had been a Soviet spy -- and a zealous recruiter of others.

Ron Radosh: I was stunned. It became readily apparent, that this was not people who were arrested because they opposed the Korean War or whatever, because they wanted peace.

Anderson Cooper: Essentially--

Ron Radosh: So--

Anderson Cooper: --Julius Rosenberg's job was as a recruiter of others? He was--

Ron Radosh: Right, he--

Anderson Cooper: --developing a network--

Ron Radosh: --ran a network. He put it together and handled them all.

In 1983, Ron Radosh co-wrote a book outlining the new evidence that Julius Rosenberg was guilty.

Anderson Cooper: How did the Meeropols and others on the left respond?

Ron Radosh: Horrendously. I mean, I was ostracized, attacked.

Anderson Cooper: People stopped speaking to you?

Ron Radosh: Yeah. I had phone calls in the middle of the night, death threats, the usual thing. I mean-- and we lost-- actually lost good friends, very good friends. Who no longer stopped talking to us, and to this day.

Anderson Cooper: To this day?

Ron Radosh: Oh, absolutely.

It took Michael and Robby a long time to accept that their father was guilty. They finally acknowledged it in 2008, when their parents' co-defendant Morty Sobell admitted for the first time he had been part of Julius Rosenberg's spy ring.

Anderson Cooper: Was there any part of you that was disappointed in your father?

Michael Meeropol: No. No. Not at all.

Anderson Cooper: Not disappointed that he actually did commit espionage?

Michael Meeropol: I'll speak for myself. No, I-- I didn't.

Robert Meeropol: You know, for years we were saying our parents were innocent lambs brought to slaughter. And to come to the realization that, instead, they were knowing political actors who made decisions based upon their beliefs, I actually found that to be more palatable. I didn't want them to just be victims.

Anderson Cooper: But your father was breaking U.S. law--

Michael Meeropol: Absolutely.

Anderson Cooper: --to do this. So--

Michael Meeropol: Yeah, he was.

Robert Meeropol: And I think that if he'd been arrested and given a five or 10-year prison sentence, we would have nothing to complain about.

There's now plenty of evidence that Julius Rosenberg's spy network stole important technology for jet fighters, radar, and detonators. But the one thing he and his spies didn't do a very good job of stealing was atomic secrets – the heart of the prosecutors' case. Most historians agree that the Soviets got the most important atomic bomb-making information from Los Alamos scientists Klaus Fuchs and Theodore Hall, who belonged to a different Russian spy ring.

The Los Alamos informant Julius was accused of recruiting, Ethel's brother David Greenglass, was a machinist, not a scientist. When a copy of the sketch Greenglass said he drew for the Soviets was made public in 1966, nuclear scientists were not impressed.

Michael Meeropol: 1966, top scientists look at it, and they make it clear that this thing is a secret of nothing. It's got no dimensions in it. It's got errors in it.

Newspapers called Julius and Ethel Rosenberg ""atomic spies"" and the judge sentenced them to death for putting the atomic bomb in the hands of the Soviet Union. But there's ample evidence the U.S. government knew at the time that the information David Greenglass gave to the Soviets was of minor value.

Anderson Cooper: The prosecutors knew the information the Rosenbergs had access to was not the-- the crown jewels of the atomic world?

Ron Radosh: Yes. But they were pushing for a prosecution without using the hardest evidence they could-- they had. Couldn't be used.

That's because in the 1940s the U.S. government had been secretly intercepting Soviet messages, and it didn't want the Soviets to know it had broken their code. So instead, prosecutors pressured David Greenglass and his wife Ruth, to testify against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Michael and Robby argue that prosecutors framed their mother by inventing evidence that she typed up David Greenglass' notes on the atomic bomb.

[Greenglass: Where do I sit? Right there?]

[Voice [off camera]: Yes, sir.]

In 2001, half a century after he testified that his sister typed up his notes, David Greenglass told 60 Minutes correspondent Bob Simon it was a lie.

Bob Simon: So Ethel finally went to the electric chair on the basis of evidence that was false.

David Greenglass: False.

He said he did it to save himself and his wife, and he showed little remorse.

David Greenglass: We're still here. I didn't have to go away, nobody killed me and I survived.

Bob Simon: Your sister didn't.

David Greenglass: You know, I'd like to say something: I would not sacrifice my wife and my children for my sister. How do you like that? My wife is more important to me than my sister.

Greenglass said he was pressed to give this false testimony by one of the prosecutors in the case, Roy Cohn, who would go on to become Senator Joseph McCarthy's right-hand man and was later disbarred for unethical conduct.

Bob Simon: Did Cohn encourage you to testify that you saw Ethel typing up the notes?

David Greenglass: Of course, he did.

As a reward for their testimony against the Rosenbergs, David Greenglass got a reduced sentence and his wife Ruth, who had served as a Soviet courrier, never spent a day in prison. Prosecutors believed the prospect of Ethel dying in the electric chair, would force Julius Rosenberg to confess and name other Soviet spies.

Michael Meeropol: In the case of my mother, she really is collateral damage, you know, this is -- this is the government trying…putting a gun to her head and saying to Julie ""Talk or we'll kill her.""

Anderson Cooper: You don't think she was involved at all?

Michael Meeropol: We don't believe that, and in fact we believe that the evidence has virtually proved that.

After David and Ruth Greenglass died, their testimony to a grand jury before the Rosenberg's trial was unsealed. There was no mention of Ethel Rosenberg typing up David Greenglass' notes and when those Soviet messages the U.S. had been secretly decoding were publicly released, they showed the Soviets had never given Ethel Rosenberg a code name. In 1997, when Julius Rosenberg's former Soviet handler Alexander Feklisov went public with tales of Julius' spy missions for the Soviet Union, Feklisov had this to say about Ethel Rosenberg:

Alexander Feklisov: Ethel never worked for us. She didn't do anything.

Based on this information, Robert and Michael Meeropol launched a campaign to clear their mother's name. In 2015, they got 13 members of the New York City Council to issue a proclamation declaring the government wrongfully executed Ethel Rosenberg.

Robert Meeropol: It is time for the federal government to step up and do the same.

Last year, they've launched an online petition drive, callling on President Obama to exonerate their mother before he leaves office. But historian Ron Radosh says, based on the documents he's seen, that would be a mistake.

Ron Radosh: She was an accessory to spying by helping, identifying people, urging people to be recruited, suggesting that her own brother be recruited, this is aiding those who are spying. It's aiding and abetting.

Anderson Cooper: You're saying even though she wasn't as involved as her husband, she still engaged in a conspiracy--

Ron Radosh: Yes. She considered herself a friend of the Soviet Union, was doing-- helping her husband in his valuable work.

Anderson Cooper: So the trial was not fair, but that doesn't mean the Rosenbergs were innocent--

Ron Radosh: Right. Right. You could say-- if you want to say those who say the Rosenbergs were framed, they framed guilty people.

Anderson Cooper: But you are acknowledging there was an injustice when it comes to Ethel in terms of the death penalty?

Ron Radosh: Yes. Yeah. Sh-- compared to the others, she was of minimal importance. She should not have been executed. The government did it as a mechanism of leverage, hoping that would push Julius to talk. It didn't work. And I think they were shocked that it didn't work. I th-- they all thought Julius would break and cooperate.

Anderson Cooper: When Judge Kaufman sentenced them to death, he said the Rosenbergs loved their cause more than their children. Do you think that's true?

Ron Radosh: Yes. Unfortunately, I would agree with that. Yes. Otherwise, how could they have done what they did?

Anderson Cooper: You've said that your mother was a hostage who was killed when your father wouldn't talk. Isn't it true though that she could have told investigators everything she knew and lived?

Robert Meeropol: Both our parents could've saved themselves.

Michael Meeropol: No question--

Robert Meeropol: The F.B.I. agents who've written memoires in which they said, ""We didn't want them to die. We wanted them to talk.""

Anderson Cooper: After your father had been executed, could she have then--

Michael Meeropol: Absolutely.

Anderson Cooper: --last minute--

Michael Meeropol: Exac--

Anderson Cooper: --said, ""You know what? I'll tell you everything I know""?

Michael Meeropol: Absolutely. In fact, we know that the rabbi came to her cell after witnessing our father's execution and said, ""Julius is gone and, you know, you have two children. And if there's anything you can say, a name, even a false name, just anything, you know, to save yourself."" And allegedly, she said to the rabbi, ""I have no names. I'm innocent and I'm ready.""

Robert Meeropol: Ultimately, they couldn't betray each other. They couldn't and they would not betray each other. And that would've been the ultimate betrayal.

""...the fact that the government facilitated the invention of evidence in order to convict someone of a capital crime, that is something that should concern everybody.""

Anderson Cooper: Do you feel she betrayed you?

Robert Meeropol: N-- not at all.

Anderson Cooper: The judge said, ""Your parents loved their cause more than their own children,"" which is certainly a very cruel thing to say--

Robert Meeropol: And it's not true.

Anderson Cooper: You don't believe by--

Robert Meeropol: I don't--

Anderson Cooper: --by choosing to die rather than cooperate, they didn't prove the judge right?

Robert Meeropol: No, I don't think they did. If you were interviewing us in a psychiatric ward-- then you might say, ""Yeah-- they-- they damaged us by what they did.""

Anderson Cooper: To you exoneration would mean what? Is it political or is it personal?

Michael Meeropol: Both.

Robert Meeropol: Oh, it's both. Our mother was killed for something she did not do. She was taken away from us. That's as personal as it can get. But, the fact that the government facilitated the invention of evidence in order to convict someone of a capital crime, that is something that should concern everybody.

Since our story first aired, more than 50,000 people signed an online petition calling for Ethel Rosenberg to be exonerated. In December, the brothers went to the gates of the White House to plead their case, just as they had done as boys. But President Obama never responded to their request, and the brothers told us they don't plan on asking President Trump.

224,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/senators-recorded-on-hot-mic-im-worried/,cbsnews,Senators recorded on hot mic: “I’m worried”,['Blair Guild'],"Two senators were complaining that the White House is paying insufficient attention to the budget process, apparently unaware that their microphones were still on after a Senate subcommittee meeting Tuesday.

Sen. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, began discussing federal budget proposals.

""I swear, [the Office of Management and Budget] just went through and whenever there was 'grant,' they just X it out,"" Collins said. ""With no measurement, no thinking about it, no metrics, no nothing. It's just incredibly irresponsible.""

""Yes, I think — I think he's crazy,"" Reed said. ""I mean, I don't say that lightly and as a kind of a goofy guy.""

When asked later by CBS News' Rebecca Kaplan if he was referring to President Trump, Reed replied, ""I was talking about the budget legislation."" He did not elaborate. CBS News reached out to Reed's office for more clarification, which responded, ""They are talking about budget demands.""

The hot mic recording continued with Collins' reply: ""I'm worried,"" she says.

""Oof,"" Reed sighs. ""You know, this thing — if we don't get a budget deal, we're going to be paralyzed.""

""I know,"" Collins said.

""[Department of Defense] is going to be paralyzed, everybody is going to be paralyzed,"" Reed replies.

""I don't think he knows there is a [Budget Control Act] or anything,"" Collins said in reference to a law outlining the budget process.

If Democrats and Republicans cannot reach a budget agreement, as Collins mentioned, there will be across-the-board cuts to discretionary spending, because of the Budget Control Act, passed in 2011. And that agreement requires 60 votes.

""He was down at the Ford commissioning,"" Reed says, apparently talking about Mr. Trump's recent announcement regarding a Navy aircraft carrier, ""saying, 'I want them to pass my budget.' Okay, so we give him $54 billion and then we take it away across the board which would cause chaos.""

""Right,"" Collins said.

""It's just — and he hasn't — not one word about the budget. Not one word about the debt ceiling,"" Reed said.

""Good point,"" Collins replies. The debt ceiling must be raised likely by mid-October or the U.S. risks defaulting on its debt.

""You've got [Budget Director Mick] Mulvaney saying we're going to put in all sorts of stuff like a border wall. Then you've got [Treasury Secretary Steve] Mnuchin saying it's got to be clean,"" Reed continues. ""We're going to be back in September, and, you know, you're going to have crazy people in the House.""

Following this point in the conversation between the two senators, they began discussing Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas. Recently, Farenthold said in a radio interview that if Collins were not a female, he could challenge her to a ""duel,"" citing frustration with Collins' opposition to the Senate health care bill aimed at repealing Obamacare.

""Did you see the one who challenged me to a duel?"" Collins asked Reed.

""I know, trust me, do you know why he challenged you to a duel? 'Cause you could beat the s**t out of him,"" Reed joked.

""Well, he's huge and he — I don't mean to be unkind, but he's so unattractive it's unbelievable,"" Collins said of Farenthold. ""Did you see the picture of him in his pajamas next to this Playboy bunny?"" she continued, referencing a photo of Farenthold wearing a matching pajama set with rubber ducks while standing next to a scantily-clad young woman.

The recording of the conversation between the two senators conversation ended after this comment."

Stars Matthew McConaughey, who plays rags-to-riches businessman Kenny Wells, and Bryce Dallas Howard, who plays Kenny’s girlfriend Kay, talked to CBS News about what got them excited for their roles when they read the script.

McConaughey said he was attracted to Wells’ scrappiness.

In the film, Wells is a bald and paunchy down-on-his-luck businessman who has a dream about finding gold. The prospector is determined to make good on his dream and dig for gold with his partner, geologist Michael Acosta, in Indonesia and comes up against a few big-time Wall Street investors along the way.

“This guy, Kenny Wells, is chasing down this dream that he literally had -- chasing down a literal dream that he had -- believing in it it all the way to the death. He would die for this dream. And that’s how he lives. He would cheat death to achieve this dream,” said McConaughey. “What a pure spirit, too -- a guy who has no trouble turning down $300 million to buy out his company but yet can barely speak and is sweating when he’s going to receive Prospector of the Year award in front of his friends in Reno, Nevada. That’s a pure soul.”

McConaughey added that he can relate to Wells in that he never allows himself to rest on his laurels: “On a daily basis, I know I’ve got work to do. I know I’ve got places where I can improve.”

In contrast, Howard said what attracted her most to the role of Kay was her satisfaction with her life. In the film, Kay, who has stayed with Wells through all of his low points, proves to be far tougher than she appears.

“I loved that we weren’t seeing a woman who’s dissatisfied,” said Howard. “We’re seeing a woman who’s fulfilled in her life and it’s Kenny, really, who’s figuring things out.”

México se ha convertido en refugio de venezolanos. Durante los primeros cinco meses del 2017, ingresaron a 33 mil 985 habitantes de esa nación a territorio azteca. Así lo revela Unidad de Políticas Migratorias de la Secretaría de Gobernación.

Esto significa que todos los días entran a nuestra nación 226 venezolanos.

Orillados por la crisis que vive su país, miles decidieron quedarse en México, ya sea como ilegales, refugiados o residentes temporales.

José Arévalo es uno de ellos. Al llegar a la Ciudad de México halló un empleo informal como repartidor de alimentos, pero después acudió a la Comisión Mexicana de Ayuda a Refugiados (COMAR) y ya recibió oficialmente asilo político.

Cuenta a Uno TV que el documento que le fue entregado ""te da un salvoconducto de estadía legal dentro del territorio mexicano, con permiso de trabajo y CURP"".

La estrategia legal utilizada por José se disparó recientemente. Durante el primer semestre de 2017 se triplicó el número de solicitudes de refugio.

En el año 2015, la comisión recibió apenas 57 solicitudes de venezolanos. En el 2016 fueron 361, pero en lo que va de 2017, ha recibido mil 420 peticiones. Hasta ahora ha otorgado 674 permisos humanitarios.

En lo que va de este año, otros 2 mil 333 han optado por pedir tarjetas de residencia temporal ante el Instituto Nacional de Migración.

El perfil de quienes huyen de la crisis venezolana es variado. Por ejemplo, María Pura Imhof es historiadora. Llegó a México hace algunos meses y aquí trabaja en campañas publicitarias. Cuenta a UnoTV que a los mexicanos les causa curiosidad el método de gobierno de Nicolás Maduro.

Cuando le consultan respecto a temas políticos de Venezuela, su advertencia es muy clara: ""Pero lo que sí les puedo decir a los mexicanos y a las mexicanas es que lean y se informen y que no se dejen enamorar por la poesía política de un líder populista"".

Los refugiados en México, por ahora, descartan regresar a su país; en donde la crisis se agudiza día a día.

Con Uno, Juan Rivas."

232,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/they-kept-us-as-slaves-ap-report-reveals-claims-against-church/,cbsnews,"""They kept us as slaves"": AP report reveals claims against church",['Crimesider Staff'],"SPINDALE, N.C. -- When Andre Oliveira answered the call to leave his Word of Faith Fellowship congregation in Brazil to move to the mother church in North Carolina at the age of 18, his passport and money were confiscated by church leaders -- for safekeeping, he said he was told.

Trapped in a foreign land, he said he was forced to work 15 hours a day, usually for no pay, first cleaning warehouses for the secretive evangelical church and later toiling at businesses owned by senior ministers. Any deviation from the rules risked the wrath of church leaders, he said, ranging from beatings to shaming from the pulpit.

""They trafficked us up here. They knew what they were doing. They needed labor and we were cheap labor -- hell, free labor,"" Oliveira said.

An Associated Press investigation has found that Word of Faith Fellowship used its two church branches in Latin America's largest nation to siphon a steady flow of young laborers who came on tourist and student visas to its 35-acre compound in rural Spindale.

Under U.S. law, visitors on tourist visas are prohibited from performing work for which people normally would be compensated. Those on student visas are allowed some work, under circumstances that were not met at Word of Faith Fellowship, the AP found.

On at least one occasion, former members alerted authorities. In 2014, three ex-congregants told an assistant U.S. attorney that the Brazilians were being forced to work for no pay, according to a recording obtained by the AP.

""And do they beat up the Brazilians?"" Jill Rose, now the U.S. attorney in Charlotte, asked.

""Most definitely,"" one of the former congregants responded. Ministers ""mostly bring them up here for free work,"" another said.

Though Rose could be heard promising to look into it, the former members said she never responded when they repeatedly tried to contact her in the months after the meeting.

Rose declined to comment to the AP, citing an ongoing investigation.

Oliveira, who fled the church last year, is one of 16 Brazilian former members who told the AP they were forced to work, often for no pay, and physically or verbally assaulted. The AP also reviewed scores of police reports and formal complaints lodged in Brazil about the church's harsh conditions.

""They kept us as slaves,"" Oliveira said, pausing at times to wipe away tears. ""We were expendable. We meant nothing to them. Nothing. How can you do that to people -- claim you love them and then beat them in the name of God?""

The Brazilians often spoke little English when they arrived, and many had their passports seized.

Many males worked in construction; many females worked as babysitters and in the church's K-12 school, the former members said. One ex-congregant from Brazil told AP she was only 12 the first time she was put to work.

Although immigration officials in both countries said it was impossible to calculate the volume of the human pipeline, at least several hundred young Brazilians have migrated to North Carolina over the past two decades, based on interviews with former members.

The revelations of forced labor are the latest in an ongoing AP investigation exposing years of abuse at Word of Faith Fellowship. Based on exclusive interviews with 43 former members, documents and secretly made recordings, the AP reported in February that congregants were regularly punched, smacked and choked in an effort to ""purify"" sinners by beating out devils.

The church has rarely been sanctioned since it was founded in 1979 by sect leader Jane Whaley, a former math teacher, and her husband, Sam. Another previous AP report outlined how congregants were ordered by church leaders to lie to authorities investigating reports of abuse.

The AP made repeated attempts to obtain comments for this story from church leaders in both countries, but they did not respond.

Under Jane Whaley's leadership, Word of Faith Fellowship grew from a handful of followers to about 750 congregants in North Carolina and a total of nearly 2,000 members in its churches in Brazil and Ghana and its affiliations in Sweden, Scotland and other countries.

Members visit the Spindale compound from around the world, but Brazil is the biggest source of foreign labor and Whaley and her top lieutenants visit the Brazilian outposts several times a year, the AP found.

Former member Thiago Silva said he was excited when he boarded a plane in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte to fly to a Word of Faith youth seminar in North Carolina in 2001. He was 18 and expecting to use his tourist visa to meet new people and visit the U.S.

He soon learned, he said, that there would be ""no happiness.""

""Brazilians came here for labor. I'm telling you, that's it,"" Silva said. He called the treatment ""a violation of human rights.""

Silva, now 34, recounted being among a group of Brazilians working alongside Americans -- the locals were paid, the Brazilians were not, he said.

Silva and others also said Whaley took complete control of congregants' lives on both continents, mandating such daily staples of life as where they lived and when they could eat -- and even forcing some into arranged marriages to Americans so they could stay in the country.

The lack of freedom was pervasive, they said: Silva, for example, said he could phone his parents from the U.S only if someone who spoke Portuguese monitored the call.

""There's no free will,"" he said. ""There's Jane's will.""

""I suffered so much there""

Over the course of two decades, Word of Faith Fellowship absorbed two churches in Brazil, in the southeastern cities of Sao Joaquim de Bicas and Franco da Rocha.

During her frequent visits, Whaley would tell the Brazilian members of her flock that they could improve both their lives and their relationships with God with a pilgrimage to the mother church, according to several of those interviewed. The Brazilians' brand of worship was inferior, she often would say.

In addition to being promised a higher standing in the church, some said they also were enticed with the chance to attend college, to learn English, to see a bit of the U.S.

Others said they felt they simply had no choice.

All the while, the strict rules in place in Spindale were being imposed in Brazil, leading to complaints to police reviewed by the AP and a legislative hearing in 2009. But Word of Faith never faced any official censure -- many of the allegations came down to the word of ex-members against the church -- and the human pipeline continued to flow, even as Brazilian parents said they were being completely cut off from their children in North Carolina.

Labeled a ""rebel"" because she talked back to pastors as a child, Elizabeth Oliveira, who is no relation to Andre, told the AP that she was frequently kept in isolation for days at a time in various ministers' homes in Sao Joaquim de Bicas.

Being sent to the U.S. was a way to ""correct"" her bad behavior. She said she was 12 when she made her first extended trip to Spindale and was immediately put to work. She helped out in the school during the day, then sewed clothes and babysat in the evenings, sometimes well past midnight, Oliveira said. She was never paid, she said.

Now 21 and studying medicine in Belo Horizonte, Oliveira said she broke with the church after her eighth trip to Spindale.

""I suffered so much there,"" she said. ""When I turned 18, I left and was told, once again, that I would die on my own in the world and go to hell.""

Ana Albuquerque traveled to Spindale from Brazil 11 times over the course of more than a decade, starting at age 5 with her parents. Over time, she said she witnessed so much screaming and shoving to ""expunge devils"" that she began to see the behavior as normal.

In her final three trips, she joined a group of two dozen other Brazilian teens staying up to six months under tourist visas.

""They come to you and say, 'You will get to know the United States of America. You will get to go to the malls,'"" she said. ""But when you get there, everything is controlled.""

Albuquerque, now 25, said she worked full time without pay -- as a teacher's aide at the school during the day and then babysitting congregants' children at night.

Her reckoning came during her final trip, when she was 16. Albuquerque said Whaley and another minister repeatedly spanked her with a flat piece of wood while screaming that she was ""unclean"" and possessed by the devil.

""Pray for it to come out of you!"" Albuquerque recalled being exhorted during a session lasting 40 minutes.

During her final two weeks in Spindale, Albuquerque said she endured days of forced isolation, Bible reading, threats of being placed in a psychiatric ward and refusals by Whaley to let her call her parents. She finally was allowed to return to Brazil, where she left the church.

Luiz Pires said he was 18 in 2006 when he was encouraged by ministers in the Sao Joaquim de Bicas church to travel to North Carolina for his spiritual betterment.

Upon arrival, he said he found ""horrific"" living conditions, with eight people crammed in the basement of a church leader's house, forced to work long hours at church-related businesses. Any payment went to living expenses, Pires said, despite the fact that he and others cleaned and did yard work at the member's house where they lived.

""There was never time to sit down. We were worked like slaves,"" he said.

Former congregant Jay Plummer supervised remodeling projects for a church leader's business and confirmed that his fellow American workers were paid while the Brazilians who labored alongside them were not.

""Room and board is what they worked for, and they did not have a choice,"" Plummer told the AP. ""And when they would not want to work and vocalize that, they would just get in trouble.""

Paulo Henrique Barbosa had heard the horror stories about life in Spindale. But the sect's influence was so great that he said he felt he must comply when church leaders in Franco da Rocha -- supported by his parents -- told him to travel to Spindale in 2011, when he was 17.

Pastors told him he would violate God's will if he refused.

""Everybody knew these trips were not about tourism,"" said Barbosa, now 23 and working in information technology in Sao Paolo. ""I didn't want to go, but I had no choice.""

Once in Spindale, conditions were worse than he feared, he said: For six months, he helped in the school in the mornings and worked in construction in the afternoons and evenings, sometimes until 1 a.m. He was never paid, he said.

The church controlled everything he did, Barbosa said, even prohibiting snacks between meals. Television, music and certain brand-name products all were off-limits.

Barbosa said he also slept in a church member's basement, with about 15 other young males. Speaking Portuguese was forbidden.

Anyone in the bathroom for more than the mandated five minutes was suspected of committing the ""sin"" of masturbation, and Whaley would be called to the house to decree the punishment.

If any of the males appeared to be having an ""impure dream,"" Barbosa said, everybody would be awakened, ordered to surround him and repeatedly shake him and shriek into his ears to ""expulse the devils,"" a Word of Faith practice called ""blasting.""

Barbosa said he asked to return to Brazil many times ""but they always told me no, that it was God's will for me to stay.""

Leaving on his own seemed insurmountable, Barbosa said. He had flown into Charlotte, more than an hour from Spindale, and had no car and little money. He knew no one outside the church and did not speak English. He was allowed to return to Brazil only when his six-month tourist visa was set to expire.

""From the time you are a kid, you are trained to believe that leaving the church will mean you go to hell, get cancer or get AIDS,"" he said.

Visa violations

The AP investigation documented repeated abuses of the tourist and student visas obtained for Brazilian church members.

Brazilians most often first arrived in North Carolina on six-month tourist visas for church functions, sometimes 20 or 30 at a time. Some Brazilians would leave after a few weeks; others would stay the duration.

Perhaps to circumvent the rules against employment, church leaders sometimes referred to the forced labor projects as ""volunteer work,"" according to Brazilians interviewed in both countries.

Such work included ripping out walls and installing drywall in apartments owned and rented out by a senior church minister and family members, they said.

Ross Eisenbrey of the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank focusing on labor issues, said rental properties are ""for-profit businesses for which the immigrants cannot volunteer"" under the Fair Labor Standards Act.

Some of those interviewed said they'd been lured to the U.S. in part by promises of obtaining a college education but were unable to study or attend classes because of their punishing work schedules.

""There were times I would get done at 4 in the morning and I knew I had to get up by 8 to go to work. I would sit there, staring at my books. But how can you concentrate? You're just too tired,"" Andre Oliveira said.

Former congregants said far more Brazilians came on tourist visas, with several hundred teenagers staying for extended periods.

The experience of Andre Oliveira, now 24, is illustrative.

After first traveling to Spindale in 2009, he said it took him months to obtain permission to return to Brazil. Back home, he said he and others were forced to move into a minister's house, where he worked as a cleaner for months until he was told ""it was the will of God to visit Spindale -- this time, on a student visa.""

When he arrived back in North Carolina, ministers again took his passport and put him to work in companies owned by church ministers, he said. He took a few college classes, but didn't have time to study.

""A typical day would start like this: I'd start work at 9 in the morning and it would end 15 or 16 hours later -- sometimes longer,"" he said. ""We didn't stop.""

Oliveira and others said they had little choice but to follow orders.

""We knew what would happen: We would be screamed at, blasted, hit. And what are you going to do? You have nowhere to go. You don't know the language. You have no documentation. So you work,"" Oliveira said.

""It was slave labor,"" added Rebeca Melo, 29, who grew up in the church in Brazil and visited the U.S. about 10 times for religious functions and trips with her family.

Those visits included shopping excursions, but she said things were far different when she moved to Spindale on a student visa in 2009.

""I did not want to move here. Jane said it was the will of God,"" she told the AP.

Melo said her passport was taken and she was quickly put to work. Despite her student visa, church officials were clear that school was not to be her focus, she said.

Student visas were just a ""means for us to be here legally,"" she said.

Arranged marriages

Whaley's brand of ""love"" also played a key role in enticing Brazilian males to Spindale -- and keeping them there once their visas expired, according to 10 former members of the church.

Some of those interviewed spoke of male Brazilians -- as well as church members from various other countries -- obtaining green cards for permanent residency and being able to legally work by being ""married off"" to female American congregants.

It is illegal to enter a sham marriage for the purpose of avoiding U.S. immigration laws.

The arranged marriages also addressed the fact that the Spindale congregation has more unmarried females than males, the ex-members said. Under Whaley's rules, congregants aren't allowed to date outside the church, much less marry.

""I can count at least five or six Brazilian guys that moved here to marry an American girl,"" Melo said. ""They would never, ever, ever consider letting you date somebody outside of the church.""

Silva said that Whaley often told people that she heard from God who they should marry or used her iron grip over members' lives to arrange relationships.

Silva recalled a young Brazilian couple in love who would be unable to stay in the U.S. past their visas if they married. Whaley wanted to keep the man in Spindale so she told him it was the ""will of God"" for him to marry an American, Silva said.

With his visa time running down, Andre Oliveira said church leaders found him a bride.

It wasn't long after former member Kim Rooper joined the Spindale church that she said she was asked to marry a man from Ecuador whose visa was expiring.

Rooper, an American who now lives in Tampa, Florida, said she was coached on how to make the marriage look legitimate to immigration authorities, like keeping a photo album of the couple.

""Long story short, it came time to consummate the marriage and I struggled with that,"" she said. ""I had a hard time because I didn't love him, and nor did I have an attraction to him.""

Church leaders told her it was the ""will of God"" to submit to her husband, Rooper said.

""And that's when I knew I had to escape,"" she said.

John Lewis, Comic-Con had something for almost every pop-culture appetite.

As the annual fan convention in San Diego wraps Sunday after four days of panels, presentations, screenings and autograph signings, here's a look at some of the highlights.

Black Panther

The film won't be out until February 2018, but ""Black Panther"" swiped the most attention at Marvel's presentation. Director Ryan Coogler and cast members Chadwick Boseman, Lupita Nyong'o, Andy Serkis and Danai Gurira were on hand to debut a clip from the film.

Boseman, who introduced his Black Panther character in 2016's ""Captain America: Civil War,"" said the new film finds him returning to his home of Wakanda after his father dies. Nyong'o described her character as a spy who goes undercover to report back to the fictional isolated nation about what is going on in the rest of the world.

Marvel's presentation also included early looks at the November release ""Thor: Ragnarok"" and next year's ""Avengers: Infinity War."" And studio chief Kevin Feige announced that Michelle Pfeiffer was cast in the ""Ant-Man"" sequel ""Ant-Man and the Wasp,"" also due in 2018.

Wonder Woman ... part deux

As of Sunday, the superhero pic is now the highest-grossing film of the summer with $398 million from North American theaters, and the sequel is official. Warner Bros. is not saying much about the inevitable follow-up to the smash hit, but the studio did flash a title card with the words ""Wonder Woman II"" during its Comic-Con presentation Saturday.

But that was the extent of the ""Wonder Woman II"" talk at the fan convention. There is no official word on whether or not Patty Jenkins will return to direct, who is penning the script or even when the film might hit theaters.

Not even Gal Gadot mentioned it during the Comic-Con ""Justice League"" panel.

Reuters

Batman

There was a lot of Batman at Comic-Con, from Ben Affleck's confirmation that he'll continue to play the character to a star-filled tribute to the original ""Batman"" actor, Adam West.

Affleck refuted rumors that he would no longer play the character after ceding direction of ""The Batman"" to ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" director Matt Reeves. The actor also appeared alongside some of his ""Justice League"" costars, including Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman), Jason Momoa (Aquaman), Ezra Miller (The Flash) and Ray Fisher (Cyborg) as they showed footage from the film due in November.

West was celebrated by his fans and collaborators at a heartfelt tribute that featured Kevin Smith, producer James Tucker, actor Ralph Garman and ""Catwoman"" actress Lee Meriwether. Smith said he learned morality from West's portrayal of Batman in the original TV series, and Meriwether said she was so dazzled by the actor during the making of ""Batman: The Movie"" that she nearly lost track of her performance - especially during a ballroom scene where they danced together.

""All I could think of was, 'I'm dancing with Adam West,' "" she said. ""I probably blew one take and then I snapped out of it.""

Stranger Things

The popular Netflix show took over the San Diego Convention Center's largest exhibition hall to debut a new trailer for its anticipated second season. The show, set in the early 1980s, follows a group of kids trying to figure out how their friend mysteriously disappeared. Along the way, they meet an unusual girl named Eleven, who has telepathic powers.

Show creators the Duffer Bros. were joined by director Shawn Levy and star Millie Bobby Brown (Eleven) and the other young actors in the ensemble: Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin and Noah Schnapp.

""Stranger Things"" also had a presence in downtown San Diego with an installation that resembled the show's set and a virtual-reality experience that brought guests into the home of the missing boy and face to face with the monster that haunts him.

Blade Runner 2049

Harrison Ford joked that he was out to reboot all of his iconic roles. The actor was on hand to present footage from ""Blade Runner 2049,"" in which he reprises his role as Rick Deckard. Ford said he gained a deeper understanding of his character in the sequel, which hits theaters in October.

Ford appeared alongside costar Ryan Gosling at the film's panel.

""Blade Runner 2049"" also hosted a massive installation away from the San Diego Convention Center where fans could experience the Los Angeles of the future through virtual reality and replication of key sets inhabited by actors wearing actual costumes from the film.

Ready Player One

Steven Spielberg has spent more than two years adapting Ernest Cline's novel ""Ready Player One"" for the screen, and the filmmaker said he was proud to debut a new trailer inside Comic-Con's biggest exhibition hall.

Actor Tye Sheridan stars in the story about a dystopian future where humans take refuge in a virtual-reality world.

For Cline, having Spielberg make a movie based on his book is a full-circle moment. ""I learned how to be a storyteller because of this man,"" the author said.

Rep. John Lewis

Civil rights icon U.S. Rep. John Lewis led about 1,000 people on a march through the crowded San Diego Convention Center following a discussion of his trilogy of graphic novels about his participation in nonviolent protests during the civil rights movement in the 1950s and '60s.

Lewis urged the many students in attendance to recognize that they, too, can make a contribution toward a better world. He said the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., inspired him to ""get in trouble - what I call good trouble, necessary trouble.""

""Now more than ever before, we all need to get in trouble,"" he said. ""When you see something that is not right, not fair, not just, you have a moral obligation, a mission and a mandate to stand up, to speak up, to speak out and get in trouble.""

Editor's Note: An earlier version of this Associated Press report incorrectly stated the release year for ""Black Panther."" This story is now corrected to state that the movie will be released in 2018."
236,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sixth-mass-extinction-biological-annihilation/,cbsnews,"Earth faces ""biological annihilation"" in sixth mass extinction, scientists warn",['Shanika Gunaratna'],"Over the last half-billion years, scientists say there have been five mass extinction events on Earth in which a wide diversity of species on this planet suddenly died off. Now, there's growing evidence that a sixth mass extinction is unfolding, according to scientists who track species around the globe. In a new study, researchers say the current mass extinction is even ""more severe than perceived"" and amounts to ""biological annihilation"" affecting thousands of species.

In the study, published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers from Stanford University and the National Autonomous University of Mexico unveiled a granular look at population trends among 27,600 species of birds, amphibians, mammals, and reptiles — half of the world's known terrestrial vertebrates — including detailed analysis of 177 species of mammals.

The results are grim: researchers found an ""extremely high degree of population decay"" among vertebrates, even in species considered at low risk of extinction. In general, they found that the world's temperate regions are losing species at equal or even higher rates than the tropics.

""Earth is experiencing a huge episode of population declines and extirpations"" — when a species ceases to exist in a particular location — ""which will have negative cascading consequences on ecosystem functioning and services vital to sustaining civilization,"" the researchers wrote.

""We describe this as a 'biological annihilation' to highlight the current magnitude of Earth's ongoing sixth major extinction event.""

Pushed to the brink

Dividing the world's land masses into a grid of 22,000 sections measuring 10,000-square-kilometers (about 3,860 square miles) each, the researchers tracked species declines and painted a stark picture of populations being pushed to their limits.

For instance: lions have historically occupied roughly 2,000 of the 10,000-square-kilometer cells across several continents, but now occupy little more than 600 cells in sub-Saharan Africa and India. In south and southeast Asia, all the large-bodied mammals analyzed have lost more than 80 percent of their geographic ranges.

Looking through the lens of local populations extinctions (the precursor to irreversible species extinctions), the researchers conclude that ""Earth's sixth mass extinction episode has proceeded further than most assume.""

Senior conservation scientist Robin Naidoo of the World Wildlife Fund said the study ""makes a point that's sometimes missed"" by concentrating on the long, complex path that precedes species extinction, from declining populations to decreasing range. Even if it's far from extinction, a species in decline can cause ""cascading effects on vegetation and habitat"" in ecological networks that depend on balance between animals, plants and microorganisms, Naidoo told CBS News.

Conservation groups like the International Union for Conservation of Nature categorize species across the spectrum of extinction risk, from ""least concern,"" to ""near threatened,"" ""vulnerable,"" ""endangered,"" ""critically endangered,"" ""extinct in the wild,"" and eventually ""extinct.""

""This paper makes the point that it's not just about extinction — it's about declines in populations. A species doesn't have to go extinct for a variety of negative effects to be felt,"" Naidoo said.

These negative effects can directly impact humans in many ways. In fishing communities, fish so scarce they're considered ""commercially extinct"" can destroy local economies. In Africa, elephant declines due to poaching cost local economies $25 million per year in lost tourism revenue, according to a recent study from the World Wildlife Fund.

Humans are to blame

Earth's previous mass extinctions were often associated with sudden, cataclysmic natural events: abrupt changes in climate, massive volcanic eruptions, giant meteor strikes (like the one that wiped out the dinosaurs approximately 66 million years ago).

The current mass extinction stands apart because it's largely caused by humans, researchers say. From pollution to deforestation, overpopulation, poaching, warming oceans, and extreme weather events tied to global warming, human activity is the primary fuel behind this new era of irreversible species loss.

Humans are leaving the world ""a much, much poorer place,"" Elizabeth Kolbert, author of ""The Sixth Extinction"" and a staff writer for the New Yorker, told CBS News. In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book, Kolbert argues that depleting the planet's biodiversity looks likely to be humankind's most lasting legacy.

Though periodic extinctions have long played a role in life on Earth, the current scope and rate of extinctions is anything but normal. The Earth has lost 200 species of vertebrates in the past 100 years alone, the researchers behind the new study noted. If the trends of the past two million years had held up, those losses should have unfolded gradually over 10,000 years rather than a single century.

""An extinction should be something that's very unusual,"" Kolbert said. ""When you can identify lots of species that have gone extinct or are on the verge of extinction, that's actually a very unusual time in the Earth's history and a very dangerous one.""

This steady stream of species loss, about two extinctions per year, hardly makes a blip on the public's radar. In many cases, that's because the losses are obscure: recent extinctions include Mexico's Catarina pupfish or the Christmas Island pipistrelle bat, hardly household names.

Stories about these individual extinctions often fail to convey the magnitude and urgency of the larger context: that for only the sixth time in history of the planet, the Earth's biodiversity appears to be coming apart at the seams.

""I really do think — and this study underscores that — that this is the big issue of our time,"" Kolbert said. ""I mean literally right now and for the next many, many centuries, decades, perhaps millennia."""

238,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/financial-game-changers-budgeting-pregnancy-or-a-job-loss/,cbsnews,Financial game-changers: Budgeting for the unexpected,['Jillian Harding'],"Life can upend even the most carefully crafted financial plans. A surprise pregnancy or unexpected job loss, for instance, could mean putting retirement goals on hold to account for changing circumstance and priorities.

When you get thrown a curve ball, here are a few things to keep in mind to keep your retirement plan on track:

Expect the unexpected

Most financial experts recommend keeping an emergency fund that covers three to six months of expenses. Make that a full year's worth of expenses if you are self-employed or your income is prone to fluctuate.

Concerned because you don't have an emergency fund? You aren't alone: 69 percent Americans have less than $1,000 saved for a rainy day, according to a GoBankingRates survey. That's a risky place to be -- one wrong move and you could be backed into a corner with nowhere to go but a high-interest personal loan or credit card. Make a plan: There are many savings accounts with low minimum balance requirements that can help you start socking away some cash. Although the yield on many of these accounts may be low, over time that money adds up as interest is earned.

""We can all get through a major event, and we can thank the credit card industry for that,"" financial adviser Devon Klumb told CBS MoneyWatch. ""But many people do not do a good job of paying the card right away -- and if you tack 17 to 25 percent interest on a credit card [balance], people get into trouble.""

Baby on the way

Having a baby is a huge physical, emotional -- and financial -- event. The first year of a child's life, including daycare, can cost a middle-class family up to $21,000.

What can you do to minimize those costs while making the right long-term decisions for your growing family?

Do as much as you can to prepare ahead of time. Within a general timeframe of nine months, you have time to research changes to health insurance and daycare costs; also do the math on the price of daily essentials, and reach out to your support network.

There are lots of ways to cut costs. Julia Wang, digital content head at the maternity website The Bump, said people tend to overspend on items such as clothing, toys and fancy crib bedding -- much of which will be used for a very short period of time, if at all.

""Clothes have such a low return on investment -- babies grow so quickly, you'll never recoup the cost of the clothing. If you can get a hand-me-down, take advantage of it,"" she said.

Instead, purchase big-ticket items ahead of time and stock up on essentials like diapers or wipes. Start paying attention to costs of diapers and formula -- buy them now, before the baby comes, and have family and friends be on the lookout for bargains.

Another important thing to consider: maternity and paternity leave, and childcare. See if you qualify for the Family Medical Leave Act and make sure you understand your employer's maternity and paternity leave policies. Depending on your state of residence, you may have more generous leave policies, in addition to support like nursing coaches or other assistance once your child is born.

Who will care for your child on a daily basis, and what that will do to your budget? More than a third of U.S. families spend 20 percent or more of their annual income on childcare, according to a Care.com parent survey. Deciding whether outside care is right for you means carefully considering your options.

""Some people decide that mom (or dad) is done working,"" financial adviser Matthew Seppanen said. ""It's shocking how easy it is to prioritize spending when you are bringing someone into the world. Everything goes out the window.""

Especially for the first year, when a new budget is being implemented, it's okay to take a breather from retirement contributions -- as long as you factor in the changes and begin contributing again as soon as possible.

Out of a job

In the event of a sudden job loss, the most important thing to do is prioritize necessary spending. Focus on keeping the lights on, paying rent, paying your health insurance bills and getting your next job. Make sure you account for any severance your ex-employer might owe you and file for unemployment benefits if you are eligible.

It's OK if your retirement contributions are put on hold during this time period. Most experts say you should even wait to decide what to do with any existing retirement funds until you move to your next job.

""It's such a traumatic event,"" financial adviser Sanjay Jain said. ""Once you settle in your next job, then you can take care of it.""

While you may be tempted to immediately roll over any existing retirement funds into an IRA plan, many experts suggest waiting until you know where you will land. If you have a 401(k) at your former employer, your next company may use the same provider, allowing you to easily move that money over to the new plan. Immediately transferring the money to an IRA when you lose a job means you won't be able to consolidate your savings, if it's allowed at your new job.

Keeping your health insurance while unemployed is another essential. If you lose your employer-sponsored coverage, you may qualify to continue benefits with COBRA, including in cases of voluntary or involuntary job loss, a drop in work hours, and other life events. This will generally allow you to keep your current health insurance for up to a year, though you will need to pay the full premium each month. Although the monthly costs of carrying COBRA can be high, the financial risks of being uninsured are arguably higher.

""You don't want to go through a catastrophic event while you are unemployed,"" Jain said.

There is a 60-day period after you lose employer sponsored health care coverage to enroll in COBRA, which you can use to determine whether this is the best coverage option.

You could also buy an individual insurance plan under the Affordable Care Act. A job loss is a qualifying event, allowing you to purchase a policy at any time, and if your income drops you could qualify for a subsidy. (President Trump has made it his goal to repeal the law, but until then it is in effect.) If your income drops significantly, you might even be eligible for Medicaid.

Don't panic

Most important, don't panic. Examine your budget: Where can you cut back on spending? Is there a way to add income, even if it's a short-term ""side hustle""? Although your financial goals may take longer to reach, often there are ways to supplement savings and rebuild your finances.

""Overall, it is best to run several scenarios and see if it is possible to 'give a little' from several corners of your financial life – a little from the monthly budget, a slightly cheaper vacation this year, a little less in education savings, a slightly reduced contribution to retirement account, etc,"" financial adviser David Metzger told CBS MoneyWatch. ""It definitely doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing proposition. Then when the reality of the new life event has settled in, we can begin making adjustment back in the direction from which we came."""

""There is no doubt that this case is distasteful; it may be worse than that,"" wrote Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. in the majority opinion. ""But our concern is not with tawdry tales of Ferraris, Rolexes, and ball gowns. It is instead with the broader legal implications of the government's boundless interpretation of the federal bribery statute.""

CBS News

This week on 60 Minutes, correspondent Bill Whitaker reports on that ""tawdry tale,"" in which McDonnell and his wife accepted $177,000 from a local businessman in personal loans and expensive gifts. That businessman, Jonnie Williams, testified under immunity for the prosecution that he was entirely sure he and the governor had an agreement: money and gifts for political favors.

According to the 60 Minutes report, Williams wanted the governor's help getting state-sponsored studies of his tobacco-based supplement called Anatabloc, which he claimed had healing powers. To curry favor, Williams doled out cash and gifts to the Governor and his wife. There was a $6,500 Rolex watch and a $15,000 check for catering the wedding of the McDonnells' daughter. He also treated McDonnell's wife, Maureen, to a New York City shopping spree to the tune of $20,000.

Neither Jonnie Williams nor Maureen McDonnell agreed to speak with 60 Minutes. So why did Bob McDonnell?

Whitaker discusses that question in this week's 60 Minutes Overtime interview, posted in the video player above.

""I think it was because when he left the public eye, it was under a cloud of scandal,"" says Whitaker. ""And since then, his conviction was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court. I think he wants that part of the narrative to get out there.""

McDonnell's decision to talk also raises a question about his future. Was the interview part of a political comeback plan? Whitaker did ask McDonnell if he feels the pull to get back into politics, and he replied, ""I think politically probably the ship has sailed.""

Then he added: ""Never say never.""

If viewers of the 60 Minutes story wanted to hear deep remorse from McDonnell for accepting the largesse of a constituent, they came up empty. McDonnell repeatedly reminded Whitaker that he had been complying with Virginia laws -- which have since changed -- when he took the cash and gifts.

He may not have broken the law -- but did he do the right thing? ""That's the question we kept asking him,"" says Whitaker. ""It may not have been illegal, but was it right?""

""I think it's one of those things that we, the American voter, has to look at and say, are we okay with that?"" Whitaker says. ""And if we're not, what are we going to do about it?""

The chain disclosed Wednesday it received the subpoena July 19 for information tied to what health officials believe was a norovirus outbreak at its Sterling, Virginia, location.

Chipotle (CMG) noted it received a subpoena last year in connection with a criminal investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California and the Food and Drug Administration. That subpoena required documents tied to a California restaurant where a norovirus outbreak occurred in 2015. Chipotle was subpoenaed after the chain was hit with an E. coli outbreak and a separate norovirus outbreak later that year.

The company said that it doesn't know whether it would incur fines or penalties tied to the investigation.

The Loudoun County Health Department in Virginia said Monday that a second person has tested positive for norovirus, and that the strain was the same strain as in the first person who tested positive. The department says it identified more than 135 people who reported becoming ill after visiting the Chipotle in Sterling between July 13 and 16.

The health department said, however, that it has not identified the specific source of the norovirus. It says it is not aware of any customers becoming ill since the store in Sterling reopened last Wednesday, after undergoing what the restaurant chain called ""complete sanitizations.""

Denver-based Chipotle said that norovirus does not come from its food supply and that it is safe to eat at its restaurants.

Chipotle has been working to bounce back from a series of food scares that started with an E. coli outbreak in the fall of 2015 and included a norovirus case in Boston. More than 100 patrons of the restaurant, including dozens of Boston College student, fell ill with the gastrointestinal illness. The company also was forced to temporarily shut down at least 43 restaurants in Oregon and Washington because of reported E. coli cases.

Novovirus, the most common cause of foodborne illness in the U.S., causes nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, but with proper treatment most patients recover within a few days. A sick employee is believed to have been the source of the outbreak at the Boston Chipotle location.

Chipotle's financial performance was badly damaged by the food scares, as both its sales and stock price slumped."

AP

In the wake of last fall's elections, we've heard lots of talk of draining the swamp, of corruption and influence peddling, but amid all the heated discourse, you might have missed an important political story that is reverberating across the country and that we first reported in April.

""I listened to 19 guilty verdicts for my wife and me. And all I could do was sob."" Bob McDonnell

It's the case of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell, who was an up-and-coming Republican star with a squeaky clean image and a record of promoting job growth. But his political career exploded in scandal worthy of a soap opera when he was convicted of public corruption and sentenced to two years in federal prison. He fought the charges all the way to the United States Supreme Court -- wracking up a hefty legal bill of $27 million. It turned out to be worth it. The Supreme Court reversed his conviction in a controversial and far-reaching ruling – but not without a hitch. Chief Justice John Roberts described the case as ""tawdry tales.""

Tonight, looking no worse for wear, Bob McDonnell, talks about the case and the moment his world came crashing down when a Richmond jury returned a verdict against him.

Bob McDonnell: I listened to 19 guilty verdicts for my wife and me. And all I could do was sob.

Bill Whitaker: You broke down?

Bob McDonnell: Ah. That's all I could do, Bill. At that point, I was a convicted felon with a criminal record who was going to lose my law license, my right to vote, my passport, my reputation and other liberties. And my life was never going to quite be the same.

Bob McDonnell was one of the most popular Virginia governors in recent history. In 2012, he made the short list of Mitt Romney's possible running mates. But in a stunning fall from grace, in 2014, just 10 days after leaving office, McDonnell and his wife Maureen were indicted, then convicted by a jury of conspiracy and bribery. They had accepted $177,000 from a local businessman in personal loans and gifts presented as evidence in court: golf bags and clubs, luxury family vacations, the use of a Ferrari, $20,000 of designer clothes for Maureen and a Rolex watch for the governor. McDonnell appealed his guilty verdict up to the Federal Court of Appeals – and lost twice. But then his conviction was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court last fall.

Bob McDonnell: The worst at all was the-- the-- the belief that much of the public, and much of the nation looked at this, and think, ""There's another corrupt politician.""

CBS News

Bill Whitaker: And if I'm one of your citizens sitting at home in Virginia, and I see you, my governor, getting this money, these loans, these gifts, these trips, I'm-- I'm-- I'm wondering how you justify that. I mean, these things would not have come to you were you not the governor.

Bob McDonnell: That's probably right.

Bill Whitaker: How do you tell the guy, the coalminer sitting in western Virginia that that's OK?

Bob McDonnell: You know, I had to make those judgments, you know, kinda one thing at a time.

Bill Whitaker: And none of that set off alarm bells?

Bob McDonnell: It didn't, because I knew that it was -- completely legal under Virginia law.

Virginia at the time had no limits on gifts to state officials. But McDonnell's case stands out because he took so much from one person -- this man, multi-millionaire Jonnie Williams. Williams wanted the governor's help getting state-sponsored studies of his new tobacco-based supplement called Anatabloc. He claimed it had healing powers. Williams declined to talk to us, but in court he testified under immunity for the prosecution, that he was 100 percent sure he and the governor had an agreement: money and gifts for political favors.

Bob McDonnell: I considered him an entrepreneur. He had the opportunity to create jobs for Virginians.

Bill Whitaker: He plied you, and your wife, with huge sums of money, and gifts. He says that he did it, because he wanted to influence you. What did you think he wanted?

Bob McDonnell: He asked to meet with staff people. I referred him to meetings. My job was just to connect people with government and I considered it a routine part of what I did-- for job creation, and just regular constituent service.

Bill Whitaker: Is that what it takes to get the attention of you guys, somebody coughing up that kind of money?

Bob McDonnell: No.

Bob McDonnell: That is an everyday action in America and I know it to be true from years in politics.

But it wasn't politics as usual to Jim Cole. He was the deputy attorney general who oversaw the McDonnells' prosecution.

Jim Cole: He used his office for personal gain.

Bill Whitaker: The governor says all he did was make introductions.

Jim Cole: Here is somebody who took over $170,000 to do things that he could only do because he was the governor of the state.

The McDonnells actively promoted Anatabloc and invited Jonnie Williams to events at the governor's mansion with health care leaders and researchers who could help him.

Bob McDonnell: There was never a quid pro quo, or any conspiracy, or any agreement to help Mr. Williams. And ultimately the Supreme Court of the United States said that government advanced essentially a dangerous legal theory that had serious constitutional problems.

""At the end of the day, the United States Supreme Court said that this was the routine stuff that governors do."" Bob McDonnell

Bill Whitaker: What do you mean dangerous? Why dangerous?

Bob McDonnell: Because it criminalizes routine political conduct, things that happen in this country every day.

The justices did unanimously reverse his conviction – they faulted federal prosecutors for overreaching with a definition of corruption that was too broad and ruled that merely ""setting up a meeting"" or ""hosting an event"" for Jonnie Williams did not constitute a crime. But they condemned McDonnell's conduct on ethical grounds. In his opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the ""tawdry tales of Ferraris, Rolexes, and ball gowns"" did not ""typify normal political interaction…far from it."" In our interview, McDonnell chose to focus on the positive.

Bob McDonnell: At the end of the day, the United States Supreme Court said that this was the routine stuff that governors do. And we may not like the amount of gifts, but it was consistent with Virginia law and so, Bill, that's why at this point, I feel vindicated.

Bill Whitaker: Vindicated? That's not my reading of the Supreme Court decision. Chief Justice Roberts said himself, and this is a quote from his opinion, ""There is no doubt that this case is distasteful. It may be worse than that."" So this wasn't an exoneration. They looked at what you did, and called it tawdry.

Bob McDonnell: Well, I would disagree with that. You've-- you've picked two sentences out of a 28-page opinion. But the import of that opinion, Bill, is not the language that you've read. It's the other 99% of the opinion.

Bill Whitaker: But what I hear you saying is that, ""I will accept 99 percent of what the Supreme Court justices said, but that one percent that sort of slaps my wrist…

Bob McDonnell: No!

Bill Whitaker: …I'm not -- That, they got wrong.""

Bob McDonnell: No, I'm not saying that. I accept that.

Bill Whitaker: They found that your behavior was not something that they sanctioned.

Bob McDonnell: You know, the words are what the words are. I accept 100 percent of the opinion. And so, you know-- with my own conscience that's really between I guess me and God about how I did.

Bob McDonnell ran for office on a campaign of faith and family values. But when the scandal broke, apparently so did the McDonnells. The alleged husband and wife conspirators started coming to court separately. And Bob McDonnell moved here into the rectory of his church.

Bill Whitaker: You were in church yesterday. And you were telling me you were a moral man.

Bob McDonnell: I try to be, Bill.

Bill Whitaker: Did this meet your moral code?

Bob McDonnell: If I do it over again, I was governor, I wouldn't take any gifts. I didn't need 'em.

Bill Whitaker: So why'd you take 'em?

Bob McDonnell: You know, having a family vacation after working 15 hours a day at a nice lake resort with my family, you know, I appreciated that.

Bill Whitaker: But you're a public official.

Bob McDonnell: Yes.

Bill Whitaker: I think the public believes that you should reach a higher standard.

Bob McDonnell: I knew in my heart I was governing myself properly. And I knew I was making all the appropriate disclosures.

Virginia law didn't require disclosure of gifts to family members. So, he didn't report this $50,000 personal loan from Williams to a company McDonnell owned with his sister -- or most of the gifts, including the $6,500 Rolex watch Jonnie Williams gave to Maureen to give to the governor.

""I didn't know what a Rolex cost to be honest. I'm a Seiko and Timex guy, and always have been."" Bob McDonnell

Bill Whitaker: Tell me about the Rolex. I've seen the picture. You're holding the Rolex up. You're smiling.

Bob McDonnell: My wife gave it to me for Christmas in 2012. With all my heart, I believed it was from her. She told me it was from her.

Bill Whitaker: You were telling us that you needed loans, business loans. Didn't -- didn't you wonder -- ""How did my wife afford a Rolex?""

Bob McDonnell: Bill, I didn't know what a Rolex cost to be honest. I'm a Seiko and Timex guy, and always have been.

But Maureen McDonnell, a former Redskins cheerleader who brought her pom poms to her husband's inauguration, had a taste for the finer things. On a shopping spree in New York with Jonnie Williams, he bought her $20,000 worth of designer clothing and accessories. Maureen McDonnell declined to speak with us. But Bob McDonnell, who went with her to New York, told us he didn't notice what she bought and didn't ask questions.

Bill Whitaker: If my wife came in with, what was it $20,000 worth of clothing, I would notice the bags, and the boxes. I would say, honey, where'd you get all of this?

Bob McDonnell: I knew she had bags. I knew she shopped. Who paid for those was just not something that we discussed. I'm just not the kind of person that probably paid enough attention on some of those things.

His inattention to his wife became key to his defense strategy. In court, with his liberty at stake, McDonnell allowed his defense team to point the finger at his wife of more than 35 years and tell the jury she was the one taking most of the gifts and, without his knowledge, helping businessman Jonnie Williams.

CBS News

If McDonnell wasn't paying attention, the governor's chef, Todd Schneider was. He told us Jonnie Williams was a regular at the mansion.

Todd Schneider: Remember, everybody talks in the kitchen.

Bill Whitaker: And what were people saying?

Todd Schneider: What we thought of everything that they did, shady. Why is this guy trying to get in here so much the clothes and the gifts and the other things. You, kind of, knew what was going on.

Bill Whitaker: What was going on?

Todd Schneider: Jonnie Williams was trying to get his medicine approved and Bob McDonnell and Maureen McDonnell were getting their bills paid.

There is bad blood between Schneider and McDonnell. After the governor fired him in an unrelated payment dispute that ended up in court, Todd Schneider turned over key evidence to the FBI -- a $15,000 check for catering McDonnell's daughter's wedding. It came from Jonnie Williams' account, Starwood Trust. That triggered the investigation of Bob McDonnell and the federal case under former Deputy Attorney General Jim Cole.

""You wanna take the money outta politics, then take it outta politics. But this is not unique to Bob."" Hank Asbill

Jim Cole: These were not gifts. These were payoffs.

Bill Whitaker: People are giving money all the time. People make contributions.

Jim Cole: The key difference here is that the contributions didn't go to a campaign. The money that came in went into his pocket. That's not normal politics, that doesn't happen every day.

Hank Asbill: You wanna take the money outta politics, then take it outta politics. But this is not unique to Bob.

CBS News

McDonnell's attorney Hank Asbill admitted the evidence in the case looked bad, but he said, it's just the way American politics works.

Hank Asbill: You know, would anyone look at the gifts and loans in this case and say it's a good idea? No. I wasn't happy about having to defend it, but there was no crime.

Bill Whitaker: But shouldn't we expect our politicians to have a higher standard?

Hank Asbill: Maybe so. And there oughta be a better way of reforming politics in America as usual -- than going after my client and accusing him of committing a crime which he didn't commit.

Bill Whitaker: What do you think the effect of this Supreme Court decision will be on American politics?

Jim Cole: It gives much greater room for public officials to commit improper acts, to commit bribery in subtle ways, and it gives them that room to do it without worrying about getting prosecuted.

The Supreme Court ruling is shaking things up already. Politicians found guilty of bribery in New York, Pennsylvania, Utah and Louisiana are now using the McDonnell case to fight their convictions.

251,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/canadian-polygamous-leader-found-guilty-of-having-25-wives/,cbsnews,Canadian polygamous leader found guilty of having 25 wives,['Crimesider Staff'],"CRANBROOK, British Columbia — Two former leaders of an isolated polygamous community in Canada were convicted Monday of practicing polygamy after a decades-long legal fight, setting up another potential court battle over the constitutionality of Canada's polygamy laws.

Winston Blackmore, 60, and James Oler, 53, were found guilty by British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Sheri Ann Donegan, who said the evidence was clear that Blackmore was married to 25 women at the same time and that Oler was married to five women in the tiny community of Bountiful.

Blackmore, 60, never denied having the wives as part of his religious beliefs that call for ""celestial"" marriages. His lawyer Blair Suffredine has already said Blackmore would challenge the constitutionality of Canada's polygamy laws if his client was found guilty.

""I'm guilty of living my religion and that's all I'm saying today because I've never denied that,"" Blackmore told reporters after the verdict. ""Twenty-seven years and tens of millions of dollars later, all we've proved is something we've never denied. I've never denied my faith. This is what we expected.""

Blackmore and Oler were prosecuted as part of an investigation first launched in the early 1990s by the provincial government.

Under Canadian law, the maximum penalty they will each face is five year in prison. The two will be sentenced at future hearings.

Blackmore and Oler are members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, a breakaway Mormon sect that believes in plural marriage. The group's main base is in a small community on the Utah-Arizona border in the United States.

Oler was chosen to lead the Canadian community just north of the U.S. state of Idaho following Blackmore's excommunication from the sect in 2002 by Warren Jeffs, considered the prophet and leader of the group.

Authorities have said Jeffs still leads the sect from a Texas prison, where he is serving a life sentence for sexually assaulting underage girls he considered brides.

The mainstream Mormon church renounced polygamy in the late 19th century and disputes any connection to the fundamentalist group's form of Mormonism.

At the 12-day trial earlier this year, witnesses included mainstream Mormon experts, law enforcement officials who worked on the investigation and Jane Blackmore, a former wife of Winston Blackmore who left the Canadian community in 2003.

Justice Sheri Ann Donegan praised Jane Blackmore as a highly credible and reliable witness.

""She was a careful witness,"" Donegan said. ""There was nothing contrived or rehearsed in her answers. She was impartial.""

Much of the evidence in the trial came from marriage and personal records seized by law enforcement at a church compound in Texas in 2008. Donegan disagreed with assertions by Blackmore and his lawyer that the records should be given little or no weight, saying she found them reliable.

Donegan said Winston Blackmore's adherence to the practices and beliefs of the religious group were never in dispute, nothing that he did not deny his marriages to police in 2009. Blackmore even made two corrections to a detailed list of his alleged wives, she said.

""He spoke openly about his practice of polygamy,"" Donegan said. ""Mr. Blackmore confirmed that all of his marriages were celestial marriages in accordance with FLDS rules and practices.""

The investigation and attempted prosecution of Blackmore and Oler dragged on for years due to uncertainty about Canada's polygamy laws.

After a constitutional reference question was sent to the British Columbia Supreme Court, the court ruled in 2011 that laws banning polygamy were valid and did not violate religious freedoms guaranteed in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms."

John McCain is expected to return to the Senate Tuesday as lawmakers face a key vote on health care, just days after being diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer.

""Senator McCain looks forward to returning to the United States Senate tomorrow to continue working on important legislation, including health care reform, the National Defense Authorization Act, and new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea,"" his office said in a statement Monday evening.

McCain took to Twitter to also make the announcement saying he looks forward to returning to Senate:

Look forward to returning to Senate tomorrow to continue work on health care reform, defense bill & #RussiaSanctions https://t.co/VQBtovnwF1 — John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) July 25, 2017

The Arizona Republican's attendance in the upper chamber Tuesday could be key in determining whether Senate Republicans are able to open the debate and amendment process on health care reform.

Senators will first vote Tuesday to proceed to the American Health Care Act (AHCA), the health care legislation that narrowly passed the House in early May. To advance to the next step, that will require 51 votes. If that's successful, Senate Republican leaders then expect amendments to be offered to that bill, a Republican aide told CBS News. With McCain's scheduled return, Republicans can only afford two defections on some of the major proposals, assuming Democrats stick together in opposition.

McCain, for his part, has advocated going back to the committee level and negotiating health care reform on a bipartisan basis.

253,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/money-can-buy-happiness-study-says-but-theres-a-catch/,cbsnews,"Money can buy happiness, study says, but there's a catch",['Ashley Welch'],"A new study is challenging the long-held notion that money can't buy happiness.

It turns out, it can — if you use that spare cash to buy yourself some free time, such as hiring someone do common household chores like cooking or cleaning or paying your neighbor's kid to mow the lawn, researchers found.

The study, led by researchers at the University of British Columbia (UBC) and Harvard Business School, is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The researchers surveyed more than 6,000 adults in the U.S., Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands about how much they spent each month to buy themselves free time. The participants also rated their life satisfaction and reported their feelings of stress related to the amount of time they have.

An analysis of the data showed that people who spent money in ways that gave them more free time reported greater life satisfaction.

Importantly, the effect was seen in people across a range of different income levels.

""That was surprising to us,"" UBC psychology professor and the study's senior author Elizabeth Dunn told CBS News. ""It would make sense if this strategy was only something effective once you had a high level of disposable income. But our research shows that that's actually not the case. The strategy is effective for people even at lower ends of the income spectrum.""

That being said, she acknowledges that the study only looked at working adults and wouldn't necessarily apply to those in poorer circumstances.

Dunn first gained interest in this field of study based on her personal experience.

""I originally started studying this topic of whether money could be happiness when I started making money and was puzzled by what to do with it,"" she said. ""I went from being a graduate student living near the poverty line to getting my first faculty job. I had disposable income all of a sudden and wondered what to do with it.""

She became curious if there were anything in scientific literature looking at the optimal way to use money to increase happiness, but she found little in the existing body of research.

Dunn and her team also conducted a field experiment to test whether buying time actually leads to greater happiness. The researchers randomly assigned 60 adults to spend $40 on a time-saving purchase one weekend and $40 on a material purchase another weekend.

The results showed that participants reported greater satisfaction when they spent the money buying time rather than material goods.

""They were less likely to feel time stress and say things like 'there's not enough time in the day.' This is important because we often hear about the role of financial affluence in well-being, but it turns out that time affluence is also pretty important in understanding well-being,"" Dunn said. ""The idea is that if we can promote time affluence by buying time then that should increase happiness.""

Interestingly, despite the benefits of buying time, the researchers found it's not as common a practice as they'd expect.

In a survey of 850 millionaires, nearly half reported not spending any money on outsourcing chores they dislike.

A similar survey of 98 working adults found only 2 percent said they would use an extra $40 on something that would save them time.

Dunn said the research should help people feel less guilty when it comes to spending money to save time.

""If there's a task that you dread doing that is one of the most miserable parts of your week, ask yourself if paying somebody else to do it is something you can afford,"" she said. ""If the answer is yes, even if it seems a bit indulgent, it's probably a good use of money."""

Health care is one of the issues CBS News contributor Frank Luntz discussed with a bipartisan group of Congress members that included three senators and nine representatives. Six were Democrats and six were Republicans.

""The Republicans demonized Obamacare. And the Democrats are demonizing the Republican legislation. Is that the way we should be discussing what may be the most important issue you will deal with this year?"" Luntz asked.

""Some of us probably have philosophical differences. I believe that if you live in America, you've got a right to affordable quality health care. And I think probably everybody agrees on that value. And the difference is how do you get us there,"" Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., said.

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, said Republicans haven't made an effort to work with Democrats on the bill.

""I can speak recently there was no outreach to Democrats in the House to work together. So it wasn't a matter of saying, 'Here is what we're doing. And you're either on you're on board or not.' … There was not a significant, meaningful effort made from the beginning, saying, 'Hey, let's put our heads together and try to work this out,'"" Gabbard said.

""The challenge that we hear on these issues, these jugular issues, is a Republican alternative or a Democrat solution. The American people aren't concerned about labels. They want to know about their health care,"" Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., said. ""People want to know, 'What are my copays? How will I take my child to the doctor? What does it look like if I can't afford it?' If we're not answering those basic questions and if we cannot find a point to rally around, it's our fault.""

Luntz also brought up the multiple investigations into Russia meddling in the U.S. election.

""I think we all have bipartisan support and respect for Bob Mueller,"" Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said of the former FBI director and special counsel leading the FBI investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia.

Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, agreed.

""I worked for Mueller and the Justice Department. He has the utmost integrity. It's in his hands. He will do a thorough investigation. I have every confidence in that investigation,"" McCaul said, adding, ""But I will tell you that I think most of us in this room agree that there should be a consequence to Crimea being annexed, Ukraine being invaded, the Russians interfering in our democracy… And we will have, Frank, a Russian sanctions bill, a sanctions bill against Russia on the floor of the House, I hope, in the very, very near future.""

There was bipartisan agreement with what McCaul said.

""The only person who disagrees with the chairman is the president. … And while he disagrees with it, he's running down NATO, he's running down the European Union and Putin couldn't ask for a better friend than that,"" Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., said.

According to Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., the Russia probe has ""become too much of an issue as to what our real job is.""

""If we're not looking at some level to make this economy dynamic and robust again and getting people back to work, if we're more concentrating on the Russians interfering with our elections as opposed to Russians interfering with our economy right now, and thus turning away from our real job of getting people back to work, seeing wages rise again, seeing families be able to be together,"" Kelly said.

Kelly disagreed, pointing to the need to multitask.

""But congressman, but look, we come here week after week after week, with respect, week after week after week, and do nothing. We don't pass any legislation,"" Bennet said. ""We don't walk and chew gum at the same time. The American people expect us to do that. The Russians attacked our elections. We need to respond to the Russians. And we need to do the work you're talking about on the economy. We need to do both.""

Lastly, Luntz asked the group whether there will be tax reform, and whether it will be bipartisan.

""Right now, I don't see it happening,"" Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., said. ""A lot of big issues out there we need to address. We need to respond to business – to some of the business taxes, corporate taxes.""

""You've set a litmus test already. And it hasn't even begun to be. But isn't that the problem?"" Luntz asked.

""Well, you're talking about values, okay? So in principles – philosophical principles that we have. So I think a lot of us would agree tax code needs to be simplified,"" Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, said. There was bipartisan agreement on simplifying the tax code.

Asked whether Congress can function, Gabbard said ""absolutely.""

""I think the point is about having respect. And here, in this body in Congress, yes, it stems from having relationships. It stems from having an authentic respect for our colleagues, whether we agree on disagree on one issue or almost all issues,"" Gabbard said, adding, ""Because that's what people want from Washington."""

259,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/raw-chicken-should-you-wash-it/,cbsnews,Does washing raw chicken make it safer to eat?,['Bianca Seidman'],"Though it may seem like good hygiene to wash chicken before cooking it, researchers at Drexel University say people have that all wrong. They've developed a campaign to try to change the misperception, called ""Don't Wash Your Chicken.""

""People are attached to the idea of washing raw poultry,"" Jennifer Quinlan, Associate Professor in the Nutrition Science Department at Drexel University, said in program materials. ""Some think they're cleaning off germs. Some just want to get slime off, or feel like it's dirty.""

Much of the chicken purchased at the supermarket, regardless of which parts or whether or not it has skin, comes with campylobacter or salmonella bacteria. Neither cold or warm water, nor fruit acids will kill those bacteria, which can sometimes cause severe cases of food-borne illness.

The way to make chicken safe to eat is to cook it thoroughly. The internal temperature of the chicken should reach 165 °F as measured with a food thermometer, according to FDA guidelines. Whether it's grilled, baked, fried or slow-cooked, it's the exposure to high heat that kills all the bacteria.

The ""Don't Wash Your Chicken"" program website says: ""If germs were visible to the naked eye, you would see that washing poultry just splashes bacteria all over you, your kitchen towels, your countertops, and any other food you have nearby, such as raw foods or salads. This can make people sick, especially young children, pregnant women, older adults and the immunocompromised.""

To illustrate the risk, a mock infrared animation of ""Germ-vision"" shows how these tiny particles of bacteria can spray far and wide when chicken is washed -- a process called aerosolization.

Quinlan said she discovered how prevalent chicken washing is through the course of her research on the quality and safety of food in minority populations, as part of a USDA-funded program. Through surveys and focus groups in the Philadelphia area, the research team found that washing chicken before cooking was common to several groups. Expanded research showed that the practice is almost universal.

The goal of the campaign is to educate people about the dangers of spreading bacteria and cross-contaminating other foods by washing chicken.

For those who want to take an extra cleaning step to remove sliminess before cooking, the FDA recommends wiping chicken with a disposable paper towel. Then be careful to wash any utensils, plates, cutting boards or kitchen counters that came in contact with raw chicken to avoid spreading the bacteria while you finish cooking."

For seven years, repealing the health care law has been one of the central organizing principles of the GOP -- but they've found it difficult to deliver on it now that they're actually in power. With the vote on Tuesday narrowly passing, the Senate will begin debate on a bill to replace the ACA that passed the House in March, amending and tweaking it as the process goes on.

How did we get to this moment?

Here's a timeline of health care reform efforts during the President Trump's time in office and during the 115th Congress:

January 20

Mr. Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office aimed at tackling Obamacare's individual mandate. The individual mandate requires Americans to buy health insurance or pay a penalty.

February 5

Mr. Trump gave his administration an extended timeline to repeal and replace Obamacare. When asked if repeal legislation would pass in 2017, Mr. Trump said in an interview with Fox News, ""Yes, in the process and maybe it'll take till sometime into next year but we're certainly going to be in the process.""

February 20

House Republicans praised their outline to repeal and replace Obamacare, as GOP leaders distributed talking points to their colleagues which said their plan ""ensures more choices, lower costs and greater control over your health care.""

February 26

House Republicans circulated a draft of their health care bill, which Democratic lawmakers were quick to criticize.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said the plan was ""a recipe for disaster,"" while House Minority Nancy Pelosi, D-California, noted that the Republican draft would result in millions of Americans losing coverage.

Some of the key provisions in the House Republican bill included the end of Medicaid's expansion, the elimination of taxes on the wealthy and the creation of tax credits up to $4,000.

March 17

House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California, announced a vote on a Republican sponsored bill to repeal and replace Obamacare will be held the following week.

March 23

House Republicans postponed a vote on the American Health Care Act as they didn't have enough support for the bill to pass.

The postponed vote also came in the wake of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) releasing a score on the bill. Their findings estimated that 14 more people would be uninsured by 2018 and 24 more million people uninsured by 2026 under the new plan compared to the current law.

Coupled with the CBO score was the release of a Quinnipiac University poll that highlighted the unfavorable ratings of the House Republican bill. The poll showed that only 17 percent of American voters approve of the AHCA.

During the evening, White House OMB Director Mick Mulvaney indicated to House GOP members that Mr. Trump was finished negotiating on the bill. The President requested a vote on May 24th so that the administration could move onto other items on Mr. Trump's agenda.

March 24

House Speaker Paul Ryan officially cancelled the vote on the ACHA as it didn't have enough support from House GOP members. During his press conference, Ryan said House Republicans ""came up short"" and noted that Obamacare will remain in the ""foreseeable future.""

After Speaker Ryan pulled the bill from the floor, Mr. Trump said Republicans came ""very, very close"" to passing the bill. He added that it is time to ""let Obamacare explode.""

Mr. Trump also pressured the House Freedom Caucus to vote for the legislation. ""The irony is that the Freedom Caucus, which is very pro-life and against Planned Parenthood, allows P.P. to continue if they stop this plan!""

April 4

The White House proposed a new health care plan to repeal and replace Obamacare as Vice President Pence, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney met with House GOP members.

After meeting with the House Republican conference, Speaker Ryan told reporters there is no legislative text yet and they are in the ""concept stages"" of the bill.

April 26

After not supporting the first version of the American Health Care Act in March, the House Freedom Caucus supported a new version of the bill that included an amendment from Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-New Jersey, that would allow states to apply for waivers from some parts of Obamacare, including the law's definition of essential health benefits and its rules regarding pre-existing conditions. States who wish to obtain a waiver under the proposal would be required to set up a high-risk pool to cover sicker people who might otherwise be unable to purchase insurance, but there were questions about whether the high-risk pools would provide sufficient coverage.

The House Freedom Caucus had been criticized by President Trump for not supporting the original version of the bill. The caucus, a group of roughly three dozen House conservatives, argued that the AHCA wasn't a full repeal of Obamacare. Mr. Trump expressed his frustration with the caucus when he tweeted, ""The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don't get on the team, & fast. We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018!""

The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don't get on the team, & fast. We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 30, 2017

April 30

In an interview with CBS News ""Face the Nation,"" Mr. Trump insisted that pre-existing conditions were covered in the new version of the AHCA. He added that the bill evolved from the original version that failed a month earlier.

""This bill is much different than it was a little while ago, okay?"" he said in the ""Face the Nation"" interview.

May 4

The House passed the updated version of the AHCA with a final vote count of 217-213. The bill passed with 20 Republicans voting against the bill and without any support from Democrats.

The bill includes revamped tax credits, while eliminating Obamacare's individual mandate that requires people to purchase health insurance. The bill would also freeze Medicaid expansion under Obamacare and allow states to receive Medicaid funding as a block grant.

The challenge then moved to the Senate and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham tweeted that Senators should proceed with caution.

May 31

The Kaiser Family Foundation released a poll on the favorability ratings of the ACHA. According to the poll, 55 percent Americans viewed the AHCA as ""unfavorable,"" while 31 percent of Americans favored the bill.

June 22

Senate Republicans released their ""discussion draft"" of their health care bill, which would repeal and replace Obamacare, after weeks of secrecy. The 142 page bill, known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), was supposedly crafted by 13 Senate Republican men in a closed door process. But even some members of that group complained they had no idea what was in the bill, and that it was being written by Majority Leader McConnell's staff.

The Senate is using the budget reconciliation process to get the bill through, which means that Republicans need a simple majority--50 votes plus a tie breaking vote from the Vice President, instead of 60 votes to get the bill through the legislative process. The Senate currently has 52 Republicans and 48 Democrats.

The bill would cut Medicaid expansions under Obamacare and eliminate the Obamacare individual mandate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced the Senate would vote on the measure before the July 4 recess.

June 26

The CBO released their score on the Senate health care bill, which indicated that 22 million more Americans would be uninsured over ten years under the new plan.

This score was similar to the CBO's score of the AHCA, which estimated that 23 more million Americans would be uninsured under that plan.

The dismal forecast was enough for Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah to announce their opposition. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas had already voiced their opposition.

June 27

A day after the CBO score was released on their health care bill, McConnell informed Senate Republicans that a vote on their bill would be postponed until after July 4 recess. McConnell said Republicans lack the votes to pass the legislation as it currently stood.

""We're still working toward getting at least 50 people in a comfortable place,"" McConnell said.

June 30

As Senate Republicans were scrambling to garner votes to pass their bill, Mr. Trump added to the health care debate by tweeting, ""If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date!""

If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 30, 2017

July 4

Some Republican senators who headed home for the July 4 recess were confronted by constituents opposed to the repeal effort. After on event in Kansas, conservative Sen. Jerry Moran said, ""I think at this point, it's time to figure out how … to get rid of the bad things and improve on the things that need to be improved,"" according to Politico.

In Iowa, GOP Sen. Joni Ernst declined to take a stand in support of the Republican bill during her own town hall meeting. ""I am not going to say whether I would or would not support that bill, because I am offering up my own ideas, my own suggestions, and I'd like to see them included in the bill,"" the Iowa senator said, according to the Des Moines Register. ""We'll continue with those discussions.""

July 13

The Senate released a new draft of the BCRA, which included an amendment proposed by Republican Senator Ted Cruz, in their latest effort to repeal and replace Obamacare.

Sen. Cruz's amendment would allow insurers to sell cheaper bare-bones plans if they offer a plan that complies with Obamacare standards. The modified version also would keep three Obamacare taxes on the wealthy and have an increase of $45 billion dollars to combat the opioid crisis.

The bill needed 51 votes, including a tie breaking vote from Vice President Pence, on a motion to proceed, which would bring the bill to floor.

Sen. Collins and Sen. Paul announced they would vote against the motion to proceed on this version of the bill, which meant that Senate Republicans could not afford to lose another vote, assuming that no Democrats would vote for the bill to advance.

July 17

Republican Senators Mike Lee and Jerry Moran announced their opposition to the BCRA, joining Sen. Collins and Sen. Paul.

The four senators expressed they were a 'no' vote on the motion to proceed, which meant McConnell would be unable to even begin work on the amendment process.

McConnell released a statement expressing his disappointment with the Senate being unable to pass a repeal and replace bill. McConnell's statement also indicated that the Senate will vote on the House bill passed in May. The first amendment on the House bill would be to replace the House bill with a bill from 2015, which would repeal Obamacare and give lawmakers two years to devise a replacement. The 2015 bill passed the Senate two years ago.

July 18

Sen. Collins, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia announced their opposition to repealing Obamacare without a replacement. Their announcement to vote 'no' on the motion to proceed complicates McConnell's proposal to hold a vote on repeal only legislation.

At a White House event with military officers, Mr. Trump said to ""let Obamacare fail.""

When discussing the collapse of Obamacare, Mr. Trump added, ""I can tell you that the Republicans are not going to own it. We'll let Obamacare fail and then the Democrats are going to come to us and they're going to say how do we fix it?""

July 19

Mr. Trump hosted a White House lunch with Senate GOP members to make another pitch to repeal and replace Obamacare.

""For seven years, you had an easy route,"" Mr. Trump said to Senate GOP members. ""I don't think we should leave town unless we have a plan.""

Mr. Trump's push for a repeal and replacement plan during the lunch comes a day after he said to ""let Obamacare fail.""

Later in the day, the CBO released its score on the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act of 2017, which is the repeal only bill McConnell said the Senate will vote on after the second version of the BCRA failed to gain enough support. The score displayed that 32 million more people would be uninsured under this plan by 2026 compared to current law.

July 20

The CBO released its score of the second version of the BCRA that included the amendment proposed by Sen. Cruz. The score forecasted that 22 million more Americans would be uninsured by 2026 under the new plan compared to Obamacare.

July 21

The Senate parliamentarian determined that certain provisions in the BCRA violate the ""Byrd Rule,"" which means that these provisions would require a 60-vote point of order, rather than the simple majority granted through the budget reconciliation process.

The Senate Budget Committee released the provisions that violate the ""Byrd Rule"" that would need a 60-vote point of order. Some of the provisions include defunding Planned Parenthood and funding for cost-sharing subsidies.

July 24

Mr. Trump delivered remarks a day before a vote is expected on the motion to proceed to a Senate health care bill.

He urged Senate Republicans to ""keep their promise"" to repeal and replace Obamacare after seven years of campaigning on this issue and unifying behind this promise.

""We, as a party, must fulfill that promise to repeal and replace, what they've been saying for the past 7 years,"" Mr. Trump said.

In the morning, Mr. Trump said Senate Republicans have another opportunity to repeal and replace Obamacare when he tweeted, ""Republicans have a last chance to do the right thing on Repeal & Replace after years of talking & campaigning on it.""

Republicans have a last chance to do the right thing on Repeal & Replace after years of talking & campaigning on it. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2017

July 25

The Senate voted 51-50 with Vice President casting the tie-breaking vote on the motion to proceed to the AHCA, which is the bill the House passed in May.

Sen. Collins and Sen. Murkowski were the only Senate Republicans who voted 'no' on the motion to proceed. All Senate Democrats opposed the procedural vote. Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada, Sen. Capito and Sen. Paul voted 'yes' on the motion to proceed.

After being diagnosed with glioblastoma, a form of brain cancer, last week, Sen. John McCain of Arizona returned to the Senate to vote 'yes' on the motion to proceed. He was welcomed by applause and a standing ovation from Senate members from both parties."

But it’s his fashions for women of all shapes, shades and sizes that give him a unique style. Serena Altschul has more:

When it comes to fashion, one name that’s trending is Christian Siriano. And with awards season in full swing, the 31-year-old is starting to feel the pressure.

“It is a big moment,” he said of the Oscars red carpet. “Because so many people watch and so many people judge. There’s a lot of red carpet commentary, some unwanted!”

Judging from this year’s Golden Globe Awards, where three stars (Angela Bassett, Rachel Bloom and Issa Rae) wore his designs, and the Emmys, where he dressed nine, his clothes are wearing well.

“So that’s a record then?” Altschul asked.

“I don’t even know if it was a record, but it was quite a lot!” he laughed.

CBS News

Siriano’s client list is impressive. It includes a galaxy of stars, some of whom may shine at tonight’s Academy Awards. But when asked to share who might be wearing Siriano tonight, he demurred. “I can’t, because I don’t know!”

But he does know fashion. Siriano recently revealed his fall line during New York Fashion Week. The theme was “The Desert,” and backstage he was surprisingly cool.

“I try to be a little Zen. I really can’t stress myself out so much. But that five minutes before, when we’re really, like, getting dressed and ready, that’s when it’s scary.”

Fashion is a high-stakes business, but Siriano is willing to take risks. Take a close look at the runway models: they are all shapes, shades and sizes, and it’s all by design.

Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images

“I don’t care what size they are, I don’t care where they’re from. I just want them to feel good in what we’re creating for them,” he said.

That attitude is what brought Siriano to fashion in the first place. Born in Annapolis, Md., he was 13 when he started designing clothes, inspired by his size 16 mother and size 2 sister.

“I had every color, ethnicity, every size, every person around me. So it just wasn’t different. I think that that’s what I’m trying to get people used to, that it should just be the norm. It doesn’t have to be, like, a topic.”

Siriano’s creativity was encouraged by his parents, and in 2004 he moved to London where he interned with celebrated designers Vivienne Westwood and Alexander McQueen.

But when Siriano returned home, he struggled to find work, until he auditioned for the fashion competition show, “Project Runway.”

His highly-theatrical approach to clothing earned him a lot of attention. He became the show’s youngest winner, an experience he looks back on with mixed emotions. “That’s like an actress who can’t stand to be known for a film that she did her whole career, you know? That can be frustrating. But I definitely think now I probably wouldn’t do it.”

“But you wouldn’t be where you are,” Altschul said.

“I definitely would be in a different place than I am now.”

Kevin Winter/Getty Images

Siriano has had his hits and (some think) misses, like this dress worn by actress Christina Hendricks at the 2010 Golden Globes (left).

“We got a lot of hate on that dress. Tons of hate. People hated it! [Someone] said, ‘Don’t put a big girl in a big dress.’”

But it meant the world to him last summer when Michelle Obama appeared at the Democratic National Convention clad in a classic blue dress he designed. “I’m okay with saying that that definitely changed my career.”

Emboldened by success, Siriano willingly broke the high-fashion mold by dressing “Saturday Night Live” actress Leslie Jones, for her 2016 “Ghostbusters” premiere, after her tweet revealed that other designers declined.

And he capped the year off with his marriage to singer-songwriter Brad Walsh.

On the red carpet, the runway, or anywhere, Christian Siriano has made his mark as a designer for every body, like it or not.

Altschul asked, “So when people say, ‘Oh, how could you do that?,’ of course you’re going to take it personally?”

“Yeah. You take it really personally. But then you do it again!” he laughed. “My always thing is, if I waited around for certain people to come around and support [me], I’d still be waiting.”

268,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-transgender-ban-service-members-costs/,cbsnews,Trump says transgender soldiers cost too much -- is that true?,['Aimee Picchi'],"In laying out his reasons for moving on Wednesday to ban transgender people from serving in the U.S. military, President Donald Trump cited the ""tremendous medical costs"" associated with the policy.

His claim raises several immediate questions, such as exactly how much the Department of Defense spends on providing health care for transgender service members, as well as whether there are enough transgender people in the armed forces to move the needle on the department's annual $6 billion in health care spending on active-duty forces.

....victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017

The answer? President Trump's assertion that permitting transgender people in the armed services entails major health care costs appears to be overblown, based on estimates from the think tank RAND, which was asked by the Department of Defense to study the issue last year. Health care costs for treating active members who want to transition to another gender would increase by between $2.4 million to $8.4 million annually, RAND found. That translates to 0.04 percent to 0.13 percent of the agency's annual spending on health care.

""Our study found that the number of U.S. transgender service members who are likely to seek transition-related care is so small that a change in policy will likely have a marginal impact on health care costs and the readiness of the force,"" the Rand researchers wrote.

Likewise, a 2015 study in the New England Journal of Medicine concluded that the health care costs related to transition for transgender service members ""is too low to warrant consideration in the current policy debate."" Its author estimated the costs at $5.6 million annually, or ""little more than a rounding error.""

Mr. Trump's announcement reverses an Obama-era military policy that began last year under which transgender service members may openly serve in the military. Since that policy was implemented, transgender troops have been able to receive medical care and start changing their gender identification in the Pentagon's personnel system.

When former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced the transgender service policies in 2016, he cited RAND's estimate that about 2,500 people, out of 1.3 million active-duty service members, are transgender.

""The medical treatment that service members who are currently transgender requires fairly straightforward, well-understood,"" Carter said at the time in a press briefing to discuss the policy. RAND was ""able to make those estimates. And that was, as they said, minimal.""

Some military personnel are already in the process of changing gender, or have been formally approved to change gender. The numbers are small, however, with the Associated Press noting it currently stands at about 250 service members.

NEW: Former Defense Secretary Ash Carter responds to President Trump's Transgender Ban pic.twitter.com/p8jY1FfXDZ — CBS Evening News (@CBSEveningNews) July 26, 2017

Carter spoke out on Wednesday against President Trump's transgender ban in a statement to CBS Evening News. "" To choose service members on other grounds than military qualifications is social policy and has no place in the military,"" he said. ""There are already transgender individuals who are serving capably and honorably.""

Some conservatives said they supported President Trump's ban. Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Missouri said Wednesday in a statement that ""sex-change surgeries"" would ""cost more than a billion dollars over the next ten years."" She didn't cite a source for her estimate.

Even if the military spent at the top end of the estimated range for health care on transgender service members -- $8.4 million per year -- it would reportedly represent a fraction of what it spends on Viagra. The Department of Defense spent $41.6 million in 2014 on the erectile-dysfunction drug, or about five times what transgender service members would cost, according to an estimate from the Military Times."

Officials with the Chicago Police Department said the city's investment in crime-fighting technology is helping officers.

Tevion Walker is one of the repeat gun offenders driving violence in Chicago, police said. The 21-year-old was arrested Friday and charged with possession of an illegal handgun.

It's Walker's third weapons offense while on parole for another weapons offense from 2015, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said.

Johnson said that Walker and other repeat gun offenders are emboldened by the lack of accountability in Illinois, and he hopes tougher gun laws will change that.

""My goal isn't to incarcerate more people. My goal is to send that message that if you pick up a gun, you'll pay the price for it,"" Johnson said.

Technology like ShotSpotter -- a series of microphones set up designed to detect the sound of gunshots and pinpoint their location -- is helping in some of Chicago's most violent neighborhoods, Johnson said.

""It gives us a head start into, perhaps, capturing those offenders, or at least for recovering the ballistics evidence,"" he said.

The department said shootings are down from 1,868 last year to 1,624 this year. Meanwhile, gun arrests are up, with 2,401 this year compared to 1,820 in 2016.

Murder arrests are also up, with 152 this year compared to 138 in 2016.

Johnson said the real key to solving many of these crimes is help from the community.

""The people in the neighborhoods hear and know who these individuals are, so when the neighborhoods get sick and tired of it, get fed up, and start giving us the information that we need, then we'll start seeing a reduction in gun violence,"" he said.

Johnson said he would also like to see tougher laws that hold people who buy guns accountable when the gun is not reported lost or stolen. He said it would cut down on people buying guns out of state and giving them to criminals in Chicago.

On Tuesday, the department posted an image of 11 weapons on its Facebook page. It said the weapons were recovered after information came in about stolen weapons being transported from Knoxville to Chicago.

Police said they arrested one suspect who now faces felony gun charges."
271,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sunscreen-study-shows-people-apply-it-wrong/,cbsnews,What sunscreen users are doing wrong,['Mary Brophy Marcus'],"Most people don't use sunscreen correctly, a new study shows.

Experts know using sunscreen properly can reduce the risk for skin cancer. And millions of us know we're supposed to do it. But to find out what happens when people actually apply sunscreen in real life, researchers from the University of Minnesota Medical School in Minneapolis set up free sunscreen dispensers at the Minnesota State Fair in 2016. Then they watched as 2,187 people used the dispensers over the next 93 hours.

They discovered that only one-third of people applied the sunscreen to every part of their exposed skin as recommended — and less than half (42 percent) spread sunscreen on their faces.

""Thirty-three percent is actually higher than I thought it would have been, but it was sunny and the free dispenser probably motivated people to do a little better,"" Dr. Darrell Rigel, clinical professor of dermatology at NYU and past president of the American Academy of Dermatology, told CBS News.

When it came to body parts, 51 percent applied sunscreen to their arms, but only 6 percent rubbed it on exposed areas of their chests. The lower extremities were practically ignored with only 3.6 percent of users spreading sunscreen on their legs.

On cloudy days, fewer people used sunscreen at all — even though the researchers note that ""up to 80 percent of the sun's harmful UV rays"" can still reach your skin in cloudy weather.

Their study is published in Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.

To fight skin cancer, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) recommends using one ounce of sunscreen – about the amount that can fit in a shot glass.

""It takes one ounce, theoretically, to cover your whole body,"" said Rigel, who was not involved in the study.

People tend to skimp on sunscreen, applying only 25 to 50 percent of what's really needed, said Rigel. He recommends using a higher SPF product to help compensate for that.

Look for a sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of 30 or higher that says ""broad spectrum"" on the label — meaning that it protects against both UVA and UVB rays.

Wearing sun protective clothing with long sleeves and a hat can also reduce the risk of developing skin cancer.

""With a hat, for every one inch of brim you wear on a regular basis, you lower your skin cancer risk by about 10 percent. A 4-inch brim will lower your skin cancer risk by 40 percent,"" Rigel said.

Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States, according to the AAD. One in five Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime.

Rigel wasn't surprised that women used the sunscreen dispensers more than men in the study, even though the researchers noted that more men attended the fair than women. Women made up 51 percent of fairgoers but 57 percent of sunscreen users.

""Women are better about every health behavior,"" he said, adding that dermatologists know that men delay seeking care when it comes to a spot on the skin that's growing.

Dermatologists say everyone should be using sunscreen, even on overcast days, except for babies under six months of age, whose skin is more porous and sensitive to the chemicals in sunscreens. Rigel recommends parents keep infants out of the sun or well protected in the shade and sun-protective clothing.

Suncreen lasts about two hours then starts to degrade, so you have to keep reapplying for full protection.

""Put it on before you go to work and then when you go out for lunch, reapply it. Most importantly, make sure it's at least SPF 30,"" said Rigel.

All in all, he added, ""I was encouraged that many people used sunscreen, but the study also showed two-thirds of people wouldn't put on free sunscreen, so we have a way to go with public education."""

Zukunft says that now, the drugs keep coming, and last year, the Coast Guard couldn't even chase hundreds of shipments it knew about.

""There were over 500 events that literally eluded us,"" Zukunft said. ""We knew they were out there. This really came down to we didn't have enough planes, we didn't have enough ships.""

He says much of his fleet is decades past retirement age. And the Coast Guard needs $1.5 billion just to catch up on maintenance.

Chief Warrant Officer Bill Hantzmon is captain of the 55-year-old Sledge.

""This ship is 11 years older than you!"" Evans said.

""It is,"" Hantzmon replied.

CBS News

He and his crew spend their days maintaining buoys and navigational aids, but sometimes, they're forced to jury-rig parts for their own ship because they aren't made anymore.

""They can put you out of commission?"" Evans asked.

""Absolutely. It can keep us from where we are about to do our mission and we have to stay at the pier,"" Hantzmon said.

CBS News

When the Sledge was in port for repair this winter, its age really showed. Repairs were only supposed to take about six weeks, but the ship ended up being dry-docked for six months. Parts of the hull were rusted and had to be cut away and replaced.

Fifty-five is old for a ship, but the Sludge is not the oldest.

""Our oldest is 72 years old,"" Zukunft said.

He says the last thing he'll cut back on are rescues and security patrols. So for now, old ships are being rebuilt as the political fight over dollars and cents plays out."
274,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-kors-still-on-the-cutting-edge/,cbsnews,Michael Kors: Still on the cutting edge,[],"Michael Kors made a name for himself designing clothes for celebrities. But he’s made his fortune with clothes that are “ready to wear” by anyone. He shares his secrets with Rita Braver:

Backstage, the models are frantically prepping to walk the runway. But out in the house where the show will start in just minutes, one man is surprisingly serene:

“Over 35 years of putting on fashion shows, and I don’t get nervous,” said Michael Kors. “But I guess I’m kind of like the expectant dad, you know? This thing has been a long time coming and you want to see that gorgeous baby.”

And indeed, even hardened fashion critics agreed, it was gorgeous! Rufus Wainright sang his heart out, A-Listers like Emily Blunt and Sienna Miller studded the first row, and models of the moment (like Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid) strutted their stuff.

Fifty-seven-year-old Michael Kors took a victory lap, and why not? It’s been quite a journey.

He showed his first season when he was 21 years old, “and by the time the clothes arrived in the stores, I was 22,” he told Braver. “I knew nothing, I have to tell you. I don’t know what UPS was. I mean, I didn’t know how you actually delivered the clothes to the stores!”

Born on suburban Long Island, he started out as Karl Anderson. But his Mom let him change both his first and last names when she remarried.

And that wasn’t all: at age 5, she brought him to a fitting for her wedding gown.

“And I just sat in the corner making a face,” he recalled. “And my mom said, ‘What’s wrong?’ And I said, ‘I don’t know, it’s just way too busy -- it had a lot of bows.’ And I said, ‘You know what? I think it would look better without the bows.’”

Within a few years of graduating high school, he was working at a Manhattan shop where the owners gave him a chance to design his own creations.

CBS News

The response to the pieces the boutique started having made based on his designs was “Amazing,” he said. “I mean, it was crazy. We’d put it in the window and you know (snaps his fingers) you immediately knew a woman would come in and say, ‘Oh, can I try it on?’ And you’d say, ‘Wait, I’m on to something here; let’s do more of that.’”

His fledgling line caught the eye of one of fashion’s most powerful prognosticators: Anna Wintour, then at New York Magazine:

“I took the collection and I kind of packed it into these big, messy garment bags, and I jumped on the subway, and I went off to see Anna. And I remember it was her fall issue of New York Magazine, and I was her fashion thing to look forward to.”

Today, as Editor-in-chief of Vogue, Wintour still cares enough for Kors to step out on the red carpet with him at a fundraiser he’s hosting for his favorite charity, God’s Love We Deliver, which provides meals to the sick. And yes, she’s wearing Michael Kors.

Braver asked, “What is about his work that you like? What gets you into a Michael Kors?”

“I think Michael has always understood the modern American woman, that he is trying to make her look the best that she can,” Wintour replied. “He’s less concerned about clothes wearing a woman. He wants the woman to wear the clothes.”

And it doesn’t hurt that some of those women are celebrities: Michelle Obama (in her first official portrait), Viola Davis (at this year’s Golden Globes), and Kate Hudson (on many occasions).

“When a woman puts something on, and her whole body changes and her energy changes and her confidence changes, he feels like he’s succeeded,” Hudson said. “And he really, really lives and breathes it.”

There are a lot of boldface names in the world of Michael Kors, such as the outfit Blake Lively wore while pregnant: “She wore it during the day and threw, like, a grey hoodie over it.”

At his flagship store on Madison Avenue, Kors proudly shows off his couture line: sumptuous fabrics, with prices to match.

“The handwork, all of this, is all done by hand,” Kors said.

“This dress must cost thousands of dollars,” said Braver.

“It does. It does. But you’ll have it forever.” And the stretchy fabric will keep fitting.

But the bulk of his sales -- and most of the almost 800 other Michael Kors stores -- are devoted to his lower-priced lines. He also designs clothes for men. But, Kors says, his clients all have similar aspirations: “They want to look fashionable and current. They want to feel powerful but sexy. They want to feel youthful but not ridiculous.”

CBS News

It seems hard to imagine, but at one time, Kors almost lost it all. In the early 1990s, the chief backer for his lower-priced line suddenly ran out of money.

“I remember thinking, ‘Well, if this doesn’t work, like, will I still be me? Will I still be Michael Kors? What will I do?’”

“It must have been so scary for you.”

“Scary. And what I learned from it is, you really have to stick to your guts. You know, you’ve got to stay focused.”

He rebuilt the brand, and then in 2004 he got a call that would change his life: “Certainly, reality television and fashion had not merged,” Kors said of “Project Runway.” “And I knew ‘Survivor.’ And I said, ‘Are designers gonna be, you know, eating bugs and killing each other? What are they gonna be doing?’ I thought it was insane!”

The show, which judged the work of aspiring designers, took off, in part, because of now-legendary quips by Kors like, “It’s tablecloth-y to me.”

But after 10 years, Kors left the show to spend more time on his business, and his marriage with Lance LaPere, his one-time intern who is now creative director of the company.

Braver asked LaPere, “Do you ever tell him, ‘I don’t think so, that’s not a good idea’?”

“Oh, yeah. All the time,” he replied. “It’s always a back and forth.”

And these days, with a net worth estimated at $1 billion, life is very bright for Michael Kors:

“I am still so curious about what is next, and what’s new,” he said. “I think when you lose that curiosity, you know, quite frankly, then you need to do something else. But I feel more juice today than I did when I was 21.”

276,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-an-artificial-intelligence-researcher-fears-about-ai/,cbsnews,What an artificial intelligence researcher fears about AI,['Arend Hintze'],"Arend Hintze is assistant professor of Integrative Biology & Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University.

As an artificial intelligence researcher, I often come across the idea that many people are afraid of what AI might bring. It's perhaps unsurprising, given both history and the entertainment industry, that we might be afraid of a cybernetic takeover that forces us to live locked away, ""Matrix""-like, as some sort of human battery.

And yet it is hard for me to look up from the evolutionary computer models I use to develop AI, to think about how the innocent virtual creatures on my screen might become the monsters of the future. Might I become ""the destroyer of worlds,"" as Oppenheimer lamented after spearheading the construction of the first nuclear bomb?

I would take the fame, I suppose, but perhaps the critics are right. Maybe I shouldn't avoid asking: As an AI expert, what do I fear about artificial intelligence?

Fear of the unforeseen

The HAL 9000 computer, dreamed up by science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke and brought to life by movie director Stanley Kubrick in ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" is a good example of a system that fails because of unintended consequences. In many complex systems – the RMS Titanic, NASA's space shuttle, the Chernobyl nuclear power plant – engineers layer many different components together. The designers may have known well how each element worked individually, but didn't know enough about how they all worked together.

That resulted in systems that could never be completely understood, and could fail in unpredictable ways. In each disaster – sinking a ship, blowing up two shuttles and spreading radioactive contamination across Europe and Asia – a set of relatively small failures combined together to create a catastrophe.

I can see how we could fall into the same trap in AI research. We look at the latest research from cognitive science, translate that into an algorithm and add it to an existing system. We try to engineer AI without understanding intelligence or cognition first.

Systems like IBM's Watson and Google's Alpha equip artificial neural networks with enormous computing power, and accomplish impressive feats. But if these machines make mistakes, they lose on ""Jeopardy!"" or don't defeat a Go master. These are not world-changing consequences; indeed, the worst that might happen to a regular person as a result is losing some money betting on their success.

But as AI designs get even more complex and computer processors even faster, their skills will improve. That will lead us to give them more responsibility, even as the risk of unintended consequences rises. We know that ""to err is human,"" so it is likely impossible for us to create a truly safe system.

Fear of misuse

I'm not very concerned about unintended consequences in the types of AI I am developing, using an approach called neuroevolution. I create virtual environments and evolve digital creatures and their brains to solve increasingly complex tasks. The creatures' performance is evaluated; those that perform the best are selected to reproduce, making the next generation. Over many generations these machine-creatures evolve cognitive abilities.

Right now we are taking baby steps to evolve machines that can do simple navigation tasks, make simple decisions, or remember a couple of bits. But soon we will evolve machines that can execute more complex tasks and have much better general intelligence. Ultimately we hope to create human-level intelligence.

Along the way, we will find and eliminate errors and problems through the process of evolution. With each generation, the machines get better at handling the errors that occurred in previous generations. That increases the chances that we'll find unintended consequences in simulation, which can be eliminated before they ever enter the real world.

Another possibility that's farther down the line is using evolution to influence the ethics of artificial intelligence systems. It's likely that human ethics and morals, such as trustworthiness and altruism, are a result of our evolution – and factor in its continuation. We could set up our virtual environments to give evolutionary advantages to machines that demonstrate kindness, honesty and empathy. This might be a way to ensure that we develop more obedient servants or trustworthy companions and fewer ruthless killer robots.

While neuroevolution might reduce the likelihood of unintended consequences, it doesn't prevent misuse. But that is a moral question, not a scientific one. As a scientist, I must follow my obligation to the truth, reporting what I find in my experiments, whether I like the results or not. My focus is not on determining whether I like or approve of something; it matters only that I can unveil it.

Fear of wrong social priorities

Being a scientist doesn't absolve me of my humanity, though. I must, at some level, reconnect with my hopes and fears. As a moral and political being, I have to consider the potential implications of my work and its potential effects on society.

As researchers, and as a society, we have not yet come up with a clear idea of what we want AI to do or become. In part, of course, this is because we don't yet know what it's capable of. But we do need to decide what the desired outcome of advanced AI is.

One big area people are paying attention to is employment. Robots are already doing physical work like welding car parts together. One day soon they may also do cognitive tasks we once thought were uniquely human. Self-driving cars could replace taxi drivers; self-flying planes could replace pilots.

Instead of getting medical aid in an emergency room staffed by potentially overtired doctors, patients could get an examination and diagnosis from an expert system with instant access to all medical knowledge ever collected – and get surgery performed by a tireless robot with a perfectly steady ""hand."" Legal advice could come from an all-knowing legal database; investment advice could come from a market-prediction system.

Perhaps one day, all human jobs will be done by machines. Even my own job could be done faster, by a large number of machines tirelessly researching how to make even smarter machines.

In our current society, automation pushes people out of jobs, making the people who own the machines richer and everyone else poorer. That is not a scientific issue; it is a political and socioeconomic problem that we as a society must solve. My research will not change that, though my political self – together with the rest of humanity – may be able to create circumstances in which AI becomes broadly beneficial instead of increasing the discrepancy between the one percent and the rest of us.

Fear of the nightmare scenario

There is one last fear, embodied by HAL 9000, the Terminator and any number of other fictional superintelligences: If AI keeps improving until it surpasses human intelligence, will a superintelligence system (or more than one of them) find it no longer needs humans? How will we justify our existence in the face of a superintelligence that can do things humans could never do? Can we avoid being wiped off the face of the Earth by machines we helped create?

The key question in this scenario is: Why should a superintelligence keep us around?

I would argue that I am a good person who might have even helped to bring about the superintelligence itself. I would appeal to the compassion and empathy that the superintelligence has to keep me, a compassionate and empathetic person, alive. I would also argue that diversity has a value all in itself, and that the universe is so ridiculously large that humankind's existence in it probably doesn't matter at all.

But I do not speak for all humankind, and I find it hard to make a compelling argument for all of us. When I take a sharp look at us all together, there is a lot wrong: We hate each other. We wage war on each other. We do not distribute food, knowledge or medical aid equally. We pollute the planet. There are many good things in the world, but all the bad weakens our argument for being allowed to exist.

Fortunately, we need not justify our existence quite yet. We have some time – somewhere between 50 and 250 years, depending on how fast AI develops. As a species we can come together and come up with a good answer for why a superintelligence shouldn't just wipe us out. But that will be hard: Saying we embrace diversity and actually doing it are two different things – as are saying we want to save the planet and successfully doing so.

We all, individually and as a society, need to prepare for that nightmare scenario, using the time we have left to demonstrate why our creations should let us continue to exist. Or we can decide to believe that it will never happen, and stop worrying altogether. But regardless of the physical threats superintelligences may present, they also pose a political and economic danger. If we don't find a way to distribute our wealth better, we will have fueled capitalism with artificial intelligence laborers serving only very few who possess all the means of production.

280,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/dave-chappelle-netflix-comedy-fame-leaving-chappelles-show/,cbsnews,"Dave Chappelle on fame, leaving ""Chappelle's Show"" and Netflix special",[],"For more than 30 years, Dave Chappelle has been making people laugh. He studied theater at a performing arts high school in Washington and started sneaking into comedy clubs when he was 14. His career exploded after two hilarious seasons of “Chappelle’s Show” on Comedy Central, and then famously walked away at the height of his success.

“I was talkin’ to a guy… he basically said to me that comedy is a reconciliation of paradox,” Chappelle told “CBS This Morning” co-host Gayle King. “And I think that that was a irreconcilable moment for me. That I was in this very successful place, but the emotional content of it didn’t feel anything like what I imagined success should feel like. It just didn’t feel right.”

Chappelle’s now back, this time with a three-part stand-up comedy special on Netflix, premiering Tuesday.

But Chappelle revealed he does miss his former show. “But ‘Chappelle’s Show’s’ like breakin’ up with a girl and you still like her. But in your mind you’re like, ‘That b**** is crazy. I’m not goin’ back,’” Chappelle said, chuckling.

Chappelle not only left the show, walking away from a $50 million deal, but he also left the country, going to South Africa to escape.

“Did the fame scare you?” King asked.

“Fame, yeah, but not so much that I get on a plane to Africa. Fame is not that kind of scary. But it is – fame is a horrifying concept when it’s aimed at you, you know?” Chappelle said. “At the end of the day, it’s so – you don’t have that much control over it. You just try to conduct yourself as best you can.”

For two seasons his best was Comedy Central’s “Chappelle’s Show.” It was critically acclaimed and wildly popular.

“Even when you walked away in 2005, you were still working. It’s just that we didn’t know all the things that you were doing. You really stayed low,” King said.

“I found an altitude I was comfortable with. I found a way that – to do what I liked to do and avoid some of the parts of it that I was uncomfortable with,” Chappelle said.

“What were you uncomfortable with?” King asked.

“Well, I mean, if you look at me, right, physically – now, I’m, like, 40 pounds heavier than I was when I did ‘Chappelle’s Show.’ And people are like, ‘How did you gain all that weight?’ By resting and eatin’ and payin’ attention to myself. I have actual relationships with my kids,” Chappelle said. “I’ve been all over the country, touring all my life. But I never saw anything. Now I’ve seen everything. I could talk to people or I could – I had time to stop if someone said they liked me. It wasn’t like I brushed past ‘em like, ‘I don’t want to hear it.’ I had time to stop like, ‘You do?’ You know what I mean? It’s like – it was just, like, the way that I engaged the world was different.”

He’s starting to get to a point, he said, where he’d like for his life to “mean something” – like when he went to Allen University in Columbia, South Carolina and wanted to talk to the students. His great-grandfather, Bishop William David Chappelle, was once president of the university.

“It’s okay to be afraid because you can’t be brave or courageous without fear. The idea of being courageous is that even though you are scared, you just do the right thing anyway. So in 2004, I walked away from $50 million and in November, I made a deal for $60 million,” he told the students in a speech at Chappelle Auditorium.

He also went to the church, Chappelle Memorial AME Church, also named after his great-grandfather, a piece of his family’s history he wanted to explore.

Chappelle’s own history is rooted in stand-up comedy. He started performing when he was only 14.

“Do you remember when you got your first laugh?” King asked.

“Yeah, first night I was on stage. I can remember who introduced me. I can remember what my introduction was. I can remember the whole thing,” Chappelle said. “This guy named J.T. Newton, he said, ‘You know, folks, everybody starts somewhere. And tonight this young man is doin’ stand-up comedy for the first time.’ He goes, ‘And who knows? We may be witnessing the birth of a star. Please welcome Dave Chapel [sic].’ That was it.”

“But I did pretty good. They were like screamin’. And he’s like, ‘That’s all for you, kid. That’s all for you.’ But they would treat it like I was in the Make a Wish Foundation or somethin’. And they just wanted to give me a little boost. But it was encouraging, man. And it felt so good, you know? You’ll go through a million bad nights to get those good ones,” Chappelle said.

His good nights now involve “Juke Joints” -- part concert, part party. All Dave.

“You never go to a party where everyone shows up at the same time. But the ‘Juke Joint’ is a kind of party where everyone shows up at the same time,” Chappelle said. “And we start and we finish the night together. And it’s just, like – it’s a very eclectic crowd.”

“What do you want us to feel in there?” King asked.

“It’s like, you know, love and camaraderie and kinship, you know? It’s just a reminder. Like, and my town is so small, you throw an event like that in town, it’s the big dance,” Chappelle said.

CBS News

That small town is about 20 miles outside of Dayton, Ohio, and far away from the pressure of big city life. Sometimes, Chappelle will walk on the streets at night.

“Especially when I first get back from the road if it’s nice out. Scary, too,” Chappelle said.

“Why?” King asked.

“Raccoons. You can hear ‘em, like, rustling in the woods,” Chappelle said.

“You scared of raccoons?” King asked.

“Yeah. Very much so,” he said. “That’s an irrational fear that I just have.”

The town is progressive and artsy, a place Chappelle said he’s treated like a neighbor – not a big star.

“Are you calmer here?” King asked.

“Generally speaking, yeah,” Chappelle said. “I have time to think about things. And I think for a comedian, if you don’t have time to think, you’re just not as effective. That if you-- you know, it gets a little corporate.”

It’s that corporate feel he left behind when he departed Comedy Central, where Key and Peele became the comedians to watch.

“I think there was a speculation that Dave doesn’t like Key & Peele or Dave thinks, ‘Okay,’” King said.

“No. I’m a fan of this show,” Chappelle said.

But when he was doing “Chappelle’s Show,” he said there were “certain conventions of the show that the network resisted.”

“I fought the network very hard so that those conventions could come to fruition,” Chappelle said. “So, like the first episode I do, that black white supremacist sketch. And it’s like, ‘Well, that’s 10 minutes long. It should be five minutes long.’ Why should it be five minutes long? Like, these types of conventions. I fought very hard. … So when I watch ‘Key & Peele’ and I see they’re doing a format that I created, and at the end of the show, it says, ‘Created by Key & Peele,’ that hurts my feelings.”

Right now he’s focused on his new creation: three highly anticipated, multi-million-dollar Netflix specials.

“You tell jokes from everything, from race to politics … do you worry about crossing the line or is there a line that you won’t cross?” King asked.

“Comedy is weird. The line, the line moves. It changes,” Chappelle said, adding, “but I think a lot of, especially in comedy, a lot of it has to do with intent.”

“And your intent is?”

“To make people laugh, to reconcile paradox. I’m, like, just openly – sometimes openly venting. I think that when you get to a certain altitude, there’s more scrutiny over the things you say, ‘cause the platform is so powerful,” Chappelle said."

French designer Sophie Theallet, who has dressed First Lady Michelle Obama, tweeted an open letter explaining why she’ll stay away from Melania Trump once she moves into the White House.

“As an independent fashion brand, we consider our voice an expression of our artistic and philosophical ideas. The Sophie Theallet brand stands against all discrimination and prejudice,” the letter says.

Open letter | Sophie Theallet | November 17th, 2016 pic.twitter.com/g1hIAyBmdF — sophie theallet (@sophietheallet) November 17, 2016

Theallet, an immigrant, admits she is “well aware it is not wise to get involved in politics,” but that the bottom line of her business is “not just about money” and she must stand by her values. Those values, she writes, do not align with “the rhetoric of racism, sexism, and xenophobia unleashed by [Donald Trump’s] presidential campaign.”

“I will not participate in dressing or associating in any way with the next first lady,” Theallet says. “I encourage my fellow designers to do the same.”

Designing for the first lady is a high honor in the fashion world, making Theallet’s appeal to her colleagues even more daring. But she is not the first designer to take a stand against the Trumps.

Kaelen Haworth, known for her creations for Blake Lively and Elizabeth Banks, announced after the election that proceeds from items sold on her website would be donated to organizations opposed by Trump. The list includes Planned Parenthood, Black Lives Matter, and Everytown for Gun Safety.

But not everyone is jumping off of the Trump Train, and those who have might buy another ticket soon, says fashion legend Carolina Herrera.

“I think that in two or three months they’ll reach out, because it’s fashion. You’ll see everyone dressing Melania. She’s representing the United States,” Herrera told Business of Fashion."

Sanders told reporters in a White House press briefing Wednesday that the White House and Department of Defense will work out the details, after the president surprised the political and even military world with the major policy shift he announced in tweets. But the ban leaves many questions unanswered, such as, what happens to current troops, and will they have to self-report their status and leave military? Sanders also offered no timeline for implementing the policy.

It's unclear how much the White House has consulted, or if it has consulted, with lawyers or the broader military community. The Pentagon is referring all questions back to the White House. Sanders repeatedly insisted the president made the ""difficult"" decision after speaking with his national security team and in the interest of ""military readiness.""

""The decision is based on a military decision,"" Sanders said. ""It's not meant to be anything more than that.""

The administration is already facing legal threats. OutServe-SLDN, which offers legal services for LGBT military members, has threatened to take the president to court if he pursues the policy. Other groups like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) are also pushing back against the announcement.

Former Defense secretary Ash Carter ended the ban on transgender people serving openly in the military last year, but permitted a one-year review process for the Pentagon to figure out how to accept new recruits.

Mr. Trump's policy announcement comes shortly after the House rejected an attempt to ban DOD spending on gender reassignment surgery, 209-214, with two Republicans joining Democrats to kill it.

The ban on transgenders in the military seems to contradict Mr. Trump's previous tweets supporting the LGBT community in the 2016 campaign, when he said he would ""fight for you while Hillary (Clinton) brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs."""

Netflix says it has ordered an adult animated comedy from Groening called ""Disenchantment,"" and it features several comedy all-stars from shows like ""Broad City"" and ""The Eric Andre Show.""

The cartoon will take place in the crumbling medieval kingdom of Dreamland, which is populated by hard-drinking princess Bean, her elf companion Elfo and her personal demon Luci. Along the way, Bean meets ogres, sprites, harpies, imps, trolls, walruses, and lots of human fools.

Behold, if you dare, the Israeli Deathstalker Scorpion. Its sting is excruciating, its venom can kill.

Sounds terrifying! But Dr. Jim Olson says, ""It's actually beautiful.""

Beautiful, because the Deathstalker's venom may revolutionize how cancer surgery is done.

Dr. Olson is a brain cancer physician and researcher at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, Washington.

""We were inspired by a 16-year-old girl who had a brain tumor,"" he said. ""After 12 hours of surgery, the surgeons left behind a big piece. And we decided that day to find a way to make the cancer light up so that surgeons could see it while they're operating.""

The key is the scorpion venom, synthetically reproduced, minus the poison. When injected into a patient's bloodstream, it sticks to cancer cells but NOT to normal cells. Combine that sticky molecule with florescent dye and you've got what Olson calls ""tumor paint.""

So what problem does tumor paint solve? ""Sometimes, it's really hard for a surgeon to tell what is cancer and what is normal,"" Dr. Olson said. ""And in the brain, you can't take out a big chunk of normal just to make sure you got the cancer. And tumor paint distinguishes clearly the difference between brain cancer and normal brain in all of our experiments that we've done so far.""

Check out this image of a cancerous tumor … inject tumor paint, and there's no mistaking it. The tumor lights up.

CBS News

""So this is definitive? I can see why you're excited about this,"" said Spencer.

""I am thrilled about this.""

""You're sort of turning nature upside down, right?""

""That's exactly what we're doing!"" he laughed.

Sounds a lot like science fiction, but Dr. Olson says it could be an FDA-approved reality as soon as 2019.

""I think this will potentially be the biggest improvement in cancer surgery, maybe, in 50 years,"" he said.

""God bless the Israeli Deathstalker scorpion!""

""Exactly, exactly. Well, and God bless our patients. Because, you know, they're the ones that motivate us to do this.""

Now, the actress is also bringing her wit and humor to commercials for Enterprise. She talked to CBS News about why her daughters don’t watch “Frozen,” her holiday plans and how she feels about the president-elect.

Tell me what was fun about making these commercials for Enterprise.

It was very collaborative. They were interested in how I interpreted the script. I got to add my own dialogue -- goofy things I would actually say or would find myself doing should I have the ability to run around like a child at any of the Enterprise locations and play with the vehicles.

Do you like driving?

I do. My husband actually races professionally often so it’s his turf but yes, I do.

What are your holiday plans?

We are staying home. We did a fair amount of traveling this year and we’re just hunkering down, watching Christmas movies and celebrating Christmas here with our family at our house in L.A.

Is “Frozen” a staple in your house?

No. They don’t actually watch “Frozen,” believe it or not! I put it on for them and it was a little too scary. They like the characters but they don’t really watch the movie. We do a lot of PBS Kids. Their attention span is not two hours as of yet, so we do the 11-minute TV show programs when they watch TV.

Do they understand that that’s you as Anna, though?

They do because we talk about it with them -- what we do for a living -- and they know there’s a real person behind the voices of the cartoons they watch and my daughter was watching a cartoon and said, “They’re not real, but there is a person behind them doing a voice.” And I was like, “Yeah, oh my gosh, you get this.”

She sounds really smart.

She knows Idina is Elsa. She knows Josh is Olaf. She’s able to associate humans with characters, which I think is rare for a three-year-old.

What can you tell us about “Frozen 2”?

I wish I knew. We haven’t seen anything yet. I thought we’d be recording by now but they’re still working on the script. But we did an Olaf special that comes out next Christmas and the music has been written for it.

There’s been a lot of talk about how “Frozen” really diverges from traditional princess stories and embraces strong women. How does it feel to be part of a project like that?

I feel proud. I don’t love stories that have just a bad guy and you never explore what made them bad or sad and “Frozen” did a great job with that. We talk with the kids about why the bad guy is sad and what made him sad and grumpy. I was really proud “Frozen” didn’t really have a villain, or at least not in Elsa. She was a very complex, misunderstood character. I was really proud of representing that story.

You represent lots of viewpoints on social media or in your art. You’ve talked about mental health, the Syrian refugee crisis, equal pay -- what’s been the best part of having the platform you have?

Just knowing I can be a voice for people who feel voiceless. There are important issues that many of us don’t see on a day-to-day basis in the comfort of our lives and I am definitely included in that. I don’t run into refugees here in L.A. but I stay abreast of what’s happening because people are important to me.

You were pretty vocal against Donald Trump during election season. Now that he’s our president-elect, how do you feel about moving forward?

I think it’s important to unify our country again. I think the most important thing is to listen, to hear other people and hear where they’re coming from. I think understanding people is the only thing that works.

Speaking of equal pay, was there a time in your career when you felt particularly discriminated against for being a woman?

In “Forgetting Sarah Marshall,”Jason Segel was the only one nude in the movie. I thought it was about time someone turned the tables and we had a little male nudity to balance all the female nudity in Hollywood. I thought that was an inspired choice."
286,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-details-emerge-on-linkin-park-frontman-chester-benningtons-suicide/,cbsnews,New details emerge on Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington's suicide,[],"LOS ANGELES -- New details have emerged on Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington's suicide.

Police in Palos Verdes Estates released audio Monday to The Associated Press of a hired driver's 911 call in the singer's death.

The driver told authorities he had pulled up for a pickup at Bennington's house and was alerted by a housekeeper that she had found Bennington's body hanging in a bedroom. Her loud sobs can be heard in the background of the call.

The driver told police he had not seen the body himself.

On Friday, the Los Angeles County coroner ruled his death a suicide by hanging. Watch Commander Lt. Rudy Molano said an autopsy was conducted on July 21.

Coroner office spokesman Ed Winter's confirmed last week that no drugs were evident in Bennington's room.

Bennington's suicide echoed that of his good friend, Chris Cornell, who hanged himself in May. He had a strong bond with Cornell and died on what would have been the Soundgarden singer's 53rd birthday on Thursday.

Members of Linkin said say their hearts were broken following the death of their lead singer. The rock band said ""shock waves of grief and denial are still sweeping through our family as we come to grips with what has happened"" and added that Bennington ""touched so many lives, maybe even more than you realized.""

Linkin Park had planned to launch a tour this week, but canceled it following Bennington's death. Their hits include ""In the End"" and ""Numb."""

288,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/louise-penny-how-writing-became-her-solace/,cbsnews,Louise Penny: How writing became her solace,[],"The loyalty of her millions of readers speaks volumes about the appeal of Louise Penny's mystery novels. Martha Teichner traveled to Penny's hometown to see for herself:

There should be a name for fans of Louise Penny's murder mysteries: The L Pack, or the Penny Posse maybe.

Minotaur

To say they come from far and wide in large numbers to attend her book events is no exaggeration. They've come all the way to the Canadian town of Knowlton, in the eastern townships of Quebec, where Penny lives, and her books are set.

""Some of you have come a great distance with me,"" Penny said to them, ""so I'm thrilled to meet each and every one of you.""

It's as if her readers want to immerse themselves in the setting of her books, which are as much about the backstories of her murders -- why people kill -- as whodunit. Penny has published 12. They now routinely debut at number 1 on the New York Times bestseller list, or close to it.

Her next, ""Glass Houses,"" comes out next month.

""My books are about many, many things, probably least of all murder,"" Penny said. ""They're about life. They're about choices, and taking responsibility for what you do. But really, I think at their heart, they're about love and friendship.""

And food. (Her characters all eat exceptionally well.)

The made-up village of Three Pines (which Penny, tongue-in-cheek, informs readers can't be found on any map, although her publisher has conveniently had one drawn) is meant to be a safe place -- a refuge or sanctuary for people who are lost.

CBS News

The name has historical significance. Legend has it, during the American Revolution, the trees were a signpost for loyalists to the British crown fleeing north to Canada, to safety. ""So what people would do is, they would plant a cluster of three pine trees on their home, when they were at the border, as a signal to these people that they were safe,"" Penny said. ""And that's how I got the name for the village.""

Her detective is Chief Inspector Armand Gamache. ""If I got lucky enough that the books were published and became a series, I didn't want to grow weary of my main character. So, I decided I would create a man I would marry,"" Penny said.

But before Penny herself managed to find Three Pines and all its inhabitants, she, too, was lost: ""I was drinking more and more and more. The phone never rang. The doorbell never sounded.""

She had it made, or so it seemed. From the age of 21, she was a reporter and then an anchor for CBC radio, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. But she was also a secret drunk. At 35, she walked into an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, and changed her life.

""I left that meeting never having to drink again,"" she told Teichner. ""It was unbelievable. The urge to drink, the need to drink disappeared.""

Not long afterward, she met and married Dr. Michael Whitehead, a noted pediatric hematologist more than 20 years her senior, who told her that he would support her if she quit her job to write. For five years she tried to write the Great Historical Novel.

But then: ""I looked at the bedside table, and very well represented there were crime novels. It was one of those moments where I just thought, Oh, maybe that's what I should write.""

That first book was called ""Still Life."" ""Quebec is a character, a very real character in the books,"" she said. ""There is a very keen sense of place.""

With each new book, Penny's following has grown, her fans seeking a piece of her fictional and real worlds -- the line between them often blurry.

CBS News

Readers are convinced Kelly Shanahan's bakery is the bakery in the books. ""People come in absolutely expecting that Louise Penny is here somewhere,"" Shanahan said.

And on this particular day, a Louise Penny sighting does indeed occur.

The local bookstore, Brome Lake Books, has become a stand-in for Myrna's New and Used Bookstore in the novels. ""We usually have at least three groups a day coming through, not counting the bus tours and things like that,"" said owner Danny McAuley. ""They're really looking for a connection to Louise. The books have touched them. They've touched them personally; they've been healed by the books.""

louisepenny.com

And Penny has been extraordinarily open about her own life. Each month for her website, she writes what reads like an intimate letter to a close friend. It was there, in 2014, that she disclosed her beloved husband, Michael, had been diagnosed with dementia, and then last fall that he had died.

""So many others have been down this road before Michael and me -- there's comfort in that,"" Penny said.

When fans show up for book signings, it's not just about the books.

One fan, Marie Josee Pilon, told Teichner, ""I love her books, but I love the individual. She's become part of a family.""

Louise Penny has never laid eyes on most of these people before, but they are not strangers. After all, she showed them the way to Three Pines, the sanctuary where she has now gone to find herself once more, in her sadness.

""The writing became a harbor, it became a solace,"" Penny said. ""It became a world I could control. Oddly enough, all the decisions I had made 12 years ago, about a place that I would like to live in and people I would choose as friends, turned out to be my saving grace.""

""It would prompt a firestorm,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).

Members of both parties are warning the president not to mess with Mueller.

""Firing Bob Mueller without cause is an attack on the rule of law,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).

CBS News

""It sort of looks paranoid to me,"" said Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee. ""If he fired Bob Mueller, I think you'd see a tremendous backlash response from both Democrats but also House Republicans.""

Respect for Mueller runs deep on Capitol Hill, especially among Republicans.

He was President George W. Bush's pick for FBI director, and served throughout the Bush presidency.

House Speaker Paul Ryan has had the same message for Mr. Trump since Mueller was tapped as special counsel in May: ""I think the best advice would be to let Robert Mueller do his job.""

Republicans were also stunned by the president's slam on their former Senate colleague Jeff Sessions, who is now attorney general.

""Jeff Sessions takes the job, gets into the job, recuses himself. I then have -- which, frankly I think is very unfair to the president,"" Mr. Trump told The New York Times.

Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley says Sessions was right to recuse himself.

""The attorney general can't be a wingman for a president. He's got to be very independent,"" Grassley said.

As for those attempts to dig up dirt on Mueller or his staff, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio says good luck.

""I don't think it's going to influence Bob Mueller's work one way or another,"" Rubio said. ""I'm pretty confident just knowing him and knowing the way he conducts himself he doesn't wake up in the morning and read those things and have them impact his ability to do his job. He's going to do his job.""

Some Republican aides on Friday praised the choice for new White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, emphasizing his poise and charisma. Others complained that Scaramucci has no experience with communications planning and strategy -- something they think this White House badly needs."

Without an increase in the debt limit, CBO said the Treasury can use extraordinary measures ""to continue borrowing and have sufficient cash to make its usual payments"" until that October deadline. The government has been relying on the extraordinary measures since mid-March when the suspension of the debt ceiling expired.

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin called on Congress in May to raise the debt limit before lawmakers leave for the summer in August and specified that it should be a ""clean"" increase -- a demand that the conservative Freedom Caucus has rejected.

Congress was able to wait until October in 2015, the last debt ceiling deadline, to raise it. It was part of a bipartisan budget agreement that also lifted spending levels for two years that applied to defense and non-defense domestic programs.

Budget experts expect the GOP-controlled Congress to produce a similar agreement this fall since Republicans need Democratic votes in the Senate to pass spending bills whose limits will stem from a budget agreement."

Tesla co-founder Elon Musk warned this month that AI is a ""fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization.""

""I keep sounding the alarm bell but, you know, until people see robots going down the street killing people they don't know how to react, 'cause it seems so ethereal,"" Musk said at the National Governors Association.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg criticized those comments, without referring to Musk by name, during a Facebook Live broadcast from his backyard.

""I think that people who are naysayers and kind of try to drum up these doomsday scenarios are – I don't understand it. It's really negative and in some ways I actually think it's pretty irresponsible,"" Zuckerberg said.

Musk fired back Tuesday in a tweet: ""I've talked to Mark about this. His understanding of the subject is limited.""

The editor of Fast Company magazine, Robert Safian, told ""CBS This Morning"" Wednesday, ""I think they're both right and they're both wrong.""

Safian pointed out that there are a lot of words used when referring to artificial intelligence, or the ability of computers to ""learn"" from a growing body of data to improve their accuracy over time. ""Artificial intelligence, machine learning, cognitive computing. We use different words to describe the same thing, sometimes we use the same word to describe different things. All this gets confusing in this way.""

Safian acknowledged that technological advances can make people ""anxious.""

He called Musk's concerns a ""doomsday-oriented scenario"" but also said that what the SpaceX CEO is really talking about is a need for ""more oversight and some sort of regulatory apparatus to make sure technology and AI develops in a certain way.""

The tech moguls' differing ""philosophical point of view"" also contributes to their disagreement on this issue, Safian said.

""Now, Mark Zuckerberg believes that – one of the things he loves about technology and software is you can constantly improve it. So if there's a problem we'll fix it. That's sort of Mark's approach to things,"" Safian said.

Despite their disagreement, both Musk's and Zuckerberg's businesses rely on the advancement of artificial intelligence.

""Remember Elon Musk is the guy who wants to, you know, have us live on other planets, right? And that may happen but it's a long time until that happens. What do we put in place between here and there to make sure this technology is used in an effective way. And that's really what Elon is trying to encourage us to think about,"" Safian said.

But that's what happened at 4 a.m. Saturday when a 15-pound bag of frozen pork landed on the Deerfield Beach home of Travis Adair and his family.

Adair said Thursday that the package hit his roof with a ""big bang."" He thought it was thunder, but his wife Jennie later went outside and found two bundles next to the house. His son Austin found three on the roof.

""It had to fall from the sky,"" Adair said. ""It was too heavy to throw on the roof."" The home is near three airports, so Adair thinks it fell from a plane.

The Federal Aviation Administration had no immediate comment Thursday.

Labeling on the package shows it originally belonged to Jim Williams, who lives 170 miles away in Myakka City, a rural town of 6,300 residents. Williams, who owns a company that prepares fields for planting, said Thursday he bought some pigs from some children at a county fair in January. He kept much of the meat and gave some away but he has no idea how any of it ended up on the Adairs' roof. He is not a pilot and doesn't own a plane.

""I would have thought 15 pounds of frozen meat falling from an airplane would have put a hole in the roof,"" Williams said.

His friend, Jimmy Fussell, who owns the butcher shop that processed the pigs for Williams, said the mystery, which was featured on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!,"" certainly ""beats hearing about all the politics going on."" And it has given everyone in Myakka City a laugh.

As for the meat, the Adairs threw it away -- though Williams has offered to throw the family a barbecue."
295,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/south-carolina-domestic-violence-law-unfair-to-gay-couples-court-rules/,cbsnews,"South Carolina domestic violence law unfair to gay couples, court rules",[],"COLUMBIA, S.C. -- People in same-sex relationships in South Carolina should get the same legal protections against domestic violence as heterosexual couples, the state's highest court ruled Wednesday, deeming a portion of the state's domestic violence law unconstitutional.

The court was asked to weigh in after a woman tried to get a protective order against her former fiancée, also a woman, and was denied.

Current law defines ""household members"" as a spouse, former spouse, people with a child in common, or men and women who are or have lived together. It does not include unmarried same-sex couples.

Acting Justice Costa Pleicones, who wrote the majority opinion, said during oral arguments in March 2016 that he felt the law was ""pretty clearly unconstitutional in its discriminatory impact upon same-sex couples.""

In his opinion, Pleicones pointed out lawmakers have over the years addressed the definition of ""household members"" as covered under domestic violence protections in 1994, amending the language from ""persons"" living together to ""male and female."" In 2015, during a massive overhaul of South Carolina's criminal domestic violence law, legislators made changes including increasing penalties for offenders but left the gender-based definition intact.

The U.S. Constitution's Equal Protection Clause, the court wrote, states, ""No state shall ... deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,"" such as a benefit offered to one class of person but not others.

""In this case, we cannot find a reasonable basis for providing protection to one set of domestic violence victims -- unmarried, cohabiting or formerly cohabiting, opposite-sex couples -- while denying it to others,"" the court wrote.

Other states have addressed this issue since the U.S. Supreme Court's 2015 decision legalizing gay marriage nationwide. The Ohio Supreme Court in 2016 adopted the use of gender-neutral references in family court cases. California and Massachusetts proactively changed language in their laws.

Beth Littrell, an attorney with Lambda Legal, said while it would be great for state legislatures across the country to update language to protect same-sex couples in domestic violence situations, courts like South Carolina's should be commended for ensuring laws were applied equally.

""The Supreme Court of South Carolina absolutely came down on the right side of the law and of history,"" she said. ""Same-sex couples should be treated and recognized by the law as entitled to equal dignity. That's what the U.S. Supreme Court said, and now that what the South Carolina Supreme Court has said.""

Attorney General Alan Wilson, whose office argued the case on behalf of the state, said he would ask the court to reconsider its ruling. In a statement, Wilson said he supports an approach to ""reconcile our state's domestic violence laws with U.S. Supreme Court precedent"" but that his office has defended the constitutionality of the current law, which only allows the state to protect spouses, former spouses and people with children in common.

Bakari Sellers, a former legislator and an attorney for the woman who brought the case, told the Associated Press that the case was an opportunity to push South Carolina forward.

""We all know that South Carolina is usually a few decades behind the rest of the union, but that it takes good people of all walks of life to set aside prejudice and preconceived notions,"" Sellers said. ""Today, love won."""
