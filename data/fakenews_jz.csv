Seems like a forced apology won’t be enough for Kathy Griffin after shocking the world with a graphic photo shoot holding a bloody, decapitated Trump head.

After a day of deliberation, CNN has announced that Griffin will not be rejoining the network for her marquis hosting gig: Co-Host of CNN’s New Year’s Eve broadcast from Time Square.

CNN’s public relations Twitter account broke the news Wednesday afternoon:

CNN has terminated our agreement with Kathy Griffin to appear on our New Year's Eve program. — CNN Communications (@CNNPR) May 31, 2017

The decision came as many were hammering the network for employing Griffin. One of those calling for her immediate removal was The President’s own son, Donald Jr who laid into the network, asking if they had the “moral/ethical standards” to discontinue their relationship with Griffin.

As of early Wednesday, according to CNN, the network was “evaluating” her future at the network:

CNN said it was evaluating the matter and had made “no decisions at this point.” “We found what she did disgusting and offensive,” a CNN spokesperson said. “We are pleased to see she has apologized and asked that the photos be taken down.”

The comedian has seen other financial and career repercussions for her photo shoot with a bloody, decapitated Trump head.

Griffin has been dropped as the official spokeswoman for Squatty Potty, a position she gained just weeks ago, and the ad campaign that featured her prominently has been removed from the company’s site.

The leadership inside the Squatty Potty company was horrified by Griffin’s decision to pose with the decapitated Trump head.

According to a statement given to Ad Week:

We were shocked and disappointed to learn about the image Ms. Griffin shared today. It was deeply inappropriate and runs contrary to the core values our company stands for,” Squatty Potty CEO Bobby Edwards said in a statement shared with Adweek. “In response, Squatty Potty has suspended its ad campaign featuring Ms. Griffin. We have acted swiftly and decisively to demonstrate our commitment to a culture of decency, civility and tolerance.

The full statement, according to BuzzFeed’s Jon Passantino:

The Trump family has also lashed out at the comedian.

President Trump called the act “sick,” followed by gut-wrenching tales of the President’s 11-year-old son seeing the images for the first time.

Time will tell if Squatty Potty and CNN won’t be the last to drop Griffin.

A Texas judge sentenced a man who sexually assaulted and infected two young girls to life in prison.

David R. Wilson, 33, was already a convicted pedophile when he molested his 23-month-old niece and another 14-year-old girl,

He had previously spent four years in jail for sexual assault when he took in his young niece because her parents were habitual drug users.

In November 2014, medical officials discovered the child had genital injuries that required reconstructive surgery.

After she tested positive for a variety of STDs, including HIV, chlamydia and genital herpes, authorities were notified.

Upon conducting tests on all four people who lived in the child’s household, it was clear who was the suspect: her uncle, who also had STDs.

Although he had chlamydia and a relevant criminal history, authorities did not arrest him.

Around the same time, a 14-year-old girl informed authorities Wilson had sexually assaulted her. She tested positive for several STDs and was also pregnant.

The victim was sexually assaulted inside Wilson’s pickup truck, the statement by the Houston Police Department says. The victim also told police she was sexually assaulted by Wilson on several other occasions.

“Wilson admitted to investigators he sexually assaulted the victim numerous times over the past couple of years and also had intimate relations with several unidentified females,” the report added.

Wilson was charged with “super aggravated sexual assault” — an enhanced charge because of the age of the younger victim, his niece.

The jury took an hour to find Wilson guilty. He was sentenced to life in prison.

“It’s a monster that does this kind of crime, this guy doesn’t deserve one minute less than the maximum punishment,” said legal analyst Joel Androphy."

Why support President Trump’s Immigration Ban? 19 MUSLIM IMMIGRANTS KILLED 2,977 AMERICANS September 11, 2001

The county, which has voted Republican since it went for a fourth term for Franklin Roosevelt in 1944, is deep in western North Carolina in NASCAR and bluegrass territory, and many of its residents find the message to be contrary to the Christian values that are the bedrock of the small town communities within the county.

President Trump won Catawba County 66.8 percent to Hillary Clinton’s 29.3 percent, so it might have been expected that the residents would support his travel ban, but their staunch religious beliefs appear to override any concern about the dangers posed by unvetted immigration.

The North Carolina Pastors Network is noted on the billboard as the sponsor and stands by the message despite some residents finding it offensive and even “unchristian.”

Residents of nearby Claremont and Catawba are talking about the sign on Interstate 40 that traverses the state from the Raleigh-Durham area through Winston-Salem and west to Knoxville, Tennessee.

Oliver Reitzell opposes the billboard on religious grounds.

“I believe in the Christian way, and that’s to embrace everybody. Kind of the hate message behind it, I’m not for that.”

An associate pastor at the Corinth Reformed Church in the town of Hickory goes a step further and says the billboard actually contradicts Biblical teaching and sees the presence of non-Christians as an opportunity to preach the gospel to them.

“My opinion is that I think these people need the saving gospel of Jesus more than I need to be protected,” Cummings said But Paul Cummings

“I’m perfectly willing for people who are hostile to us to be in our country, because that’s what loving your enemy is all about.”

Evangelist Dave Kistler, who heads up the North Carolina Pastors Network disagrees and says there is “nothing hateful” in the message on the billboard.

“Some have interpreted it to be that and say that. It was not. It is the truth.”

Huntington Beach California was the scene of one of President Trump’s iconic Make America Great Again rallies today. The crowd blanketed the area with American flags, Blue Lives Matter flags and red MEGA hats.

Unfortunately, their joyful rally attracted an undesirable element as well.

The so-called “anti-fascist” appeared wearing masks and hoods with signs and banners of their own. Little did they know that the Trump supporters had shown up loaded for bear.

This was the scene before the trouble makers made their appearance.

When the thugs showed up, though, the pro-America crowd didn’t back down. The two lines clashed with mostly verbal attacks at first."

The 2017 Chevrolet Cruze Diesel sedan has been EPA-rated 30/52/37 mpg (city/highway/combined) when equipped with the six-speed manual transmission. Based on those numbers, GM estimates the Cruze Diesel has a range of up to 702 miles on one tank.

The Cruze Diesel is powered by a 1.6-liter turbodiesel I-4 that makes 137 hp and 240 lb-ft of torque. In addition to the six-speed manual, the diesel is also offered with a nine-speed automatic, which is rated at 31/47/37 mpg. Chevy calls the 52-mpg highway number “segment-best,” but with Volkswagen’s Jetta TDI sidelined by the company’s diesel emissions scandal, it’s difficult to make any apples-to-apples comparisons. Both manual and automatic EPA estimates best the previous Cruze Diesel’s 27/44/32 mpg result, however. That car was powered by a 151-hp, 256-lb-ft 2.0-liter turbodiesel I-4 mated to a six-speed automatic.

Not surprisingly, the diesels’ fuel economy ratings also come in higher than their gas counterparts. The standard 2017 Chevrolet Cruze is powered by a turbocharged 1.4-liter I-4 that’s rated 30/40/34 mpg with the six-speed automatic and 28/39/32 mpg with the six-speed manual.

The 2017 Chevrolet Cruze Diesel sedan starts at $24,670, including $875 destination. The Cruze Diesel hatchback will arrive for the 2018 model year. Pricing and EPA estimates have not yet been announced for that model.

Remember the patent images of Benelli’s twin-cylinder powered motorcycle which were leaked around a year ago? Now the bike has taken the shape of reality and it has been spotted on showcase somewhere in China in showroom-like surroundings. The model in the images looks ready to roll out in the market and it has been speculated to be called “Benelli 750GS” as it carries the same moniker on its rear cowls.

The Benelli GS750 seems based on a completely new platform that uses a trellis frame, providing it with an appearance that looks much inspired by the popular Ducati Monster series. Moreover, the shape of the headlamp and the tail section also seem to share design cues with the Ducati Monster 696.

Powering the upcoming Italian machine will be the liquid-cooled, parallel-twin engine that was showcased by Benelli at last year’s EICMA show in Milan, Italy. Though it shares the basic design with the existing three-cylinder motor of the company, the entire internal geometry has been redesigned. As per the manufacturer, the motor has been claimed to deliver 98.3PS at 10,000rpm and a peak torque of 63.7Nm at 8000rpm. The figures look quite impressive, however, we can’t say anything with surety about the performance of the upcoming motorcycle.

Looking at the pictures of the Benelli 750GS, we can see features like beefy USD forks at the front, rear monoshock, projector headlamps, meaty tyres, dual front disc brakes, digital instrument cluster and much more. However, the in-depth feature details will come out only with the unveiling of the model. All we can say right now is the Italian manufacturer will definitely try to bring this new model in a very competitive price bracket that will position it as a very strong player in most of the markets. The product will challenge offerings such as the new Kawasaki Z650, Ducati Monster 797 and the Triumph Street Triple.

Maddow said, “Vice President Mike Pence has made a number of blunt direct false statements related to the Trump Russia investigation both during the transition and since he was vice president.

When controversy started to swirl around Mike Flynn because of his foreign contacts, Mike Pence bluntly asserted that the Trump transition did not apply for a security clearance for Mike Flynn’s son. They had actually applied for a security clearance for Mike Flynn’s son.

After the president fired the FBI Director, Mike Pence bluntly asserted that the decision to fire James Comey.

Was based on a recommendation from the Deputy Attorney General. The President himself and reportedly the Deputy Attorney General himself now today have both made clear that that was not the reason James Comey was fired.”

Breaking: Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump Busted for Criminal Activity Rachel Maddow listed other Pence lies like saying there were no Trump campaign contacts with the Russian government, and how it can’t be true that Pence didn’t know that Flynn was under investigation. The central question around Pence is how Flynn stayed around as national security adviser after he lied to Pence. Comey Agrees to Testify on One Condition – Read Now Maddow concluded, “Mike Pence apparently formed a political action committee this week. Maybe he’s looking at his bosses troubles in the Russia scandal, and starting to imagine himself becoming president? Mike Pence has his own troubles when it comes to this scandal. And as long as reporters like the ones who work at Reuters. Keep turning up 18 new previously undisclosed Russian contacts during the campaign that the White House hadn’t come clean about before even now. It seems like those troubles are going to get bigger, not smaller over time.”



As I have been writing for months, Mike Pence is going to go down for the Russia scandal. As early as January 2017, it became clear that if the Russia scandal blew up, Pence wouldn’t survive it.

Anyone who has been paying attention for the last four months knows that Pence is up to his eyeballs in the Russia scandal. Republicans are fantasizing about Pence becoming president. But the reality is that if Trump is impeached, Mike Pence’s political career is dead as a doornail.

This was evidenced recently as he went along with the left’s narrative of a “collusion” between Trump and the Russians while under oath, even though there still remains zero evidence to back up this ridiculous nonsense. Well now in a sick story just making headlines, a young teenage sexual abuse victim is going public with the highly disturbing that that happened to her last year when the ‘Weinergate’ scandal was rocking Hillary Clinton’s campaign that’s sure to put Comey’s name on America’s $h*t list even further.

For whatever reason, disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner just can’t stop snapping pics of his junk and sending it to underage girls. His latest victim was a 15-year-old girl that Weiner had preyed upon, knowing full-well that the girl was udnerage and still in high school. But not long after enduring being targeted by a nasty Weiner, she was abused yet again after what FBI Director James Comey did to her throughout the ‘Weinergate’ scandal. In a scathing letter, the teen said that Comey “victimized” her and through his reckless actions, “helped the abuse at the hands of Anthony Weiner to continue.”

After grilling the teenager for 7 several long hours over the horrifying ordeal, rather than protecting her identity, Comey they released her name to the press, where she then became the target of their incessant requests for information. She was then the target of vicious attacks, having to relive the embarrassing ordeal over and over. Check out her scathing letter, which is now starting to go viral:

Mr. James Comey

FBI Director

I am the 15-year-old (now 16) who was the victim of Anthony Weiner. I now add you to the list of people who have victimized me. I told my story originally to protect other young girls that might be a victim of online predators.

Your letter to Congress has now brought this whole matter back into the media spotlight. Not even 10 minutes after being forensically interviewed with the FBI for seven hours, I received a phone call from a REPORTER asking for a statement. Why didn’t you communicate with the local FBI agents that I had just spoken to? They could have scheduled our interview sooner or scheduled a time to interview me later, or change locations of the interview. My neighborhood has been canvassed by reporters asking for details about me.

In your letter, you chose to use a vague approach, meaning the media had to keep searching to try and find out what evidence you had uncovered and how. Every media outlet from local to national has contacted me and my family to get my “story.” Why couldn’t your letter have waited until after the election, so I would not have to be the center of attention the last week of the election cycle?

In his “cooperation” with you and with his love of the spotlight, Anthony Weiner has given information that led to the media finding me. You have assisted him in further victimizing me on every news outlet. I can only assume that you saw an opportunity for political propaganda.

I thought your job as FBI Director was to protect me. I thought if I cooperated with your investigation, my identity as a minor would be kept secret. That is no longer the case. My family and I are barraged by reporters’ phone calls and emails. I have been even been blamed in a newspaper for causing Donald Trump to now be leading in some polls and costing Hillary the election.

Anthony Weiner is the abuser. Your letter helped that abuse to continue. How can I rebuild my life when you have made finding out my “story” the goal of every reporter? When I meet with my therapist next time, she will already know what we are going to talk about before I get there by reading Friday, October 28th, 2016’s New York Times article.

I may have been Weiner’s victim, but the real story here is that I am a survivor. I am strong, intelligent, and certain that I will come out from under this nightmare, but it will not be as a result of your doing your job to protect me. I hope that by making my letter to you public, you will think about how your actions affect the victims of the crimes you are investigating. The election is important, yes, but what happened to me and how it makes me feel and how others see me, is much more important. It’s time that the FBI Director puts his victims’ rights above political views.

— Girl that lost her faith in America

P.S. To all reporters: AP, FOX, CBS, NBC, and all other media outlets, please respect my position and stop interrupting my life!

Just goes to show that these slime-balls in Washington have no interest in serving the American people, but protecting their own political endeavors. Share if you think FBI Director James Comey should be removed from his position! This is yet another shining example of why this idiot should not be at the helm leading the FBI!

According to Haynes, Durant can opt out after the first year.

USA Today‘s Sam Amick noted how much money Durant is leaving on the table:

Typo on option, obviously. Durant will sign a one-plus-one, with a player option for 2018-19. $25 million 1st yr (Max would've been 34.5) — Sam Amick (@sam_amick) July 3, 2017

Amick reported that if Andre Iguodala had left, Durant would have taken even less money to ensure the Warriors signed forward Rudy Gay.

Durant ended a high-profile trip into free agency last summer by confirming his intention to join the Warriors on July 4. He signed a two-year pact worth just over $54.2 million, which gave him the option to re-enter the open market after his first season with the Dubs.

The 28-year-old Washington, D.C., native stated the structure of the contract had nothing to do with looking for an early escape route, per Amick.

“I plan on being here,” Durant said. “I don’t want to go through that again.”

Amick noted the 2013-14 NBA Most Valuable Player reaffirmed that commitment to Golden State during a conversation in January about his old team, the Oklahoma City Thunder.

“I’m liking it here,” he said. “I’m liking everything that’s going on. I know what my contract says, but I didn’t plan on coming here for just a year. I’m in it right now, and I’m also just focusing on day by day.”

Durant averaged 25.1 points, 8.3 rebounds, 4.8 assists, 1.6 blocks and 1.1 steals in his first year playing alongside Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson. He was limited to 62 games due to a knee injury but returned for the team’s postseason run.

His strong play continued in the playoffs to help the Warriors capture their second championship in the past three years. He checked in at 28.5 points, 7.9 rebounds and 4.3 assists across 15 games and earned the NBA Finals MVP award after the team’s five-game triumph over the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Meanwhile, the issue of Durant’s contract slowly moved back into the spotlight, even though he remained firm in his desire to stick with the Dubs throughout the campaign.

The Warriors and the latest addition to their star-studded Big Four were able to work out an agreement on a new deal, taking the place of his old agreement and next season’s player option. While it’s not a surprise, it does ensure there won’t be any late change of heart by the forward.

Playing alongside such a talented supporting cast allowed Durant to play a career-low 33.4 minutes during the regular season. That number could dip even closer to 30 minutes during the course of the deal as the team looks to keep him fresh.

All told, with Durant now guaranteed to remain in the fold, the Warriors should once again head into next season as the clear favorite to capture the NBA title.

Dutch beer company Heineken is now shipping their beer with a sick message on the back. The multibillion-dollar brewer is calling for “a world without borders or barriers.”

Heineken is the latest multinational corporation to join in the push to erode national sovereignty and open all international borders.

Marketing executives at Heineken are hoping their brand is capable of shifting public opinion and convincing consumers around the globe to open their borders to share some beer.

While the marketing campaign appears on the surface to be a misguided attempt to pander to liberals around the world, it is actually in the best interests of the mega-corporation.

Many multinational firms are hoping to open borders in an attempt to drive down wages in developed countries. Heineken could save millions on labor as hordes of unskilled workers flock to steal European jobs.

However, the propaganda campaign will ultimately backfire, as many are planning to boycott the beer brand for promoting their globalist scheme.

Worse yet is the simplicity of the message on the back of the bottle. If you believe Heineken, opening the borders is simply the nice thing to do. According to Heineken, the world is not full of evil terrorists and dogmatic sadists, but potential friends blocked by those pesky borders.

In reality, the world is a very dangerous place. Heineken and the liberals who share their view are utterly ungrateful of the sacrifices of our ancestors. We have managed to achieve the safest and prosperous society in the history of man, and the globalists hope to erode our success to prevent hurting the feelings of murderous goat herders.

An open world may benefit Heineken’s bottom line, but it will expose us to the evils of the world. We cannot sacrifice our safety in the name of corporate profits.

We need to join with the others boycotting the domineering beer maker. We need to show corporations that they serve us, their customers, and cannot push their political propaganda without consequence."

The poll says, 56 percent of the registered voters deemed the order a ” terrorist hot spot restriction,” while 37 percent said it is more likely “Muslim Ban.”

Although more than half of the those polled do not believe the move was not an attempt to discriminate based on religion, a majority of the country disapproves of the executive order. Forty-six percent supported Trump’s Jan. 27 immigration order, according to Washington Examiner.

1,013 registered voters nationwide voted through landline and cellphone interviews. The poll was conducted by the Anderson Robbins Research and Shaw & Company Research. The survey’s margin of error was three percentage points for all registered voters.

Majority has always sided with Trump. All true patriotic Americans. And yes, we side with President Trump! Let him fix this and get on with the ban, he knows what he is doing!

But what happens when a group refuses to show respect to their neighbors? What if newcomers want to destroy the traditions and values of long-standing Americans?

That’s when you need to stand up and prove you won’t be intimidated by anyone. Just ask these farmers.

When an Islamic group moved in next door and told Craig Baker the pigs on his family’s 200-year-old Texas farm had to go, he and his swine decided to fight back.

In protest of being asked to move, Davis began staging elaborate pig races on Friday afternoons — one of the Islamic world’s most holy days.

Craig’s neighbors, the Katy Islamic Association, have plans to build a mosque and community compound on the 11 acres they purchased alongside his farm. Baker, 46, a stone-shop owner whose family has owned the farm for two centuries, says the association knew about the pigs when they bought the property, and it’s not fair for them to ask him to get rid of the animals… Neighbors have been showing support for Baker’s races, even coming in the pouring rain and giving donations ranging from $100 to $1000 to sponsor the events. Last Friday, more than 100 attended the pig races, and many say they don’t want the mosque either. Some fear it will appear out of place and hurt their property values. This story is from a few years ago. I wonder how radical leftists would react to such an event today? Most likely they’d freak out and protest this farm. They’d fight for the rights of the Muslim group, while ignoring the rights of the 200-year old, family-owned farm. Imagine the audacity of a group like this. They demanded that the farm be moved, simply because it offended them. So what? America is about freedom. A family has the right to raise their pigs on the same land they’ve had for over 200 years. Just because that offends a religious group doesn’t mean they must move. If Muslims are to get along with other Americans, they need to accept their ways of life. We don’t have to bend just to accommodate their strict rules. Yet time and again we find they demand from us what they are not willing to give."

For $400,000, you can buy a very nice Rolls-Royce Dawn. Or you can purchase something slightly less sleek but more versatile: a flying car.

Dutch company PAL-V is now taking orders for the world’s first commercial flying car, the Liberty. The company says that the Liberty models are fully compliant with safety regulations set by global governing bodies, and that deliveries will begin by the end of 2018.

The first 90 copies are designated as Pioneer Editions, boasting special exterior and interior details. For the personalized touch and additional standard features such as power heating, buyers will have to pay $599,000. After the Pioneer Edition sells out, PAL-V will start selling the standard model, known as the Liberty Sport, for $399,000.

“PAL-V deliberately chose to engineer, design and build a flying car with proven technologies and fully compliant with existing regulations,” the company said in a press release today. “This leads to a first product delivery date that is realistic and imminent.” PAL-V expects North America to be a major market for its flying car.

Buyers should have a license for both driving and flying. On the road, the Liberty can lower its suspension and make use of its tilting cockpit for better maneuverability. PAL-V lists top speed on the road as 100 mph, while 0-62 mph is estimated to take less than 9 seconds. In the air, it can travel at up to 112 mph.

PAL-V may be the first company to bring a flying car to market, but it isn’t the only one in the game. Airbus is another potential player and says it will have a prototype by the end of the year.

Do you think PAL-V’s flying car will take off in the U.S.? Tell us in the comments below.

Boston Marathon Bomber Tsarnaev Severely Injured In Prison, May Never Walk Or Talk Again

Infamous Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 22, was the victim of an “unfortunate accident” yesterday at Ft. Devens Detention Center in Massachusetts, just a few short months after his high-profile trial and sentencing, according to warden Paul Jacobson.

Corrections officers reportedly found the terror suspect face down in a pool of his own blood in his cell; a banana peel was found on the floor nearby.

“It initially appeared as though Tsarnaev slipped on a discarded banana peel and hit the floor with such force that his head bounced off the hard tile surface, probably 16 or 17 times.

There was blood everywhere – all over the walls, the floor, even the toilet.

The injuries have caused massive brain trauma,” said prison investigator Joe Goldsmith.

“We determined though, through expert analysis, that it would be impossible for these injuries to have occurred through a fall.

Our investigation has shown that that it was the Aryan Brotherhood who initiated an attack on Tsarnaev.”

“Yes, it was the brotherhood who took care of that bomber,” said Miles Smith, head of the Aryan Nation inside Devens.

“The other gangs, they wanted him, too.

We paid the guards the most money to have a shot. They stood aside, and let us do what we do.

On the way out, they shook our hands, told us ‘Thank you.’ Well, You’re welcome. You’re welcome, Boston. You’re welcome, America!”

“Normally, an attack this violent, this cruel, on another inmate would get any offending party more time added to their sentence”

said warden Jacobson.

“Because of the nature of Tsarnaev’s crimes, though, we have decided to actually reduce the sentences of the Aryan members who were involved.

They have done our prison and our country a great service, and we appreciate it immensely.

They are heroes in the eyes of not only this institution, but also in the eyes of the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.”

Tsarnaev had pled not guilty to all thirty charges filed against him

but was found guilty on all counts in April. He was sentenced to the death penalty per the crimes committed.

According to Politico, Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin said Thursday that China’s Bank of Dandong had been blacklisted for being a “foreign financial institution of primary money laundering concern.”

“This bank has served as a gateway for North Korea to access the U.S. and international financial systems, facilitating millions of dollars of transactions for companies involved in North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs,” Mnuchin said.

“The United States will not stand for such action. This will require U.S. banks to ensure that the Bank of Dandong does not access the U.S. financial system directly or indirectly through other foreign banks.”

In addition to targeting the Bank of Dandong, the Treasury Department also sanctioned another company — Dalian Global Unity Shipping Co. Ltd — and two Chinese individuals for their dealings with the North Koreans.

According to Reuters, Wei Sun was sanctioned for his connections to the Foreign Trade Bank of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Hong Ri Li for links to Song Hyok Ri, a North Korean banking executive.

“While today’s actions are directed at Chinese individuals and entities, we look forward to working closely with the government of China to stop illicit financing involving North Korea. We are in no way targeting China with these actions,” Mnuchin said.

However, this past Wednesday, a White House official said that China was “falling far short of what it could bring to bear on North Korea in terms of pressure,” according to The New York Times.

Whether or not Mnuchin’s claim that the sanctions weren’t targeting China itself was just for public consumption, it’s clear that the Trump administration is looking to put pressure on North Korea in any way possible, and that includes putting pressure on their biggest partner.

Kristina Buhrman – an eighth-grade math teacher and substitute bus driver at Discovery Academy in Lake Alfred, Florida – told CNN she was just doing her job when she saved 38 middle school students from a burning bus.

While she was driving the bus towards school, she noticed smoke was coming from it, but at first didn’t think anything of it. That is, until one student in the back of the bus screamed:

“Ms. Buhrman, there’s smoke coming out of my seat.”

Not a second later, she sprung into action, pulling over the bus and evacuating all of the students.

“Once I got them off the bus, then I moved them down, and there was a ravine down there or like a drainage ditch, so I had to try to get them into a straight line to get them across the drainage ditch without falling into the drainage ditch,” she said.

CNN

The evacuation occurred just in time – the bus burst into flames as the last students were de-boarding bus.

CNN

Buhrman recalls that every kid that got off the bus said thank you to her.

CNN

As she drove home later that day, she passed by the singed bus as it was being loaded onto the tow truck.

“That’s when it hit me. Hard… That could have been really bad. It could have been horribly bad,” she said.

But she knows that she couldn’t have done what she did with a little help. She told CNN:

“After the bus fire, I had received a call saying that a photographer had taken a picture of the bus and they said when I was ready I could view it. So I opened it up, and there was a picture of a rainbow over the bus; however, it wasn’t raining… I immediately started crying because like I knew that we were being taken care of.”

Twitter

Buhrman talked about her motivation behind her actions — “We’re put in certain places, and if we’re not helping other people, what are we on earth for?”

It looks like the Bentley Bentayga won’t have the luxury SUV crown for much longer, at least not without a fight. The upcoming Rolls-Royce Cullinan SUV was once again spied during testing, this time in a frosty winter environment. Following a preview earlier last year, this is one of the best looks we’ve gotten at the all-terrain Rolls.

Not much is known about the Cullinan, but the SUV will debut a new aluminum-intensive platform that will underpin all future Rolls-Royce models, including the next Ghost and Phantom. The camouflaged prototype sports proportions similar to a full-size Range Rover. The trademark upright radiator grille makes it clear this is Rolls’ SUV, however.

Underneath the slab-sided styling likely beats one of Rolls’ twin-turbocharged V-12 engines, sending power to all four wheels through an automatic transmission. We imagine it’s unlikely owners will be rock crawling in their very, very expensive SUV, but the Cullinan could prove to be quite capable off-road.

Aside from the Bentayga, the Cullinan will be the only other SUV available in the segment until the Aston Martin DBX and the Mercedes-Maybach SUV arrive.

Take a look at the future of Rolls-Royce in the photo gallery below.

Maybe none,” he said. In verbal retaliation, Germany’s economy minister said the US needs to build better-quality cars if it wants to sell overseas.

The reality is that BMW already builds a lot of cars here — thousands more than it sells in the US. Another reality is that four US nameplate automakers actually have better long-term reliability than BMW, Audi, or Mercedes-Benz. Including Chevrolet.

Charge and counter-charge

Trump took time off from picking his cabinet and blasting Saturday Night Live to give an interview with The Times of London. “Germany is a great country, great manufacturing country — you go down Fifth Avenue everybody has a Mercedes-Benz in front of their building, right — the fact is that it’s been very unfair to the US, it’s not a two-way street,” he said, adding, “How many Chevrolets do you see in Germany? Maybe none — not too many — how many — you don’t see anything over there — it’s a one-way street — it’s gotta be a two-way street.”

When asked if German automakers should be building more cars in the US, Trump said, “I would tell BMW if they think they’re gonna build a plant in Mexico and sell cars into the US without a 35 percent tax, it’s not gonna happen, it’s not gonna happen — so if they want to build cars for the world I would say wish them luck — they can build cars for the US but they’ll be paying a 35 percent tax on every car that comes into the country.”

In an interview with the German newspaper Bild, Sigmar Gabriel, Germany’s economy minister and vice-chancellor said, “The American car industry is getting worse, weaker, and more expensive. … The US needs to build better cars” if Americans are choosing German cars over American.

The reality: BMW is America’s biggest car exporter

What Trump apparently didn’t know is that BMW Group (the umbrella for BMW, Mini, and Rolls-Royce) is a model for exporting cars from the US. The BMW factory in Spartanburg is BMW’s largest facility in the world, with the most volume: 411,171 BMWs built there last year, versus 365,204 BMWs and Minis sold in the US. Nobody exports more cars from the US — not Ford, not GM, not the Chrysler arm of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles: 287,700 BMW vehicles last year, or 70% of production, and 3.7 million vehicles since the plant opened in 1996.

Every BMW SUV (except the subcompact X1) is built in one factory – Spartanburg — then shipped to the 140 countries where BMWs are sold. Mercedes builds SUVs and compact C-Class cars at a factory in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and is building a factory for Sprinter vans in Charleston, SC.

Nobody is like the Germans when it comes to creating sport-luxury vehicles that handle well at insanely high speeds, which may play against more softly sprung Buicks selling well in Germany (in China, they sell briskly). But Americans do make some US-flagged cars that are more reliable. The J.D. Power 2016 Vehicle Dependability Study, which measures problems encountered per 100 vehicles after three years of ownership, has Lexus and Porsche running 1-2. Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW are clustered at 11-12-14, slightly better than average. But the vehicles of five US-flagged companies are better on VDS: No. 3 Buick, No 5 GMC, No. 6 Chevrolet, No. 9 Ram, and No. 10 Lincoln.

If there’s a reason why US-flagged cars aren’t selling well in Europe, it may be that Ford and GM have cars specifically designed for international markets. Many US-designed cars are also built to be softer-riding and bigger inside and out to take account of our expanding waistlines, when Europeans want cars that make it through narrow streets. Americans are about 25 pounds heavier than in the 1960s.

Among BMW, Michelin (US HQ and factory nearby), and hundreds of suppliers, BMW and Michelin account for more than 75,000 jobs out of a South Carolina civilian workforce of just over 2 million.

If the President-elect wants to pick a fight with BMW in a state than went 55-41 for Trump, he may get push-back from Palmetto State residents and voters hoping nobody upsets the status quo.

He’s been arrested for bank fraud. There were previous reports of the FBI seizing hard drives from his house.

Looks like we could have a pretty big scandal brewing. The Paki was working for Schultz up until his arrest.

From Fox News:

A House IT staffer at the center of a congressional computer equipment scandal has been arrested by federal officials and charged with bank fraud, Fox News has learned.

Fox News is told officers and agents from the U.S. Capitol Police, the FBI and Customs and Border Protection were involved in the arrest of Imran Awan at Dulles International Airport.

Awan, 37, of Virginia, pleaded not guilty Tuesday to one count of bank fraud during his arraignment in federal court in Washington, D.C. He was released but will have to wear a GPS monitor and abide by a curfew.

Awan also was ordered to turn over all his passports. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Aug. 21.

Law enforcement authorities for months have been looking into how Awan may have double-billed the House for equipment like computers, iPads, monitors, keyboards and routers. Several relatives of Awan worked for House Democrats and were fired months ago. Awan, however, was kept on staff by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., even though he was no longer allowed access to the House server network.

Wasserman Schultz, though, has now fired Awan. Spokesman David Damron said Tuesday in a statement:

“Mr. Awan previously served as a part-time employee but his services have been terminated. No charges, evidence or findings from the investigation have been formally shared with our office, so we cannot comment on them.”

Authorities also have looked into IT workers putting sensitive House information on the “cloud” and potentially exposing it to outside sources.

It will be interesting to see if this Paki IT guy spills the beans on Debbie. Why else would Debbie hire some shady ass Paki IT guy unless she herself was running a criminal operation? We pretty much already know that the Democrat National Committee which she ran was involved in all sort of shady shit."

From CNBC:

Government investigators looking into how Google pays its employees have accused the tech giant of shortchanging women doing similar work to men.

A U.S. Department of Labor official disclosed the agency’s allegations during a Friday court hearing in San Francisco.

“We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce,” Janette Wipper, a Labor Department regional director, testified, according to a report published by The Guardian.

Google said it vehemently disagreed with the charges, which the Mountain View, California, company said it hadn’t heard until Wipper’s court appearance.

“Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap,” Google said in its statement.

If women were at home raising children as they should be, we wouldn’t be having any of these discussions. However, I’m not shedding any tears over Google being forced to deal with this. They actively promote all sorts of SJW and feminist propaganda through their business so they deserve it."

Former world No. 1 golfer Tiger Woods was arrested in South Florida early on Monday on a charge of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to an online Palm Beach County Police report.

Woods, who is second on the all-time list with 14 major titles, was booked at 7:18 a.m. (1118 GMT) and released several hours later on his own recognizance, the report showed.

Representatives for the 41-year-old American were not immediately available when asked by Reuters to comment.

Woods, who is currently sidelined from competition after having his fourth back surgery in April, said last week that he felt better than he had in years and had no plans to retire from competitive golf.

Why are people like Woods celebrated in our society? Is it because he’s a non-White who won golf tournaments? Seems like a silly reason to celebrate someone.

It looks like there were serious security violations on the House of Representatives network.

From Daily Caller:

FBI agents seized smashed computer hard drives from the home of Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s information technology (IT) administrator, according to two sources with knowledge of the investigation.

Pakistani-born Imran Awan, long-time right-hand IT aide to the former Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairwoman, has since desperately tried to get the hard drives back, an individual whom FBI investigators interviewed in the case told The Daily Caller News Foundation’s Investigative Group.

An additional source in Congress with direct knowledge of the case, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the probe, confirmed that the FBI has joined what Politico previously described as a Capitol Police criminal probe into “serious, potentially illegal, violations on the House IT network” by Imran and three of his relatives, who had access to the emails and files of the more than two dozen House Democrats who employed them on a part-time basis.

Capitol Police have also seized computer equipment tied to the Florida lawmaker.

We’ll have to see what comes of this.

What I’m hoping is that we’ll see lots of new investigations once Donald Trump finally gets his FBI Director in place. Sounds like this is one that should definitely be pursued further.

Of course there’s lots of other things that need to be pursued surrounding Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and the DNC server. It could even be argued that the entire Democrat party is a criminal enterprise and should be fully shut down."

From RT:

A group of former US intelligence officers are challenging the assessment that Russia hacked the Democrats during the 2016 presidential election. They are also criticizing analysts for not looking at the forensic evidence.

The Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) sent their first memo to President Donald Trump on Monday, challenging the claim that Russia “hacked” Democratic National Committee (DNC) computers during the 2016 presidential election.

The group focused on a new analysis from an individual known as the Forensicator, who uncovered evidence that the files stolen from the DNC by the hacker known as “Guccifer 2.0” were most likely leaked, not hacked.

The Forensicator analyzed metadata from the Guccifer 2.0 files, and showed that the files were transferred at a speed of 23 MB/s, making it “unlikely that this initial data transfer could have been done remotely over the Internet.” The Forensicator also found that the files were most likely copied to a USB drive by someone on the East Coast of the US, who had physical access to a computer connected to the DNC network.

Interesting that they came to the same conclusion that many of us have. The data most likely originated from someone inside the Democrat party itself.

Seth Rich the murdered DNC staffer is the most likely person who leaked it.

It is highly possible that he was killed in retaliation for providing the data to Wikileaks."

Guess this is because of the racist policies of Donald John Trump.

From Reuters:

The number of asylum seekers walking across the U.S. border into Canada rose in June after dropping in the previous two months, according to government figures released on Friday.

There were 884 refugee claimants who crossed the border between formal crossings and were picked up by Royal Canadian Mounted Police last month, bringing the total for the first half of 2017 to 4,345, the data showed.

The vast majority, 88 percent, of June’s crossers went to the province of Quebec, a marked contrast from previous months where upwards of 100 a month went to the prairie province of Manitoba.

Many asylum seekers whom Reuters has spoken to said they left the United States because they feared deportation in light of President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.

While not ideal, I can certainly live with this for now. Let Justin Trudeau pay for all these monkey hordes. He seems to think that Islam and faggotry are compatible. He is a common sense type of guy who will figure this shit out!

The Republican party has been unable to get an Obamacare repeal or an Obamacare replacement bill through Congress after seven months. This despite the fact that Obamacare is an unmitigated disaster and they campaigned on getting rid of it since 2010. You’d think this would be easy!

At least they took a step forward today. They passed a measure to debate Obamacare overhaul proposals. Vice President Mike Pence had to break the tie so the measure was approved 51 to 50.

From BBC:

The US Senate has voted to start debating a new Republican healthcare bill in a major step forward for President Donald Trump’s attempts to repeal his predecessor’s signature law.

In a tight vote, several Republicans previously opposed to aspects of the plan changed their minds.

Prior attempts to replace Obamacare have collapsed in recent weeks due to divisions in the Republican party.

President Trump had made scrapping the policy a key campaign pledge.

Before the vote took place, Mr Trump had warned his party’s senators of the repercussions of not pushing through the measures to repeal and replace Obamacare, known formally as the Affordable Care Act.

The Republican party, which needed a majority for the motion to go ahead, secured 51 votes after Vice-President Mike Pence cast a tie-breaker in support of the legislation.

There were also protesters claiming that the Senate was trying to kill them by repealing Obamacare.

Nobody really knows what the outcome of all this is going to be. A wide variety of proposals are going to be debated and voted on.

As someone who is healthy and not morbidly obese and out of shape like many Americans, the outcome of this doesn’t really impact me. I just want something passed so Donald Trump’s agenda can move forward. It doesn’t have to be a comprehensive solution, but just something that gets the ball rolling.

From a public relations standpoint, this has been horrible for the Republicans. They need to get something done to satisfy the base and then move on to other agenda items. Right now they have no major victories. I can see why Trump is mad. This situation is stupid."

There is no practical or logical reason for women to be in military service and especially in combat units. It is a completely retarded concept.

And who let this nigger have access to a dog? That’s animal abuse. No nigger should be allowed to have dogs or cats.

From Daily Mail:

A mother yesterday spoke of her anger that she only learned about her partner’s violent past after he beat her five-year-old son to death over a lost trainer.

Marvyn Iheanacho, 39, had a sickening history of violence, including six convictions for domestic abuse after he attacked five partners and a child.

Yet despite his appalling record, the burly thug with a terrifying temper was allowed to look after the boy after he embarked on a new relationship.

He started going out with single mother Lilya Breha, who was never told by police he had just been released from prison for assaulting his fifth girlfriend.

On a trip to the park on November 20 last year, the jobless father-of-three lost his temper when his new partner’s son, Alex Malcolm, lost a trainer.

Iheanacho battered the little boy with such savagery that witnesses who overheard eight ‘booming’ blows initially thought two grown men were fighting. They heard the child begging for mercy, sobbing, ‘I’m sorry, I’m sorry.’

Instead of taking the dying boy to hospital only a five-minute walk away, Iheanacho carried him through the street before taking a cab to Miss Breha’s home in Bromley, South-East London, where he attacked her, throttling her as she tried to call 999.

It looks like the kid may have been mixed race so I guess it wasn’t a total loss.

Hastert is currently serving jail time after he tried to bribe them into silence.

From AP:

An Illinois man accuses Dennis Hastert in a new lawsuit of sexually assaulting him in bathroom stall when he was a fourth-grader — at least the fifth such allegation against the former House speaker who will soon be released from prison in a hush-money case.

The suit was filed in a suburban Chicago court for a man using the pseudonym Richard Doe. It alleges Hastert abused him after the boy stopped during a bicycle ride to use the restroom in the 1970s in Yorkville, Ill., where Hastert was a high school wrestling coach, the Chicago Tribune reported.

The former Republican Illinois congressman, 75, has nearly completed a 15-month sentence for breaking banking law in trying to pay $3.5 million in hush money to one victim, referred to in filings in the criminal case as “Individual A.” Previous accusers had been in high school.

Hastert’s attorney didn’t immediately return messages from The Associated Press on Sunday seeking comment. A hearing in the case is set for Tuesday.

What’s disturbing about Hastert is that it illustrates how we have people who get into positions of power who can be easily blackmailed. This is a man who became one of the most powerful figures in Congress yet he was a faggot who fiddled with little boys.

Jews and donors will support people like Hastert because they know they’ll always do what they want. If they don’t, they can expose them and ruin them instantaneously.

I would bet that people like John McCain and Lindsey Graham also fit into this category. One can only imagine how many others there are but there’s probably quite a few."

I am fully supportive of his scorched earth tweet strategy that was rolled out this weekend.

One of the more interesting things that has come out of this has been several tweets criticizing Attorney General Jeff Sessions. I’m almost wondering if this whole thing has been staged. Sessions was one of Trump’s most loyal supporters from the start. Even though there might be legitimate friction between them over the Russia recusal situation, there might be an ulterior motive to these tweet storms.

Trump by attacking Sessions publicly is effectively taking any heat he would get if he were to open these investigations. You now have people in both political parties defending Sessions against the tweets of the wild man Trump. Sessions is now being viewed as a sympathetic figure.

This gives Sessions some space to open up investigations into the leaks, fire the current acting FBI director and even look into Hillary Clinton’s situation. The Jew media will run with a narrative saying that Sessions was forced to do these things because of the pressure Trump put on him.

It’s either that or Trump is legitimately angry at him, but if that were the case, I think he would have fired him by now. I think there is a very good chance Trump and Sessions are trolling the media with this and have used the Russia recusal to generate the narrative."

Four years into South Sudan’s devastating civil war, the world’s youngest nation is reeling from sexual violence on a “massive scale,” a new Amnesty International report says. Thousands of women, children and some men are suffering in silence, grappling with mental distress. Some now have HIV. Others were rendered impotent.

The report is based on interviews with 168 victims of sexual violence in South Sudan and in refugee camps in neighboring Uganda, home to the world’s fastest-growing refugee crisis.

That’s right Jews. Angela Merkel is readying gas chambers disguised as shower rooms. I’m 100 percent confident of this! lol

From DW:

Josef Schuster, the president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, says there are still parts of the country where it is considered dangerous to be Jewish.

“In some districts in major cities, I’d advise people not to identify themselves as Jews,” he said in an interview with the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. “Experience has shown that openly wearing a kippa or a necklace with the Star of David is enough to attract verbal or physical threats.”

Schuster said anti-Semitism was increasing in Germany and accused the government of failing to “take the necessary actions” to tackle the trend. One important step, he added, would be the appointment of a commissioner to record attacks and serve as a point of contact for people targeted by prejudice.

“The EU Parliament has recommended that all member states appoint such a representative … so it would be very strange if Germany didn’t appoint a commissioner to fight anti-Semitism,” he said.

But once again we see how these Jews are incapable of self-reflection. They don’t get that it is their behavior which makes them hated. Instead, they cry about how they are hated for no particular reason without admitting fault for anything.

The only reason hatred against them is increasing is because people are becoming more aware of their insane behavior. That includes Germans. I know for a fact that we have many Germans who visit this site and others like it. Even though much of Germany is totally cucked and falsely believe that their ancestors stuffed Jews in gas chambers, there is a small percentage of Germans who know the truth.

It is becoming increasingly obvious as to why Adolf Hitler sought to have the Jews removed from Europe. He was 100 percent correct to have done it. All you have to do is look at what Jews have been doing in Israel and everywhere else. The insane world we see today is a product of Judaism."

The new superbug began its spread in Englands gay community but is quickly reaching the furthest corners of the globe.

Houston is being hit particularly hard, and the bug is no longer only affecting only the gay community.

The bug prompted worldwide attention last year when it became immune to its most widely used cure. US health experts are calling their attempts at stopping the bug a limited success and fear it may soon be completely untreatable.

The bug has been found to cause infertility, along with all the alements associated with regular gonorrhoea.

It is currently being treated with a combination of azithromycin and ceftriaxone, but resistance to azithromycin is spreading, and experts say its only a matter of time before ceftriaxone fails too.

Experts estimate there are at least 16,000 infected individuals in the Houston metropolitan area, and the number is growing daily.

Doctors are recommending that all sexually active people in the Houston area should refresh themselves on practicing safe-sex to help curb the spread of the bug. Englands senior health expert says the bug is frighteningly close to becoming untreatable.

Dr Gwenda Hughes, the head of the sexually transmitted infections unit at Public Health England, said: We cannot afford to be complacent.

Jones, the artist behind all the past album artwork, confirmed with MTV News Sway, that they do in fact have an album coming out tentatively titled ΟΕΔΙΠΥΣ (Oedipus). The name is reference to a mythical Greek king of Thebes. During the interview, Jones jokes with Sway Ive [probably] said a bit too much. They also talk about how the launch of the new album will change Maynards current Puscifer tour schedule. Though he said that they havent gotten that far, he does believe that the tour for the new Tool album will probably coincide with the release that Jones said should see around October.

Recently Maynard said in an interview with Alternative Nation on April 20th, that he had no idea which of his bands he was recording his next album with next. No word if this was addressed with Jones in the interview.

Among details about the games features and setting, Rockstar confirmed rumors that it will be set in a fictional city named Magnolia City that is firmly based on Houston Texas.

The fictional name comes from one of Houstons very first nicknames. Starting in the 1870s, many locals referred to Houston by this name due to the vast magnolia forests, which have since been destroyed by urban sprawl.

Lead designer James Cummings revealed details about the vision of GTA 6 on his website:

We really wanted to push the envelope on the scale of GTA 6, and thats why we chose Houston. Houston is HUGE and very spread out. Our goal is to capture the true scale of Houston and its suburbs. This is going to be a big challenge for us, but weve never backed down from a challenge before. We WILL capture the essence and scale of Houston, from the skyscrapers to the shore.

No release date has been announced yet, but Cummings states it will be at least 6 months before more information is given about the project."

US health experts are expressing a huge concern for what they are calling super-gonorrhoea.

The new superbug began its spread in Englands gay community but is quickly reaching the furthest corners of the globe.

Houston is being hit particularly hard, and the bug is no longer only affecting only the gay community.

The bug prompted worldwide attention last year when it became immune to its most widely used cure. US health experts are calling their attempts at stopping the bug a limited success and fear it may soon be completely untreatable.

The bug has been found to cause infertility, along with all the alements associated with regular gonorrhoea.

It is currently being treated with a combination of azithromycin and ceftriaxone, but resistance to azithromycin is spreading, and experts say its only a matter of time before ceftriaxone fails too.

Experts estimate there are at least 16,000 infected individuals in the Houston metropolitan area, and the number is growing daily.

Doctors are recommending that all sexually active people in the Houston area should refresh themselves on practicing safe-sex to help curb the spread of the bug. Englands senior health expert says the bug is frighteningly close to becoming untreatable.

Dr Gwenda Hughes, the head of the sexually transmitted infections unit at Public Health England, said: We cannot afford to be complacent.

She is encouraging people to practise safe sex to minimise the risk of sexually transmitted infections."

Rumors had been circling after a video from one of Prince’s concerts in February 2011 surfaced showing the ‘Purple Rain’ singer telling Kourtni’s cousin, celebrity Kim Kardashian, to leave the stage.

Kim initially played it off tweeting that she was “nervous” and “froze” after being touched by the pop legend, but close friends and snapchat followers tell the Associated Press that she never let the moment go and often brings it up in random conversation like a betrayed lover speaks of his or her ex.

Source

According to the Los Angeles Times, Kourtni had a warrant issued for her arrest on Saturday, but she has yet to turn herself in. Police were tipped off after an anonymous call cited a speeding ticket she had received, coincidentally, the day of Prince’s death, in the area near his Minnesota residence. Arakelian has a string of problematic behavior dating back to exactly 5 years to the day that the incident happened between her famous cousin and the famous singer and pancake chef.

Source

In February of 2006, the Kardashian cousin was popped for “unsafe speed for prevailing conditions” on the road in Orange County. She was charged again with unsafe speed on October 12, 2010 and once again, with exactly the same infraction in February 2012.

Arakelian, known by Facebook friends as “Cetty Wap” because she sells “[explicit deleted]” amounts of percs”, is believed to possibly also be the enabler behind Prince’s overdose a week prior. “Percs” also known as Percocets, are pain killers that Prince allegedly turned to to fight his chronic hip pain he suffered for years. His friends begged him to get the surgery, but he declined due to his devout Jehovah’s Witness faith.

If this is true, it will be interesting to see if any evidence surfaces tying Kim to a murder for hire scheme that could rip the famous family apart."

Compare the UK and US versions of Kitchen Nightmares. In the UK version they can be 3 days in after 10 minutes. In the US version there can be 10 minutes left, and they still haven’t tasted the food. Ramsay is also decidedly more helpful and less angry in the British version too.

“We were just leaving the city limits of Prescott, Arizona when the damn car overheated or something so I pulled it over to the side of the road and within just a minute or two there were a couple of cars that pulled over to help me out. I told them that I was on the phone with the rental car company but one of them had a brother who owned a tow truck and a few minutes later it was there and he towed it to a place nearby to get fixed.

So then the one guy finds out that I’m not from there and offers to take me in to get lunch while my car is getting fixed and I’m thinking, ‘Sure, what the hell.’ So we drove to the finest dining spot in Prescott – some place on Gurly Street, I think – and got a burger. Great freakin’ burger too. These guys had no idea who I was either which made my day, honestly.

I’m telling you, these people in Prescott are the real deal. I’m going to move there after I retire,” Aniston said with a laugh.

Aniston added later, “You have to understand, this is something that would’ve never happened in L.A.! So yeah, that’s my story about Prescott, Arizona. It’s nice to know there are still places like this in America.”

In the newly released interview, Carrey said:

“I know it sounds kind of crazy but it’s something that I’ve been thinking about for a long time. I’ve visited Portland, Texas a few times over the years and the people there have always seemed like the most genuine and sincere people I think I’ve ever met and most of them had no idea who I was which is kind of a great thing sometimes, to be honest. No place is perfect but Portland just feels like home to me and I’m looking forward to small town life.

I want to be able to walk into a restaurant and know half the people there. I want to do all of my shopping at one place, like at Walmart. Maybe I’ll get some land and raise a few goats or chickens. I might even run for mayor,” Carrey said, laughing.

Real estate brokers in the area were understandably excited about the news that the wealthy Hollywood actor was moving to their area and some unconfirmed reports are claiming that he already has a home picked out. Check in with us again at local31news.com for more on this breaking story out of Portland, Texas. We’ll update this news article as more information becomes available.

Great freakin’ pizza too. These guys had no idea who I was either which made my day, honestly.

I’m telling you, these people in Mesquite are the real deal. I’m going to move there after I retire,” Damon said with a laugh.

Damon added later, “You have to understand, this is something that would’ve never happened in L.A.! So yeah, that’s my story about Mesquite, Nevada. It’s nice to know there are still places like this in America.”

99,http://local31news.com/featured/shark-breaches-diving-cage-with-diver-inside/,local31news,Shark Breaches Diving Cage with Diver Inside,[],"Pretty lame to see these sharks are baited so close to giant steel cages considering their knowledge of how they are blinded when lunging. There are a lot of videos where sharks breach cages and there really shouldn’t be. It’s not fair to the diver or the shark. Either make a cage that can withstand 3 sharks rattling it simultaneously, or don’t make it at all. It literally has one job.

However, the cage doesn’t really need to stop sharks, it would be expensive and heavy to make a cage that could. It needs to not be food and be annoying to get through. Great Whites aren’t after people, they aren’t going to try to get into the cage to attack people. They want tuna. I’ve only heard of one other shark breaking into a cage before in a similar incident, but I have seen many sharks approach cages inspect them (aka gnaw on them a bit) and there were no problems.

100,http://lastdeplorables.com/obama-caught-sneaking-back-u-s-alaska/,lastdeplorables,Obama Was Caught Sneaking Back Into The U.S. Through Alaska,['Robert Amnor'],"Barak Obama was seen sneaking back into the U.S. through Alaska, and he is determined to get to Washington, for a secret meeting that we just found out about it. Reports confirmed that Eric Holder, the former Attorney General, wants Obama at this secret meeting, and it’s regarding Trump. Anyhow, Trump has discovered their evil plan, and it’s disturbing how far they wanted to go to destroy our loved president.

Obama was caught by a woman who saw him in Alaska and took a photo of him and her baby, that went viral. Trump camp saw this photo and notified that Obama was coming back.

CBS News shared this tweet with Obama and the Alaska baby, and as expected, the mainstream media made Obama look like a superhero:

""Oh my God, it is Obama:"" An Alaska mom and her baby get the surprise of a lifetime while walking through an airport https://t.co/QFbAdAe8Fu pic.twitter.com/qYSdmms0nW — CBS News (@CBSNews) July 8, 2017

“Obama will headline the fundraiser for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee (NDRC) at a private home in Washington that will also be attended by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and will be hosted by former Attorney General Eric Holder,” CNN reported Monday.

Normally, private events are not the press main interest, but Obama was left with no choice after the Trump camp revealed the secret event as the reason Barack was back.

After investigating, it turns out that this secret meeting is the start of the former Obama administration’s plan to defeat Trump in 2020. Obama has admitted that The National Democratic Redistricting Committee (NDRC) is his main interest, his priority.

“Where he will be most politically engaged will be at the state legislative level, with an eye on redistricting after 2020,” White House political director David Simas stated for Politico, in October 2016.

NDRC is important to Obama and other big names in the Democratic Party because that is how they will change the determination of the districts called “gerrymandering.”

This is their plan, to manipulate the borders of the districts so they can make it in their favor, to turn a state from red to blue.

California is one example of this, as the state is mostly red but they manipulated the main urban areas in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and Democrats have owned it in elections ever since.

“Restoring fairness to our democracy by advocating for fairer, more inclusive district maps around the country is a priority for [now-former] President Obama,” stated Kevin Lewis, a spokesman for the former president.

As CNN reported, the event “marks Obama’s first foray back into politics since departing the White House on January 20.” So, Obama says his priority is to make sure we have “fair” district lines -like we can’t see through his lies.

Luckily his cover was blown and now we know to keep an eye on him.

Luckily, our military is not prepared to appease any Muslim demands.

A Muslim student, who is about to attend a historic military academy in South Carolina, is attempting to force the school to allow her to wear a hijab. The school refused her request and told her she is not above the rules.

The military college, the Citadel, has a long history and has operated as a school for 175 years. It has not allowed an exception to the dress code once in its entire history.

Now, an entitled Muslim student is demanding the school break tradition and guidelines to support her religion and protect her feelings.

The Citadel’s dress code is strict. Students are required to be in uniform at all times while on campus, with only two exceptions. They may wear bathing suits while swimming, and be out of uniform during a furlough, which only upper-year students enjoy.

The academy’s president announced the decision earlier this week explaining that, “The standardization of cadets in apparel, overall appearance, actions, and privileges is essential to the learning goals and objectives of the college.”

“This process reflects an initial relinquishing of self, during which cadets learn the value of teamwork to function as a single unit,” the president said, justifying the almost two-century long guideline.

The Citadel allows for religious accommodation so long as it does not undermine the objectives of the school such as morale, health and safety, or good order. Breaking unit cohesion for a head scarf is not acceptable.

The Muslim student is not accepting the school’s decision in good spirit. Instead, she is suing the school with the support of the terror-funded Council of American-Islamic Relations. She says the lawsuit will go through unless the school allows her to attend in a hijab.

The Muslim-led attack on our historic institutions is being launched in an attempt to undermine our history. Muslims have convinced short-sided liberals to abandon their principles in the name of protecting the supposedly oppressed.

The Muslims are not fighting for equality, as the school policy treats people of all faiths equally. Instead, they demand special privileges for only themselves. This is a part of the process known as creeping Sharia, where Muslims are able to trick a country into adopting Sharia law one principle at a time.

The school informed the student that they are happy to have her attend if she arrives bareheaded, which is more than fair. Our military doesn’t make exceptions for ANYONE, and that’s one of the reasons it’s the best in the world!

Do you agree with the school in blocking the Muslim’s demand? Please share the story on Facebook and tell us what you think because we want to hear YOUR voice!"

On several occasions, Obama’s forgotten that he isn’t president anymore, as evidenced several weeks ago where he went behind President Trump’s back urging senators not to scrap Obamacare. Now Obama is trying again to make a power move on Trump and take over as president, after holding a secret diplomatic meeting with a foreign leader. But this time, Obama’s antics aren’t just annoying, they’re highly illegal. And unfortunately for Obama, his cocky behavior and disregard for our nation’s laws could land him time behind bars in federal prison.

The Daily Caller reports that Obama met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in Monday, where “dealing with Trump” was discussed between the two men for over 40 minutes. Blinded by his massive over-inflated ego while pretending to be someone important, Obama apparently missed the fact that holding a diplomatic foreign meeting as a civilian is a direct violation of the Logan Act and a serious federal crime. According to the Logan Act, any citizen of the United States who tries to shape America’s foreign policy without authorization by the government is breaking federal law, a serious offense that is borderline treason! Here’s the exact wording of the Logan Act:

Any citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.

But trying subvert of the President of the United States and illegally influencing American foreign policy was just part of Obama’s agenda that day, as he then used his time with the South Korean president to undermine President Trump, blasting his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate change accord.

“In Paris, we came together around the most ambitious agreement in history about climate change, an agreement that even with the temporary absence of American leadership can still give our children a fighting chance,” Obama said in Indonesia. The Daily Caller reported:

Former President Barack Obama seems to be feeling nostalgic for his old job, meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in Monday for 40 minutes.

The Korea Herald reported that Moon spoke about his recent meetings with President Trump in Washington and asked Obama for his advice on how to improve that relationship.

The meeting came after Obama spoke at the Asian Leadership Conference and the Fourth Congress of Indonesian Diaspora in Jakarta. There he attacked Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate change accord.

“In Paris, we came together around the most ambitious agreement in history about climate change, an agreement that even with the temporary absence of American leadership can still give our children a fighting chance,” Obama said in Indonesia.

The former president had said before leaving office that he appreciated his predecessor George W. Bush’s silence during his tenure, but also contended that he’s “still a citizen and that carries with it duties and obligations.”

This citizen status has led to him to have an active post-presidential political life.

He appealed to members of Congress in May to have the “courage” to save Obamacare, and just a few weeks into President Trump’s tenure Obama put out a statement through his spokesman attacking Trump’s so-called “travel ban.”

President Trump and Obama have had a strained relationship. Trump has accused Obama of both spyings on him and obstruction of justice.

It’s high freaking time that Obama is taken down a few notches and reminded that he is no longer President of the United States. While this idiot might have gotten away with trampling all over our Constitution by hiding behind his position as Commander-in-Chief surrounded by all his cronies, now that he’s a civilian, there’s no reason in the world that the Trump Administration should let this type of subversion and borderline treason continue. Hopefully, someone in Washington will finally hold Obama’s feet to the fire, and throw his ass in prison for breaking the federal law!"
104,http://lastdeplorables.com/don-lemon-walks-off-cnn-set-guest-calls-fake-news/,lastdeplorables,Don Lemon Walks Off CNN Set After Guest Calls Him Out for Fake News!,['Robert Amnor'],"CNN is getting crushed in the ratings for reporting ‘fake’ news and they are now doing worse than ‘Nick-at-Nite’.

Now, Don Lemon of CNN walks off the set after a Republican guest calls him the fake news. The topic was the cost of protecting the First Family, a tiny fraction of the U.S. budget that EVERY president has.

This is priceless. Don Lemon cannot handle the heat.

Watch:

Don Lemon: “Paris, what do you think?”

Paris Dennard: “I think this is fake news. This is not…this is not a news story.”

Don Lemon: “What about it is fake, Paris? Are we going down this road again?”

Paris Dennard: “Yeah we are! The President is not breaking any laws.”

Don Lemon: “…Please stop with that stupid talking point that this is a fake news story!…”

Paris Dennard: ” Don, this is a fake news story in my opinion….”

At this point, Don Lemon couldn’t take the heat anymore, cut off his guest and walked away!

Don Lemon: “Ok, thank you very much, everyone. Thanks for watching. Have a great weekend. Good night all.”

This is just another example of CNN falling apart for being caught. As I mentioned, CNN has made a drastic drop in the rating war. While FOX and MSNBC hold the number 1 and 2 positions, CNN has dropped to number 13.

Last week, more Americans tuned in to watch re-runs of “Yogi Bear,” “Full House,” and “Friends” on ‘Nick-At-Nite’ than watching Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon’s shows on CNN.

CNN fell behind HGTV, Nick-At-Nite, History Channel, and ESPN, the sports network that’s been hemorrhaging viewers for months.

When will CNN begin to tell the truth? It does not seem that they plan to change direction. Jeff Zucker, the president of CNN just makes excuses. Hosts like Don Lemon seem to be in denial.

Last week, President Trump tweeted out a GIF of himself appearing to pummel a wrestler with CNN’s logo superimposed over the latter’s face. The network has covered the tweet nearly nonstop ever since.

Not only that, CNN went after the Redditor who made the GIF and threatened to out him unless he apologized and promised to never say anything CNN dislikes again. The move drew much criticism and may have been illegal.

On July 4, CNN published a fake quote from Abraham Lincoln. In the same Twitter thread, CNN also misattributed a quote to Benjamin Franklin that actually came from British writers John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon, authors of Cato’s Letters.

On Thursday morning, the network falsely claimed German Prime Minister Angela Merkel had chosen the location of the G20 summit to sabotage Trump.

It never ends.

They have been caught on tape admitting that they played the Russia story, knowing it was fake, just for ratings.

Journalism is supposed to be a public service; its purpose is to inform people of the changing world around them. As the American Press Institute states, “the foremost value of news is a utility to empower the informed.”

CNN has left that model and has become an extension of the DNC. It is a very sad moment for the history of the free press in the United States.

William Randolph Hearts and Joseph Pulitzer may have been sneaky and mean, but even they would be ashamed of CNN.

Sad."

Political correctness is quickly going by the wayside in the name of self preservation.

After taking a couple of cheap shots from a Muslim thug, a bus driver had a bit of a rude awakening for one of Allah’s little soldiers… ning for one of Allah’s little soldiers… people actually fight back when you come after them!

Muslim migrants don’t want anything to do with the countries customs or laws, and think they are above them and the people of the country.

That’s why this man just thought he could slap the driver into submission, because he believes himself to be superior. But as these thugs are finding out more and more, people have had enough and many of them are more than capable of handling themselves when provoked by these violent refugees.

I have said for months that this would eventually be the outcome from people around the world as these refugees become more brazen.

They’ve made our countries dangerous, and its about time we stood up for ourselves. Their ‘god’ does not give them the right to attack other people, in Europe or in America. They can go back to their own country and do that to their own people, where it seems to be the norm.

Not only are the migrants and illegals against the American people, but the liberals are as well. When we are attacked by those who don’t belong in this country, we have to face the wrath of the liberals, who give all of their sympathy and understanding to the attackers who instigated the conflict.

Enough is enough. The liberals need to stop cooing and crying over the refugees who have no remorse for the attacks that they commit on countries around the world, they need to stop protesting the ban President Trump set onto refugees from certain countries.

People from those countries want to do more than punch us in our faces, they want to shoot us, stab us, bomb us, and run us over with cars. They want to breed us out so they can take control of the world and run it as an Islamic State.

That’s why we don’t want them in our country. It’s not about racism, it’s about protecting both OUR country and OUR citizens.

106,http://lastdeplorables.com/breaking-look-just-shot-sky-alaska-north-korea/,lastdeplorables,BREAKING: Look What Was Just Shot Out Of The Sky Above Alaska – It’s OVER For North Korea,['Robert Amnor'],"The days of tip-toeing around terrorists and dictators is long since over now that we have a new Commander-in-Chief in the White House who doesn’t make apologies for America’s actions. It seems that some didn’t take him seriously despite the warnings he sent and threats of retaliation should other leaders provocate war. President Donald Trump has been nothing but blunt and stern with little tyrant Kim Jong-un whose mental illness seems to have gotten the best of him.

The U.S. has been doing this dance with North Korea of their nuclear capabilities for far too long and Kim Jong doesn’t seem to want to back down. After proving that both Russia and North Korea could successfully hit Alaska by using an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the concern of a world war became all too real. In response, America’s Pacific commander Adm. Harry Harris Jr. said “if it flies, it will die,” and he meant it.

Business Insider reported back in April that before “an extraordinary White House briefing for senators, close ally South Korea started installing key parts of a contentious U.S. defense system against missiles from North Korea.” Harris was clear in his warning at that time that “any North Korean missile fired at U.S. forces would be destroyed,” the report added.

“South Korea’s trumpeting of progress in setting up the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, comes as high-powered U.S. military vessels converge on the Korean Peninsula and as a combative North Korea signals possible nuclear and missile testing. Harris said the THAAD would be operational within days,” according to Business Insider. Today, THAAD is alive and well and we’re seeing that with what they did for the first time in Alaska.

North Korea has pushed Trump and America too far and have now just been issued our most assertive message to them yet. They thought they had us with being able to strike Alaska but forgot that the U.S. has the most powerful military in the world. This was proven by successfully shooting down the first intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) over Alaska today.

RT reports:

“The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system has successfully shot down a target over Alaska, in the system’s first intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) intercept, according to the US Missile Defense Agency (MDA).”

“THAAD managed to shoot down the IRBM target launched from the Pacific Spaceport Complex in Kodiak, Alaska, on Tuesday, the MDA said in a statement cited by Reuters.”

“’The successful demonstration of THAAD against an IRBM-range missile threat bolsters the country’s defensive capability against developing missile threats in North Korea and other countries around the globe and contributes to the broader strategic deterrence architecture’, the MDA said in the statement.”

Direct hit! See how our #THAAD system intercepted a missile target in major U.S. test: https://t.co/8AZ1DpjsBB pic.twitter.com/9a147sdHVy — Lockheed Martin (@LockheedMartin) July 11, 2017

Fear is growing around the world that rogue countries like North Korea will attempt a nuclear strike against America or its allies and now we’re proving that we’re prepared to win. On the 4th of July, North Korea test-fired what nobody knew they had – an inter-continental ballistic missile or ICBM, which is the type of missile could be used by them or Russia in an air strike against America.

However, as North Korea and others rattle their sabres, President Trump and Secretary of Defense General “Mad Dog” Mattis are unfazed but also proactive. The USS Carl Vinson and it’s fleet, which is our most formidable naval battle group, were deployed to the Korean Peninsula earlier the year. This nuclear carrier can do it all, including knocking down whatever North Korea can shoot up.

U.S. forces testing the THAAD system this morning in Alaska is another, more assertive, effort to double-down on the safety and security of Americans and our allies which our president and his administration have as a top priority. Lockheed Martin developed this system years ago to shut down the ability of rogue nations to launch a nuclear strike against America and today’s successful interception proves how vital it is to our security. The THAAD defense system is like no other in the world, so as Kim Jong-Un continues to talk about destroying America, all it will ever amount to is his puffed up ego and tough-talking. Our defense systems consistently improve, while North Korea can’t even afford to run electricity for their people at night."
107,http://lastdeplorables.com/guilty-guess-got-caught-smuggling-muslims-united-states/,lastdeplorables,Guilty! Guess Who Got Caught Smuggling Muslims Into The United States?,['Robert Amnor'],"There is already more than ample evidence to support locking-down the border with Mexico and only allowing carefully vetted persons entry. That said, we just got more reason to do so.

Our nation has laws governing who enters this country in order to protect our citizens. This should be obvious. If it isn’t, then the recent apprehension of a smuggler should settle the case once and for all.

When you think of smuggling and Mexico, drugs immediately come to mind. And well they should. But there’s another kind of smuggling going on, and it is at least as dangerous, if not more so. It involves the smuggling of potential terrorists into our country, and somebody just got caught.

Here is proof that President Trump is absolutely correct about the need to close the southern border. “Sharafat Ali Khan, 32, pleaded guilty in a D.C. federal court Wednesday to one count of conspiracy to smuggle undocumented migrants into the U.S. for profit. The Washington Times reported that he will be sentenced this summer and could get up to 46 months in prison, though a lesser sentence is likely.”

What do we know about those he has been smuggling into our country? “Court documents revealed the complexity of Kahn’s operation, which included moving illegal immigrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Peru and other countries through Brazil to Central America and eventually to Mexico before they would cross the U.S. southern border, Breitbart reported. For some, the journey took as long as nine months.”

This is precisely what we have been warning about. It’s not enough to ban travel from nations that are infested with terrorists. These people are not stupid. They will just find another route if one is available, in this case via South and Central American countries then through Mexico.

Fortunately, one smuggler of potential terrorists has been put out of business. And he had the gall to express the hope that after his time in prison, that he might be able to remain in the U.S., as though serving a prison term was a meritorious act that somehow qualified him for citizenship, or at least permission to remain as an alien.

District Judge Walton was not about to put up with that. “‘That’s not part of the agreement,’ Walton said, having Khan sign paperwork promising to assist in his own deportation once his sentence is completed.”

The justice system in this country will work just fine provided the proper leadership is in place. The appointment of Attorney General Sessions was a great start. Firing Obama appointed officials was another great move. If we get control of the borders as President Trump has promised, we’ve got a real reason for hope, especially after eight years of Obama policies that put our nation in danger."
108,http://lastdeplorables.com/facebook-destroys-massive-pro-trump-group-deplorables-attack/,lastdeplorables,Facebook Destroys Massive Pro-Trump Group; Deplorables Under Attack,['Robert Amnor'],"Facebook is refusing to help one of the largest and most influential pro-President Trump Facebook groups as it suffers a massive coordinated attack by left-wingers trying to shut it down.

“The Deplorables” is the brainchild of Tom Lipscomb, the conservative founder of the New York Times’ Times Books imprint. Moderators include famous Islam critic Pam Geller, Baltimore black conservative radio host Wayne Dupree, tea party leader Lori Saxon, and this reporter. Founded on September 9, the day after Hillary Clinton’s infamous “basket of deplorables” remark, the group shot to prominence in the last weeks of the election and now has more than 515,000 members. But all of that success is about to be undone.

Early Saturday morning, group administrator Dan Schwartz pinned an announcement on the Deplorables page that reads: “DO NOT POST, AS YOUR POST WILL NEVER BE SEEN.”

Schwartz explained: “The Deplorables group was essentially broken by Facebook now, for a variety of reasons. Essentially, we enabled post moderation because of the number of racist posts from trolls, who, even when we deleted the post and “member,” we could no longer block them, including several who we now know are Facebook Employees &/or Contractors. When we enabled post moderation, Facebook’s database crashed, and we cannot view your posts requiring Moderator approval; and worse, the Admin panel crashed, so we cannot even turn back off Moderation.

Essentially, FACEBOOK BROKE OUR GROUP.

We have had numerous technical “problems” since we topped a half-million Deplorables around Election Day; and they have grown only worse in the last 36 hours. We have REPEATEDLY made Facebook staff aware of the problems; but it appears since we “Deplorables” do not comport with Silicon Valley’s vision of America.”

Big League Politics has reached out to Facebook regarding Schwartz’s allegations — including his unconfirmed claim that people on the Facebook payroll have been trying to sabotage the group. We will update this report when Facebook replies.

So what happened? Why were left-wing trolls allowed to attack the group and why did the wave of attacks all happen so suddenly?

“We have the liberals and in fact there are secret groups that try to infiltrate the group using fake accounts,” Schwartz told Big League Politics.

“The trolling is a real problem. They’ll pretend to be a Trump supporter and then post something racist or homophobic,” Schwartz said. “What I do is a couple times a day I do a search for (awful words) or sometimes comments in there, but there’s an inability to block people. You unload somebody and then next thing you know they’re back in. If they don’t help me clean it up” then the group is dead. Schwartz said that his “Block User” function has been broken for months even after he reported the problem to Facebook management.

Facebook has not been willing to provide Schwartz the tools he needs to moderate the troll attacks.

“I was invited to the Facebook summit but” couldn’t make it, Schwartz said, referring to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s recent conference in Chicago focusing on Facebook Communities. “I had been in touch with their team beginning in May. We’ve gotten some basic moderating tools but it’s very limited. We need more advanced tools for groups over 50,000 to 100,000 in size. We tried moderating posts, but it just got out of control.” Schwartz noted a backlog of about 50,000 posts that moderators previously had been unable to keep up with.

Schwartz said that he is the personal victim of attacks by left-wing trolls, and also of censorship by Facebook authorities.

“I’ve been targeted because I run such a big group,” Schwartz said. “Everybody has been targeted with spear-phishing attempts, because anyone who can get into my account can shut the group down. I’m constantly getting spear-phishing attacks.”

Schwartz also recently had his personal Facebook account heavily restricted for 30 days (making group management more difficult) for posting a cartoon depicting Muslim men trying to rape a woman while the girl’s father is led away by authorities calling him a “bigot.” Facebook flagged the cartoon for “nudity,” but, having seen the cartoon, the “nudity” case is a stretch. We have decided not to print the cartoon here at this time, to prevent Facebook from being able to stifle the wide dissemination of this article.

Facebook’s conduct in this matter is part of a continuing pattern. Big League Politics recently reported that another major pro-Trump group with 132,000 members was deleted by Facebook with no explanation. After our report and widespread Deplorable outrage, Facebook backed down after seven days and re-instated the group.

“A lot of what we can do is to help create a more civil and productive debate on some of the bigger issues as well,” Zuckerberg told CNN at his Communities Summit in Chicago, indicating that he plans to focus on censoring political content (like he is trying to do in China to get the government to un-block Facebook there). But why does he allow left-wing troll attacks to bring pro-Trump groups to their knees?

Failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton urged social media platforms to “hurry up” and moderate the kind of content that she thinks helped Trump defeat her in the election.

“The other side was using content that was just flat-out false and delivering it in a very personalized way,” Clinton said at the California-based Code Conference. “If I put myself in the position of running a platform like Facebook, first of all, they’ve got to get back to trying to curate it more effectively,” she said. “Put me out of the equation, they’ve got to help prevent fake news from creating a new reality that does influence how people think of themselves, see the world, the decisions that they make.”

Replying to Clinton’s comment, Schwartz told BLP, “We pleaded with Facebook to deploy admin tools beyond the crude ones they provide, so we could indeed block Macedonian #FakeNews websites, so we could clean up the mess Facebook helped create in our gigantic group; but we were repeatedly ignored. What’s more, I also admin a couple small groups, and the “ask member a question” tool used to screen people who want to join was available over a month ago, while it was just available to us a couple days ago.”

Actually one more page on facebook is hit with something weird this is us : The Deplorables

One of our members informed us about this in our inbox.

What is facebook trying to do? Shutdown all groups pages that are named The Deplorables?

Facebook shareholders recently pressured Zuckeberg to cut down against “Fake News” while taking a jab at President Trump.

Arjuna Capital executive Natasha Lamb defined fake news as “content posed and disseminated with the intent to mislead, not the mainstream media which the [US] President refers to as fake news.” The supposed epidemic “needs to be managed systemically,” Lamb argued, saying that, “A lack of self regulation could incite government regulation.”

Zuckerberg vowed that Facebook has a “special focus on trying to reduce the prevalence of false news in the system.”

Zuckerberg is generating murmurs as a possible presidential candidate against Trump in 2020. Zuckerberg downplayed presidential speculation after his recent very public road trip across America, saying he was merely “doing it to get a broader perspective to make sure we’re best serving our community of almost 2 billion people at Facebook and doing the best work to promote equal opportunity at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.”

The Facebook founder’s Chan Zuckerberg Initiative recently hired Obama campaign veteran David Plouffe and George W. Bush campaign manager Ken Mehlman."

Even though Democrats are trying to bring him down, the true Americans recognize his real power and respect.

President Donald Trump during the presidential campaign made few major promises, and he is prepared to keep all of them. He has found out the perfect solution for the biggest problems in our country, but sadly the Democrats were here to block it. Trump cannot make a decision without being attacked and criticized by them.

Hollywood celebrities are motivating these attacks. They are mocking the President publicly and even provoking violence. And Snoop Dog and Kathy Griffin have done the worst acts of promoting violence. He released a video in which he shoots a clown that looks like President Trump, and she posed with the bloody head of the President.

So now what will the Democrats say about the President’s attempt to save Charlie Gard. NHC left the UK baby to die, and the hospital didn’t approve his transfer to the United States. This was a shocking scandal, and President Trump offered to help.

“If we can help little #CharlieGard, as per our friends in the UK and the Pope, we would be delighted to do so,” President Trump wrote on Twitter.

Charlie Gard is a 10-month-old baby, and the UK court thinks that the life support machine should be turned off.

But a man standing behind the soldier wasn’t having any of it, and by the time he finished, the entire store was cheering. A man named Hunter Green recounted the outstanding story on his Facebook wall, telling about how his son had gone to California and encountered many different people, most of whom thanked him for his service and fighting to protect not only our freedoms, but the freedom of others as well. But one incident at a grocery store, as he headed back to base, stuck in his mind. That’s when a Muslim woman dressed in a burka had some not nice things to say about our country and the flag that represents it. (H/T at Mad World News) Here is his Facebook post!

Hunter Green:

One of my sons serves in the military. He is still

stateside, here in California. He called me yesterday to let me know how

warm and welcoming people were to him and his troops everywhere he goes,

telling me how people

shake their hands and thank them for being willing to

serve and fight for not only our own freedoms, but so that others may

have them also.

But he also told me about an incident in the grocery store

he stopped at yesterday on his way home from the base. He said that ahead

of several people in front of him stood a woman dressed in a burkha.

He said when she got to the cashier she loudly remarked

about the U.S. flag lapel pin the cashier wore on her smock. The

cashier reached up and touched the pin, and said proudly, “Yes, I always

wear it and probably always will.”

The woman in the burkha then asked the cashier when she was

going to stop bombing her countrymen, explaining that she was Iraqi.

A gentleman standing behind my son stepped forward.

Putting his arm around my son’s shoulders and nodding

towards my son, he said in a calm and gentle voice to the Iraqi woman:

“Lady, hundreds of thousands of men and women like this young man have

fought and died so that YOU could stand here, in MY country and accuse a

check-out cashier of bombing YOUR countrymen. It is my belief that had you

been this outspoken in YOUR own country, we wouldn’t need to be there today.

But, hey, if you have now learned how to speak out so loudly and clearly,

I’ll gladly buy you a ticket and pay your way back to Iraq so you can

straighten out the mess in YOUR country that you are obviously here in MY

country to avoid.”

Everyone within hearing distance cheered!

IF YOU AGREE.. Pass this on to all your proud American

friends.

Now that was awesome! Unfortunately, these people come to our country and they don’t even like it here. They want to change our country into the hellhole they came here from. It makes no sense."
112,http://lastdeplorables.com/muslims-wanted-texas-mayor-fired-banned-sharia-courts-check-epic-response/,lastdeplorables,Muslims Wanted This Texas Mayor FIRED After She BANNED Sharia Courts… Check Out Her EPIC Response,['Robert Amnor'],"Why are Muslims so hell bent on establishing Sharia Law wherever they go?

Let’s do a little comparison. This is a country run by Sharia Law:

And this is a country run by the rule of Law… Democracy… and Christians:

However, many Muslims are STILL trying to push this archaic form of “law.” It’s bad enough in their own countries…but when they try to establish it here? Fuhgettaboutit. This country is about government run by and for the People. Sharia Law is about pushing the selfish desires of Imams and warlords.

So when a group of Muslims tried to establish Sharia Law in Texas AGAIN… well Irving Texas Mayor Beth Van Duyne gave them a piece of her mind. Check it out:

From Conservative Tribune:

The group of Muslims who attempted to establish the first Islamic Sharia court inside the United States in the town of Irving, Texas just received a devastating blow thanks to the town’s mayor standing strong and not backing down. Mayor Beth Van Duyne made a public Facebook post stating that she backs the new Texas law which prohibits any kind of foreign law from being practiced in the state of Texas. After calls, threats and toddler-like demands to apologize from the Muslims who attempted to form the Sharia tribunal along with representatives from the Council on Islamic-American Relations, a known front for the Muslim Brotherhood, the mayor never once backed down.

According to yes I’m right:

Of course, Sharia Law doesn’t align with U.S. law because U.S. law is based in the real world with hundreds of years of precedence, trials, and laws that helped shape the codes of conduct of this great nation. Sharia Law is based on religious ideologies that include beheadings and burning people alive. Let’s be real – Which one sounds more reasonable here?"
113,http://lastdeplorables.com/air-force-officer-witnessed-attack-seals-killed-bin-laden-just-said-lied-obama-hell-pay/,lastdeplorables,Air Force Officer Who Witnessed Attack on SEALS WHO KILLED BIN LADEN Just Said WE HAVE ALL BEEN LIED TO – OBAMA Has HELL TO PAY,['Robert Amnor'],"A highly decorated Air Force officer is breaking her silence about the disturbing incident that occurred back in 2011 that marked the deadliest attack on Navy SEALS in U.S. history. She claims that Obama’s administration covered up what happened to 38 of our warriors in Afghanistan, when a Chinook helicopter crashed and killed 38 fighters. She says had it not been for Obama changing the rules of engagement of our military to protect Muslim terrorists, that our men would still be alive today.

To give you a full appreciation for the absolute atrocity and borderline treason that went down that fateful day on August 6, 2011 at the hands of Barack Hussein Obama, Retired Air Force Capt. Joni Marquez is telling her story first hand. She and her crew were working the dark morning hours on their AC-130 gunship when they were summoned to conduct a mission she describes “as almost like a 9-1-1 type of a situation.”

Circa reported:

The gunship was ordered to fly close-in air support above Afghanistan’s dangerous Tangi Valley, in Wardak Province, assisting troops with the Army’s 75th Ranger Regiment who were being fired on by eight heavily armed Taliban insurgents.

The Rangers had called in for assault helicopters to engage the enemy hiding among the rocky valley. The air weapons team fired on the Taliban fighters, but not all of the insurgents were killed as originally believed.

In her first interview since the incident, Marquez recounts what she witnessed that night as she was the fire control officer aboard the ship. Her job that night was to ensure the sensors on the weapons were aligned, so that the her crew could hone in on the terrorists’ targets:

“I had the sensor operators immediately shift to the eight insurgents the helicopters had taken out,” Marquez told Circa. “Two were still alive.”

But what should’ve been a routine mission to take out the terrorists never happened because Obama’s generals would not give the gunship permission to fire. She relayed the scene to the ground force commander, but was denied permission to neutralize the threat.

“We had seen two of them (insurgents) moving, crawling away from the area, as to not really make a whole lot of scene. You have two enemy forces that are still alive,” she said. “Permission to engage.”

Marquez went on to say that the ground commander’s refusal to not allow her crew to take out the two terrorists with their weapons would then seal the fate of those involved in Extortion 17.

Now with no way to take out the threat, Marquez and her team were left with little options other than tracking the two enemy insurgents with the surveillance equipment. She watched helplessly as they made their way through an open field, then to a village where they began to rally more terrorists to join the fight. Circa went on:

Meanwhile, a CH-47 Chinook helicopter, with the call sign Extortion 17, was called into the hours-long firefight.

U.S. Central Command’s official investigation concluded that a rocket-launched grenade from a Taliban fighter hit the Chinook and sent the helicopter into a downward spin. The crash killed all 38, including thirty Americans and eight Afghans. Seventeen of the U.S. servicemen were Navy SEALs. Months before, SEALs were made famous for the killing of Osama bin Laden.

“If we would’ve been allowed to engage that night, we would’ve taken out those two men immediately,” Marquez said. She believes with her whole heart that had her team been given permission to take out the terrorists, 38 warriors would still be alive today.

“They continued to essentially gain more and more force behind them because they just kept knocking on doors,” she said. “And the two personnel that initially fled ended up becoming a group of 12 people.”

What’s even more insane is that pleas and warnings from her crew to return the Chinook back to base and cancel the mission before the terrorists began firing just fell on deaf ears by the commanders.

“Whenever we reached out to the Joint Operations Center, they would essentially just push back with, ‘Find a, a good infill location. Find a good helicopter landing zone,’” said Marquez, adding that by the time Extortion 17 was coming in, everything was mired in confusion.

From there, things just got even worse. The Chinook was eventually shot down by the terrorists and crashed to the ground. Marquez watched from her infared monitor as one of the Navy SEALS was then ejected from the burning Chinook helicopter. She watched his heat signature fade from red to blue, knowing that she was watching as his life literally slipped away from his body.

“We had to sit and watch that, and I think that was one of the hardest things that I had to do,” she said. “That man was, you know, dying on the ground.” Marquez says the pain of living with what happened has taken its toll and she was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and is in therapy.

Her account of that fateful day has been corroborated by the Defense Department inspector general in a previously sealed top-secret report. Her own commander also has verified the story has true.

“If we would’ve been allowed to engage that night, we would’ve taken out those two men immediately. I mean, it’s just one of those things where you know that it could’ve all been prevented,” she said, tearing up at times as she recollected that night.

Thirty-eight of our warriors are dead and there is one single person to blame, and that is Barack Hussein Obama, the treasonous POS who sent these warriors straight to their deaths that night. It was because of HIS asinine updates to our military’s rules of engagement back in 2009 that essentially gave precedence to the lives of Muslim terrorists over our own military forces."
114,http://lastdeplorables.com/breaking-federal-judges-invite-muslims-veto-americans-election/,lastdeplorables,BREAKING: Federal Judges Invite Muslims To VETO Americans’ Election,['Robert Amnor'],"Yep, this is going to be a problem.

A total of 10 progressive judges all in Virginia went ahead and decided that Muslims should be able to ask judges to CHANGE the nation’s national security and immigration policies whenever they can be described as unfair to Muslims living in America.

“To the extent that our review chills campaign promises to condemn and exclude entire religious groups, we think that a welcome restraint,” boasted the majority opinion, which was approved by 10 judges on the Richmond-based Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, and announced May 25. President

We know that President Trump’s Executive Order on Islamic migration ““speaks with vague words of national security, but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination” from the 2016 election campaign, the judges insisted.

BUT, now a dissent approved by three judges has pushed the political ambitions and further risks hiding behind the court’s declaration of support for all Islamic plaintiffs. “The danger of the majority’s new rule is that it will enable any court to justify its decision to strike down any executive action with which it disagrees,” says three three-judge dissent, which concluded:

Unless corrected by the Supreme Court, the majority’s new approach, which is unsupported by any Supreme Court case, will become a sword for plaintiffs to challenge facially neutral government actions, particularly those affecting regions dominated by a single religion. Government officials will avoid speaking about religion, even privately, lest a court discover statements that could be used to ascribe a religious motivation to their future actions. And, in the more immediate future, our courts will be faced with the unworkable task of determining when this President’s supposed religious motive [in the 2016 election]has sufficiently dissipated so as to allow executive action toward these or other majority Muslim countries.

This lawsuit is brought by Muslim plaintiffs, and fully backed by a numerous array of establishment progressive corporate lawyers, all against President Trump’s Executive Order of course. An Executive Order that simply ‘TEMPORARILY’ blocked or even just cured Muslim immigration from 6 of the 50 Muslim majority countries…but that wasn’t reasonable enough for them.

The temporary block is only meant to help officials institute new safeguards against Islamic-inspired attacks like the one we just saw in Manchester due to the growing inflow of Muslim immigrants, refugees, and their future American-born children causing an increasingly chaotic and divided nation.

One of the issues is that progressive Democrats and establishment Republicans and business leaders strongly favor continued inflow of cheap workers, extra consumers and it is believed that they are also setting up the way for likely future Democratic voters, regardless of economic and security issues that will have an impact on Americans.

In the dissent authored by Circuit Judge Paul Niemeyer, the three moderate judges scoffed at the 10 judges for ignoring prior Supreme Court guidance. The logic of the 10 judges’ decision, says the dissent, is that any future court: Need only find one [campaign]statement that contradicts the stated reasons for a subsequent executive action and thereby pronounce that reasons for the executive action are a pretext … Moreover, the unbounded nature of the majority’s new rule will leave the President and his Administration in a clearly untenable position for future action. It is undeniable that President Trump will need to engage in foreign policy regarding majority-Muslim nations, including those designated by the Order. And yet the majority now suggests that at least some of those future actions might also be subject to the same challenges upheld today. Presumably, the majority does not intend entirely to stop the President from creating policies that address these nations, but it gives the President no guidelines for “cleansing” himself of the “taint” they have purportedly identified… Finally, the new rule would by itself chill political speech directed at voters seeking to make their election decision. It is hard to imagine a greater or more direct chill on campaign speech than the knowledge that any statement made may be used later to support the inference of some nefarious intent when official actions are inevitably subjected to legal challenges. Indeed, the majority does not even deny that it employs an approach that will limit communication to voters. Instead, it simply opines remarkable that such chilling is “a welcome restraint.”

It is expected that the Supreme Court will cringe at the majority’s adoption of this new rule that has absolutely ZERO limits or bounds.

Unless this is correct by the Supreme Court, the majority’s new approach will then become sharp sword for plaintiffs to challenge facially neutral government actions, especially regions dominated by a single religion. Government officials will avoid speaking about religion, even in private, our courts will then be facing the unworkable task of determining when this President’s supposed religious motive has been sufficiently dissipates to allow executive action toward these or other majority Muslim countries.

It’s way past time that our judicial system is brought to heel. Rather than to do their actual job, many judges have decided to legislate morality by creating law as opposed to interpreting it. If every act by POTUS can be delayed and mucked up by a run amok judge, we’ll never get anything accomplished. We need to demand that judges stop overstepping their bounds and dictating their perverse conception of morality.

The only recourse at this point is appealing every one of these fascist rulings to the SCOTUS. If that fails, we can’t keep waiting for Superman to show up, it time for every patriot in this nation to take their place and realize the real power is with us.

It’s really frustrating isn’t it? I mean, how many abuses of our civil liberties are we going to stand for?"
115,http://lastdeplorables.com/j-k-rowling-received-unexpected-request-twitter-users/,lastdeplorables,J.K. Rowling Received Unexpected Request From Twitter Users,['Robert Amnor'],"J.K. Rowling, the author of Harry Potter, attacked President Trump by saying he is racist and Islamophobe, when she heard about his travel ban and the proposed wall.

She demanded that Trump opens the borders to Muslim refugees, but didn’t expect this to happen.

Rowling who is worth $1 billion last week, wrote on Twitter attacking Trump for beefing up national security so that asylum seekers can be properly examined.

So, Rowling was immediately called out on her hypocrisy and was requested from her to house asylum seekers in her massive mansion to set the example, via Twitter.

The petition received almost 1,000 signatures in less than two hours since it was up. The creator says that because Rowling demanded open borders and more refugees, she should be the first celebrity to welcome them in her “18 spare bedrooms” at her multimillion-dollar manor, or at least in one of them.

Twitter users also initiated a social media campaign called “Tear Down Those Mansion Walls,” in which 92 percent of over 27,000 voters want Rowling to house refugees.

Should @jk_rowling accept my generous offer to fly up to 100 refugees to live in her several mansions? — Mike Cernovich 🇺🇸 (@Cernovich) February 12, 2017

“Since she is a sheltered member of the rich elite, who is very much disconnected from the ugly reality of rape, murder and destruction which many of these refugees bring with them, we think that it is time for her to show some true solidarity,” the petition states.

“J.K. Rowling has 18 spare bedrooms in her mansions in Britain and could easily give 18 refugees a long-time housing, not to mention the space available on her giant property to erect refugee shelters…To make this group of refugees representative of the situation Europe, we also demand that the group consists of 14 men and 4 women, since over 75% of the millions of refugees are male.”

In 2015, Rowling disturbed her entire neighborhood with putting up a 30-foot-high wall around her Edinburgh home. For 3 days, traffic was blocked, is seem like she built a “wall” around herself to keep the unwanted out. How xenophobic.

Now, Rowling lives in an even more luxurious mansion in Aberfeldy. Anyhow, it seems like she doesn’t to want to share the wealth. Aside from not wanting to share her millions, Rowling won’t even give one of her houses to shelter a poor, innocent refugee.

Rowling hasn’t said anything about the petition or about the number of tweets demanding she stops being a hypocrite and does what she’s telling everyone else to do.

Please share this post on Facebook if you think Rowling is a hypocrite.

The skirt also had a black waistband to highlight Melania’s slim frame.

She completed the look with her favourite black sunglasses and a black crocodile skin Hermès Birkin bag.

But after draining our country dry with their lavish vacations to the tune of over $100 million bucks and using their political positions to crap-talk our country for almost a decade, the Obamas are back with their antics in full force. And the ridiculous allegations Michelle Obama is making about Americans is so outrageous, it will make you even more furious this woman was ever given the opportunity to represent the very same country that she so vehemently despises.

After being “dethroned” by the Trumps at the White House, “queen” Michelle is trying desperately to maintain her relevance in American society, which is proving just like her school lunch programs, to be a massive failure. After failing miserably with her attempts to convince the world that she was America’s “sex symbol,” in recent weeks, Michelle is back with her antics, this time taking a direct swipe at the American people with a sickening sob story about how the American people treated her like a black slave during her time as first lady.

Speaking to a crowd of about 8,500 at the Women’s Foundation of Colorado’s 30th anniversary event in Denver, Michelle whined about her “horrific experience” as America’s first black lady, claiming Americans only saw her for the color of her skin.

“The shards that cut me the deepest were the ones that intended to cut,” Obama said. “Knowing that after eight years of working really hard for this country, there are still people who won’t see me for what I am because of my skin color.” It’s runny how Michelle wants to whine about Americans being “racists” towards her, when she is the biggest racist on the face of the planet. As a student at Princeton University, herENTIRE thesis was written to bash white people, where PAGES of radically charged paragraphs were composed to slander the white faculty members and the entire university, that she claimed was specifically designed to “cater to the needs of white students.” Or who can forget Michelle’s disgusting race-baiting commencement speech at the all-black Tuskegee University, where she droned on about how whites “owe black America for slavery,” harping on “white racism” where she brought up sob stories about whites always assuming she was “the help” and questioned her intelligence. Rather than using her position as the first black first lady to bring racial unity and healing, her divisive speech was completely catered to blacks, where she warned the black students they had a “lifetime of hardship” on the horizon due to the blatant racism that exists in America by whites.

“Instead they will make assumptions about who they think you are based on their limited notion of the world,” Michelle whined. “And my husband and I know how frustrating that experience can be. We’ve both felt the sting of those daily slights throughout our entire lives — the folks who crossed the street in fear of their safety; the clerks who kept a close eye on us in all those department stores; the people at formal events who assumed we were the ‘help’ — and those who have questioned our intelligence, our honesty, even our love of this country.”

“It can feel isolating. It can make you feel like your life somehow doesn’t matter. They’re rooted in decades of structural challenges that have made too many folks feel frustrated and invisible. And those feelings are playing out in communities like Baltimore and Ferguson and so many others across this country.”

Apparently Michelle forgets that her husband wouldn’t have been even elected as president TWICE had it not been for the white voters who went out in droves during both the 2008 and 2012 elections, gaining more votes that cracker white Bill Clinton! And yet Michelle feels the need to get on her high horse and whine about “white racism” holding her back? Are you freaking serious?

After 8 years in the white house living life like a queen, vacationing around on the tax payer’s dime (millions of white tax payer dollars I might add), Michelle still feels like she “suffered” as first lady. It just goes to prove that no matter what opportunity and opulent life this ungrateful woman is given, of the fact that she’s raking in millions with her post-White House speeches, the Obamas will always be incessant in their goals to demonize the white race and crap-talk the very country who gave them everything in life."

Liberals hate the idea of a border wall for two reasons. Liberals hate the idea of a border wall for two reasons.

First, it hurts their precious feelings. They get sad when they realize that people need to be deported in order for us to live in a nation of laws.

In their minds, America is a magical place filled with candy and unicorns, where everyone is allowed to just hop in and get free stuff. Little do they know that the real world does not work this way, and that this mentality has devastated our economy.

Second, and perhaps most importantly, liberals hate the wall because they know that its existence would shrink a valuable Democratic voting bloc.

Millions of illegal immigrants vote for Democratic candidates. Whether it’s because they are forced to by local politicians or because they truly support the liberal platform, illegals vote en masse for Democrats.

Since Democrats have come to rely on illegal support to win elections, they bend over backwards to grow the illegal population. They know that any plan to restrict illegal immigration would hurt their electoral chances, and thus they oppose the wall.

As a result, liberals were quick to celebrate when the administration announced that it would delay plans to build a wall. They got so carried away with excitement that they even made fun of the president and his supporters for believing that such a project could be completed in the first place.

Now, however, the joke is on them.

As reported by Fox News:

The agency in charge of U.S. border security plans to start building prototypes for President Trump’s proposed wall with Mexico later this summer."

That’s why the president didn’t hold back when he was renegotiating the production cost of the new Air Force One, and from this will benefit not only him but the other presidents yet to come. Trump even get the Air Force One to look similar to the Trump Tower in Manhattan.

Here are some photos:

As you can see, the Air Force one looks like a five-star hotel, and Trump knows how to negotiate so the costs are far less and the product is remarkable too.

We are proud that he is the one enjoying that majestic plane, because he deserved it and will be using it for a long time now.

And we expect for liberals to start complaining any time now of how he spent too much of America’s funds for his protection. But he wouldn’t have had to if they stopped making chaos across America.

The Day Trump Gets Back – Forgets He’s Not Pres Anymore,['Robert Amnor'],"Obama has had an extremely difficult time relinquishing the power he was held as president of the Untied States, as he’s spent every waking moment in recent months obsessing on ways to take out President Trump with his “resistance movement.” Over the past week, Obama’s jealousy was on full display while Trump was in Germany for the G-20 Summit meeting, where Obama was caught breaking federal law to hold a secret meeting with the South Korean president. Now in an effort to up his game of subversion against President Trump, Obama has just abruptly ended his international vacation to fly back to Washington D.C. for another meeting cloaked in secrecy, proving yet again just how far he’s willing to go in order to get President Trump removed from office.

Obama’s antics over the past week in order to sabotage President Trump have been nothing short of startling. We reported several days ago how Obama secretly met with South Korean President Moon ae-in last week in order to discuss “dealing with Trump” for over 40 minutes, which was a straight up act of illegal subversion on Obama’s part. As Obama was busy parading around and pretending to still be president of the United States, he missed the fact that holding a diplomatic foreign meeting as a civilian is a direct violation of the Logan Act and a serious federal crime. But unfortunately for President Trump, Obama was just getting warmed up with his plans to get rid of Trump for good.

What’s hilarious is that no matter what Obama and his band of Democratic cronies do to take down Trump, their plans keep imploding in their faces. Scandals surrounding Democrats continue to impede any type of momentum liberals have towards an impeachment on Trump, just take a look at how CNN and MSNBC (the propaganda wing of their “resistance movement”) have been going down in flames in recent weeks.

Democrats are also licking their wounds after their high hopes for getting Trump impeached over the “Russian election conspiracy” was officially killed this weekend, after President Trump discussed the issue with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their closed-door meeting at the G-20 summit. Compound the issue that the Democratic Party has no real prospects to run against Trump in 2020, and it’s easy to see why Obama and liberals are panicking, as all their plans to get rid of Trump are currently going down in flames. After a devastating last month, Obama is now kicking his antics into full gear, where he will be heading a fundraiser in Washington D.C. this week in a desperate attempt to “woo donors” to invest in political races.” The Hill reported:

Former President Barack Obama will headline a fundraiser in Washington, D.C., this week.

He’s set to appear Thursday at a closed-door event for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, the Washington Post reported.

Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez told the Post that Obama wants to help “build the bench” for the Democrats.

NDRC Executive Director, Kelly Ward would not say how much Obama’s appearance is expected to bring in, said he “still has such a microphone” to woo donors to invest in state-level races.

“That bully pulpit still very much rests with him,” Ward told the Post.

Obama wants to support the committee’s “efforts to address unfair gerrymandering practices that leave too many American voters feeling voiceless in the electoral process,” spokesman Kevin Lewis said.

“Restoring fairness to our democracy by advocating for fairer, more inclusive district maps around the country is a priority for President Obama,” he added.

The desperation of the Democratic Party is quite entertaining at this point as all their plans keep imploding in their faces. While it’s legal for Obama to hold fundraisers, what’s not legal is for him to be conspiring with world leaders in a civilian capacity to influence our government behind Trump’s back. Obama better wakes up soon and realize that he isn’t President of the United States anymore. His antics in South Korea were a serious federal crime, and it’s time that President Trump puts an end to this nonsense as Obama isn’t showing signs of backing up anytime soon in his pursuits to get Trump removed from office."

We see the devastating effects of countries who allow Muslims to flood their countries, just take a look at what’s going on in Europe. While President Trump is doing everything in his power to keep these third world country vermin out of America, a Muslim who came into our country under Obama was just caught in a sickening act of terrorism that has Ohio residents completely traumatized, proving once again that we need to round every last Muslim migrant up and deport their asses back to the Middle East where they belong.

Yahya Farooq Mohammad is a Muslim who came here in 2008 from the United Arab Emirates and decided to make Ohio his new home. But he had little intentions for peacefully assimilating into his new country as authorities would soon learn. Not long after migrating here from his terror-ridden country, Mohammad hooked up with notorious now-dead terrorist recruiter Anwar Al-Awlaki, later traveling to Yemen to provide the terrorist with thousands of dollars and equipment to carry out future terror attacks.

But that was unfortunately just the beginning. After being investigated, charged, and jailed while awaiting his sentence, Mohammad then set out to inflict jihad on the federal judge presiding over his case, a plot that was luckily discovered right before the judge was brutally assassinated. The Blade reported:

A man awaiting trial in the Lucas County jail for providing financial support to the al-Quaeda terrorist network was charged late today with trying to get U.S. District Court Judge Jack Zouhary assassinated.

Federal investigators claim Yahya Farooq Mohammad, 37, of the United Arab Emirates, not only wanted the judge dead but also wanted his would-be assassin to make sure his body was not found.

Mr. Mohammad was indicted by a federal grand jury in Toledo for attempted first-degree murder of a federal officer, solicitation to commit a crime of violence, and use of interstate commerce facilities in the commission of murder-for-hire.

He is believed to have put a contract out on the judge’s life from his jail cell.

The indictment claims he told a fellow inmate at the Lucas County jail he would pay $15,000 to have Judge Zouhary, who is presiding over his terrorism case, killed. Prosecutors presented evidence that showed Mr. Mohammad arranged for his wife to make a $1,000 downpayment, which she did on May 5, according to the indictment.

“When asked when he wanted the murder committed, Mohammad stated, ‘The sooner would be good, you know,’” the indictment said.

Federal prosecutors said Mr. Mohammad did so to obstruct the terrorism case against him.

“This prosecution seeks to hold the defendant accountable for attempting to victimize the judge and for trying to undermine our criminal justice system,” Barbara L. McQuade, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, said in a news release.

Agent Stephen D. Anthony of the FBI’s Cleveland Field Division spoke about the case, saying that Mohammad will now face serious additional federal charges that will add decades onto his sentence:

“Conspiring to have a judge killed is not the way to avoid being prosecuted. Now Mohammad will be held accountable for additional serious federal charges,” Anthony stated.

Chillingly, Mohammad’s entire family who lives in the United States were also busted in the terrorism plot and are awaiting sentencing. The Blade went on:

Mohammad along with his brother, Ibrahim Zubair Mohammad, 36, of Euless, Texas; and brothers, Sultane Roome Salim, 41, of Columbus and Asif Ahmed Salim, 35, who most recently lived in the United Arab Emirates, are awaiting trial in that case.

All but Sultane Roome Salim are being held in the Lucas County jail. Magistrate Judge James Knepp allowed Mr. Salim to be released on a $500,000 property bond with strict conditions that he live with his mother and wife in Cambridge, Ohio.

Judge Zouhary denied bond for Ibrahim Zubair Mohammad and Asif Ahmed Salim, saying it was probable they would not appear for future court hearings.

This incident just further proves that Muslims will never adopt a peaceful way of life or assimilate into western civilization, despite the propaganda that they left continues to spew about the “religion of peace.” Hopefully President Trump’s migrant ban will help alleviate this problem, but that doesn’t solve the issue of the 3.3 million Muslims that are currently living in America who daily are becoming more radicalized with what they’re being taught in their mosques. It’s more important than ever that we make the commitment to become proficient with firearms and carry a gun for protection wherever we go. In the end, the only thing that will stop Muslims from committing terror attacks on our soil is an armed populace!"

Through an intricate and secretive network of powerful organizations, Soros exerts his will in countries throughout the world. He uses his billions to fund his army of true believers will stop at nothing to help him implement his open borders/one world agenda. Do you like your constitution? Too bad. He thinks he knows better. Love your flag and your nation’s sovereignty? Too bad. You’re a backward traditionalist. He is an evil megalomaniac who wants to force sovereign peoples to comply with his vision of a better world

The movement, Stop Operation Soros (SOS), is a grass roots effort to uproot all his evil organizations working within Macedonia. It doesn’t stop there. SOS leaders are calling on citizens all across the world to “fight against one-mindedness in the civil sector, which is devised and led by George Soros.” SOS is currently attacking more than 70 of Soros’ organizations. Hungry, the country where Soros was born, has also begun a similar effort to uproot his organizations from the nation.

According to RT:

A new initiative, Stop Operation Soros (SOS), dedicated to countering the influence of American billionaire activist George Soros, has been launched in Macedonia.

In a press conference on Tuesday, the founders of the group called on all “free-minded citizens,” regardless of ethnicity or religion, to join them in the “fight against one-mindedness in the civil sector, which is devised and led by George Soros,” the Vecer newspaper reported. The movement says it will first focus on uncovering ‘subversive’ activities by Soros-funded NGOs.

According to Nikola Srbov, a columnist for pro-government news portal Kurir and co-founder of SOS, Soros-funded NGOs have monopolized civil society in Macedonia and used their position to suppress dissenting views.

“We’ve witnessed the takeover of the entire civil sector and its abuse and instrumentalization to meet the goals of one political party. That is unacceptable and goes beyond the principles of civic organizing,” Srbov said at the press conference.

“The Open Society Foundation, operating under the Soros umbrella, used its funding and personnel to support violent processes in Macedonia. It has monopolized the civil society sector, pushing outside any organization which disagrees with the Soros ideology,” he stated.

Another co-founder, Cvetin Cilimanov, editor-in-chief of the state-run MIA news agency, accused Soros’s Open Society Foundations of undermining Macedonian sovereignty by working not only with the opposition center-left SDSM party, but also with outside interests. By cooperating with foreign embassies and organizations such as USAID, Cilimanov believes Soros-backed groups have interfered in the political process of Macedonia.

“This is unacceptable and has largely contributed to a feeling in the public that the traditional relations of partnership Macedonia enjoyed with some countries are being undermined,” Cilimanov told journalists.

A third founder of the initiative and editor-in-chief of the Republika news portal, Nenad Mircevski, declared that the group would work towards the “de-Soros-ization” of Macedonia, echoing a speech made by former prime minister and leader of the ruling VMRO-DPMNE party Nikola Gruevski in December. In the speech, Gruevski accused foreign powers and Soros-backed organizations of meddling in Macedonian politics.

Opposition figures have expressed concern at the rhetoric used by Gruevski, fearing the start of a crackdown on dissent and advocacy groups.

The Open Society Foundation (OSF) was set up by Hungarian-born Soros between the mid-1980s to early 1990s with the stated aim of helping former Eastern bloc countries transition from communism. However, aside from its support for progressive causes such as drug policy reform, the OSF has also been involved in political activities and Soros publically supported the violent overthrow of the legitimately-elected government in Ukraine during the ‘Euromaidan’ revolution. This has earned him the ire of Russian authorities, which in 2015 banned Soros and his foundations as a threat to national security.

Soros and his foundations have come under scrutiny elsewhere as well. In an interview with the internet portal 888.hu in December, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that 2017 would bring about “the extrusion of George Soros and the forces symbolized by him.” Orban has accused Soros of undermining European borders and values by helping facilitate the flow of refugees and asylum seekers from the Middle East and elsewhere. During a Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything), WikiLeaks’ Julian Assange also blasted the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, funded by Soros, for focusing “exclusively on negative stories about Russia and former Soviet states.”

It’s about time some leaders have summoned the courage to stand up to this evil man. They are putting their people and traditions ahead of the utopian promises that Soros and Obama are trying to cram down peoples throats. We need to speak out and demand that our leaders do the same thing these other countries are doing. President Trump surely knows all about Soros. Let’s encoura

125,http://ladylibertysnews.com/australia-calling-total-ban-muslim-immigration-mosques-burkas/,ladylibertysnews,"Aussie Senator Is Demanding A Complete Ban On Muslim Mosques, Migration And Burkas",['Todd Cooney'],"At least one Australian senator has woken up and smelled the radical Islamic terrorism.

AUSTRALIA IS “IN DANGER OF BEING SWAMPED BY MUSLIMS” RESULTING IN ITS PEOPLE “LIVING UNDER SHARIA LAW” UNLESS THE COUNTRY RADICALLY CHANGES ITS IMMIGRATION POLICY, A NEWLY-ELECTED SENATOR HAS SAID. We MUST pay much closer attention to so called “peaceful” Muslims. I always say that if the known violent radical Islamic terrorists are the snakes, the so-called moderate Muslims are the grass they hide in. Pauline Hanson, leader of the One Nation party, used her maiden speech in the Australian Senate to claim Islam has a “hyper-masculine culture” that is incompatible with Australian society, and that migrants who had already arrived and not “assimilated” should “go back from where you came from.” “If it would be of any help, I’ll take you to the airport and wave you goodbye with sincere best wishes,” she added. In a speech that provoked Green senators to walk out, Ms Hanson also claimed there was no way of distinguishing between “good” and “bad” Muslims. “Our leaders continue to tell us to be tolerant and to embrace the good Muslims,” she said. “But how should we tell the difference? There is no sign saying ‘good Muslim’ or ‘bad Muslim’. How many lives will be lost or destroyed trying to determine who is good and who is bad?”

Pauline Hanson is a former member of the centre-right Liberal Party who founded One Nation as an anti-establishment group to pursue her old party from the right.

In 2003 she was imprisoned after being convicted of fraud, but was released after 11 weeks when her conviction was overturned on appeal.

The party achieved its best ever results in this year’s elections, with four members elected to the Federal Senate. The sudden rise in popularity was seen as a rebuke to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who ousted conservative Tony Abbott in an internal party coup last year.

The Australian Herald Sun wrote after her speech yesterday:

“When Hanson gave her maiden speech in the House of Representatives 20 years and four days ago, Liberals boycotted it. This time they do not dare. Hanson is too powerful, with her four Senate votes and huge popularity – not to mention her scars. “Turnbull’s nightmare has a new chapter. How can he repudiate what she says, other than to say it is not wise to say what in many respects is either the truth or the sentiment of so many Australians, most of them too scared until now to say so?

Steve Emerson, the Executive Director of the Investigative Project on Terrorism, stressed that the data undoubtedly proves the notion that nonviolent Islamist organizations definitely “serve as potential incubators for radicalization and violence.”

The brainwashed Muslim group members move on to participate in vicious agitation, inspiring others to perform terrorist attacks, Emerson reported.

It’s the inability to identify and pinpoint the roles of nonviolent jihadists that causes the FBI and other law enforcement agencies to fail in the fight against radical Islamic terrorism.

We must cut the crap and wake up to expose these snakes for who they really are.

The big problem, however, is that the snowflake generation will squeal “racism” and refuse to read anything that differs from what CNN feeds them.

Hopefully the latest fallout form the Russia investigation nothing-burgers will help.

Democrats have succeeded in totally changing the leftists’ interpretation of open conversation. As long as you preach leftist, pro Islamic content it’s acceptable. Anything else is shouted down or rejected and ridiculed.

To top it all off, the lying liberal mainstream media see themselves as the overlords of our society, and they attempt to instruct people whom to vote for, how to think etc. Western civilization is in a very bad place right now, what the snowflakes do not grasp is that they are following the pied piper over the cliff of their own demise, willingly and enthusiastically.

Enough is enough.

Thank God we now have President Trump, who couldn’t have gotten into office soon enough!! It’s time to start healing our nation’s horrible wounds…I only hope that it’s not too late… It’s been a long eight years.

Thanks to Obama, a drug dealer who had been released early from prison due to one of his pardon programs wound up murdering a woman and her children. He was putting cancer cells back into our society in a strong attempt to destroy the country from within.

He now has blood on his hands thanks to scumbags like these being let loose too soon due to reduced sentences.

More from Judicial Watch:

A convicted crack dealer who left prison early as part of the Obama administration’s mass release of federal inmates has been indicted by a grand jury for fatally stabbing his ex-girlfriend and her two kids in Columbus, Ohio. The gory crime drew national attention because the children, ages 7 and 10, were murdered to eliminate them as witnesses in the brutal massacre of their 32-year-old mother.This week a grand jury in Franklin County returned a 10-count, death-penalty indictment against the ex-con, 35-year-old Wendell Callahan, for the triple murders. Callahan broke into his ex-girlfriend’s apartment and stabbed the three victims, according to a statement issued by Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O’Brien announcing the indictment. Callahan should have been in jail when the crimes occurred, but he was released four years early because federal sentencing guidelines for crack dealers got reduced. The change is part of President Obama’s effort to reform the nation’s justice system as a way of ending racial discrimination. The initiative was technically launched back in 2010 when the president signed a measure that for the first time in decades relaxed drug-crime sentences he claimed discriminated against poor and minority offenders. This severely weakened a decades-old law enacted during the infamous crack cocaine epidemic that ravaged urban communities nationwide in the 1980s. As part of the movement the U.S. Sentencing Commission lowered maximum sentences for drug offenders and made it retroactive, leading to the early release of thousands of violent thugs like Callahan. In November the administration began releasing 6,000 drug convicts coined “non-violent” offenders whose sentences were too long under the old guidelines. News reports quickly surfaced contradicting the administration’s assessment that the newly released convicts were not violent. Among them was the leader of a multi-million dollar operation that smuggled drugs from Canada to Maine. Prosecutors refer to the 29-year-old con as a “drug kingpin” who was one of “America’s Most Wanted.” Shortly before the administration’s mass release of drug convicts, federal prosecutors warned that drug trafficking is inherently violent and therefore the phrase “non-violent drug offenders” is a misnomer. The nation’s prosecutors also cautioned that reducing prison sentences for drug offenders will weaken their ability to bring dangerous drug traffickers to justice.

This contradicts the media’s narrative, so they’ll never say a word about this.

We are now living among monsters thanks to Obama’s anti-American radical leftist agenda.

A convicted crack dealer who left prison early as part of the Obama administration’s mass release of federal inmates has been indicted by a grand jury for fatally stabbing his ex-girlfriend and her two kids in Columbus, Ohio. The gory crime drew national attention because the children, ages 7 and 10, were murdered to eliminate them as witnesses in the brutal massacre of their 32-year-old mother.

Think about that. Obama thought that was okay in our society.

If he was selling crack, the enterprise is based on violence. That’s why it is classified differently and why criminals are sentenced accordingly.

Gitmo detainees released back to the battlefield, to kill US soldiers. Prisoners released back to the street, to kill US citizens. Thank you, Obama.

Now a convicted felon is released by executive pardon and murders his family because liberal ideology cannot connect the dots between drug dealers arrests and murder and mayhem. There is a river of blood on his hands. SOCIALISM KILLS.

But Obama said most of these people aren’t violent criminals, and that they just made a couple of minor mistakes.

What a disaster he created. Enough is enough, we need to get our streets clean again and make it safe for our kids to grow and prosper in this great nation!

Thank God for President Trump, who is curing America of this cancer as quickly as possible!

In this case, that misery is named Susan Rice. The former Obama security advisor is feeling the heat again by the House Committee.

Rice has already testified before the House Intel Committee about her involvement in the unmasking and the illegal surveillance of Trump and his campaign team. These new hearings are bringing in the big dogs from the FBI, NSA and the CIA. They will be questioned under oath regarding what they know about Rice’s unmasking activities. The committee will also examine the records of former US Ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power.

This new probe is liable to open up new identities of people loyal to Obama that were involved in the surveillance actions. This means that we get closer to unmasking the real mover behind these events….the former president.

A source told Fox News that the House Committee hearings are only the beginning in a potentially growing case. Some “unmasking” requests may deserve “more explanation” according to the source, Catherine Herridge, who is a highly respected and prolific intelligence correspondent. What that really means is that there are more questions than answers at this time.

What is interesting is that Rice recently recused herself from the latest subpoena. She no longer has that option. Obama can’t protect her now.

Rice tried to play the innocent game early on by acting as if she knew nothing. Unfortunately for her, there are a few staunch Republicans that are refusing to let her off. For anyone with eyes to see, this woman was deeply involved in these illegal activities. She bet her freedom that Hillary would be elected and make all this go away. She bet wrong.

Here is Herridge’s video about her information.

Time to put these fact finding committee meetings behind us and get the prosecution started. Rice and others are complicit and they need to face their day in court.

Make this go viral to get the message out.

As the highest law enforcement officer in the land, one expects this person to be honest and above reproach. During Obama’s eight years in office, both of his selected AG’s demonstrated the opposite of integrity.

Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch demonstrated the lengths they would go to in violating their oath of office. To that end, one of the most credible voices in American journalism agrees with that assessment. Lou Dobbs recently came out and castigated Obama’s DOJ as corrupt beyond compare.

His own words display that perspective best as seen in the video below.

A few thoughts now on what is inarguably the most politically corrupt department in the History of the American government. I’m speaking of course of the Obama Justice Department, led by two attorneys general Eric holder, who ultimately became the first saving cabinet officer ever to be cited for contempt of Congress, and his successor who is working on matching his record, Loretta Lynch, who according to the fired director of the FBI obstructed justice and ordering James Comey to refer to the Clinton email investigation as a matter, rather than an investigation for the purpose of the Clinton campaign to deny the Democratic nominee was under federal investigation.





Dobbs continues to relate how the actions of AG Lynch allowed the meeting that liberals are using to attack Donald Trump Jr. His meeting with the Russian lawyer was in his mind above board and simply to hear what she had to say about Hillary Clinton.

For interest’s sake, Donald Jr. did not use any of the information given him and left the meeting. What is worth noting according to Dobbs is that Lynch invited the Russian attorney into the U.S. with no visa. That is where the scandal is…a member of the government breaking American entrance rules. An AG no less.

Then the Russian stays here five months beyond her waiver. No one in the general public could pull that off. Seems the AG played favorites in an attempt to create a scandal against our President.

There is more to the story in regards to Lynch and Hillary Clinton. Partisan politics appears to be the main venue as Lynch attempted to deceive the American people.

Dobbs is right. Obama’s DOJ was the most corrupt in memory and there should be a real investigation by the current DOJ.

Watch the entirety of this video then share it on Facebook and Twitter."

When Congress passed it in 2009, the country knew it was in for one big mess.

Death panels, high costs for lower and middle class, no choice of personal physicians. All of these and more established Obamacare for what it was.

Conservatives for years said they would seek its repeal. Some did not want to get into the healthcare business. Let it go private…as in reality it should.

But anyway, Conservatives stated all along that they would fight to remove the fiasco of Obamacare and put in something better.

Now the Legislature is facing a firestorm from many directions about its lack of moving things along…like their promise. They are at a standstill about whether to simply repeal Obamacare and replace it later or get a working healthcare in place that is good for Americans.

Now President Trump is weighing in a gathering of himself and a few prominent Republican Senators, Trump unleashed his “thoughts” about the GOP snail’s pace. His lunch was a time for him to tell these people to get off their butts and get something accomplished.

He basically told them they needed to stay in DC and get healthcare resolved before heading home in August. No mincing words about it.

To make his point stronger, he placed Senator Dean Heller next to him at the luncheon. This pro-Obamacare Senator was Trump’s point of focus as he called Heller out as no friend to the GOP if he didn’t back a change.

Trump was adamant that healthcare had to be put together.

What the media has become is alarming.

We need a free press, but our press has abused its freedoms and morphed into a leftist war machine, focusing on nothing-burgers like CNN themselves recently admitted with the Russia story, to things President Trump tweets rather than what he actually DOES!

We can no longer afford a press that is bought out by predominantly leftist personal interests and radical political agendas. This has to stop, and independent free press corps must go back to reporting the truth and facts.

Do you agree, folks?

If stuff like what you are about to see was on the 6 o’clock news and was front page news (as it should be, it is relevant information), very few people would be pro-immigration.

If you are in favor of bringing refugees to America, this is what you’re asking for.

Without a permit, thousands of Muslims took over streets of New York City for the call to prayer. Allahu Akbar rang through the streets. The mainstream media isn’t reporting this. This was in support of Standing Rock and against the so-called “Muslim ban” that isn’t a Muslim ban.

Communist mayor de Blasio did nothing about it.

The lying, fake news mainstream media outlets won’t tell you all of this or report any of it.

If they did, much less people would vote left/liberal/democrat

But that is the thing, people don’t know because the mainstream media does not want people to know. They bury stories like this.

The mainstream media as it is now and has been since roughly the 1970s should be destroyed and rebuilt from the ground up. It is rotten to the core and is so far from neutral and balanced, it boggles the mind how can anyone claim the mainstream media is not working for the left.

The mainstream media is the propaganda arm, it is the indoctrination , the brainwashing department of the left/liberals/democrats.

News on Trump is over 90% negative, and was about as negative for Bush, Reagan, Nixon…and News about Obama was almost always positive news.

It is almost mathematically impossible that a President only does good things every second of the day for 8 years as the media had us believe about Obama and it is almost mathematically impossible that a man does only bad things every second of the day as the media wants us to believe about Trump.

There must have been times when Obama was bad and when Trump was/is good. Just like it can not rain every day or be sunny every day.

Yet the media presents things exactly this way; only bad news about the right, only good news about the left.

The media is a joke….there are more fake things on the news than in a magic show.

The media is a lying machine.

What is worse is that I see people I care about who are so brainwashed they do not even know they are brainwashed. They believe the silliest things, they are like zombies, they seem to have no brains.

Whatever the media tells them is their opinion, becomes their opinion, and they get angry at you if you try to educate them on what is the complete story (like Muslims blocking streets without a permit and if you did that you or me – a non-Muslim – we’d be in jail).

The mainstream media is rotten to the core, and should be destroyed and rebuilt from the ground up.

He sought to secure this nation from those that would seek asylum from nations with a history of terrorism. All he wanted was to allow for proper vetting to occur.

The purpose of his ban was to prevent terrorists and criminals from entering into the U.S. Predictably, liberals had a meltdown. They called Trump everything from uncaring to a “monster.” On the contrary, Obama was the evil one in this whole escapade as he opened the floodgates and let in millions of improperly vetted high risk refugees. He would put citizens in harm’s way.

Since liberals don’t care about American culture and sovereignty, they immediately set out to undermine our commander in chief’s executive order. So libs started using lower courts to stop Trump’s travel ban. He faced activist judges that began saying “no” to his agenda. But that was changed recently by the High Court.

The U.S. Supreme Court just declared that Trump can enforce his ban on refugees. ABCNews reports that the Court also allowed for a smaller ban about grandparent travel.

SCOTUS put a stop to liberals attempting to derail Trump’s plans. Previously, a lower court judge ordered that the government should continue to allow refugees working in a resettlement plan to carry on.

A sitting president has every right to do what is necessary to protect our shores and her people. Trump has the backbone to say that what is happening in Europe is not headed to America.

Leftists want to allow as many people into this country unchecked as possible. To them it makes them seem tolerant. True tolerance comes from defending a nation from those that would subvert her freedoms.

“This ruling jeopardizes the safety of thousands of people across the world including vulnerable families fleeing war and violence,” said Naureen Shah of Amnesty International.

The Muslim Brotherhood, the party and movement that Obama so repulsively revered, is undoubtedly an incubator for homegrown terror in the US.

Here is the problem put simply: An Islamist is a radical Muslim is a “moderate” Muslim – they are all the same – and just because parties like the Muslim Brotherhood preach non-violence doesn’t mean they’r peaceful at all, because talk is cheap, and while they sell garbage as gold to the naïve liberals of our societies, they are polluting the minds of the next generation of violent Jihadists.

That’s the result of a fresh study that traces the development of 100 prominent jihadists within the global Islamic society.

We MUST pay much closer attention to so called “peaceful” Muslims. I always say that if the known violent radical Islamic terrorists are the snakes, the so-called moderate Muslims are the grass they hide in.

FROM US HERALD:

“We saw this mass migration, this people movement, which is a historic people movement of Muslims from Islamic nations tending to be the most radicalized nations — from those nations into nations that are known as Western Christendom.” Representative [former], Michell Bachmann (R-MN)

Yes, we did, and yes we are. What do you think this means? Do you really believe that as the countries of the Middle East empty out, and their degenerates are vomited out upon the Western World, that they are simply “refugees?”

That they are trying to escape tyrannical madness? If you do, you are a moron. They bring their anti-human ways with them—gang raping all genders and ages, killing people, committing terrorist acts, screaming for Shariah Law, and are getting their way.

This is, as Bachmann calls it, a “planned invasion.” This is a well-thought out effort, the purpose of which is “destroying Western Christendom,” she said while speaking to Jan Markell of Understanding the Times radio show (2-6).

Funny thing, “…you don’t see this mass migration into Russia, or into China, or into Indonesia,” states Bachmann. She’s right. It’s because those nation will stomp their derrieres for even trying to pull the vile things they pull in Western countries;

“This is a planned invasion, not only in Europe but also in the United States.”

“I believe for the specific purpose of destroying Western Christendom, because that has been the strength of the world, economically, but also the strength of the world in terms of leadership, the nations that are known as Western Christendom.”

The brainwashed Muslim group members move on to participate in vicious agitation, inspiring others to perform terrorist attacks, Emerson reported.

It’s the inability to identify and pinpoint the roles of nonviolent jihadists that causes the FBI and other law enforcement agencies to fail in the fight against radical Islamic terrorism.

Quite obviously, any thinking person should have come to the–rather ineluctable–conclusion by now that we have a problem with Muslims in this country. The West has a problem with Muslims and so does the rest of the world. Islam itself is a problem.

These ‘lone-wolf’ terrorists and the ‘organised’ terrorist groups like Boko Haram, ISIS and the others are in fact following a ‘script’ provided to them by Mohammed and friends in the Koran and the various collections of Hadith. They are being ‘good’ Muslims. Islam is a violent ideology crafted to induce terror and ‘inspire’ submission, subjugation and bring about a Muslim world order. It is a political ideology designed for conquest.

The media keep kicking ’round the sound bite that ‘Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance’ when in fact 14 centuries of history, modern ‘spectacle’ and their own holy writ shows the exact opposite. Most Muslims do not commit acts of terror, but most do in fact ‘cherish’ radical beliefs that are the antithesis of our core values and beliefs. They largely despise our culture, our institutions and us, yet we ‘invite’ them in and wonder at all the mayhem that ensues.

The ‘Progressive’ Leftists play us into their hands with their new-found religion of Multiculturalism, its catechism of Censorship and its rosary of Denial. Obama was a shill, hamstrung by his own ideology. Clinton would have been more of the same.

We need to wake up and expose these snakes for who they really are."
134,http://ladylibertysnews.com/secret-meeting-trump-mattis-changes-everything/,ladylibertysnews,The SECRET MEETING Between Trump and Mattis Changes EVERYTHING!,"[""Alen O'Neill""]","Liberals hate a strong military. Why? Because it means the nation is making a mark against all enemies foreign and domestic. Under Obama the military continued to be cut in budget and ability. The overall strength was diminished by reducing the ranks of the men and women in uniform.

The former president also low balled their morale. The shooting at Ft. Hood a few years ago was classified as workplace violence. The shooter was a Muslim in uniform, thus a terrorist. The VA continued to spiral downward due to corruption and second class priority by Obama.

Now President Trump has inspired our troops to be proud again. Their Commander-and-Chief respects their mission in the world. He proved that by placing warriors at the helm of the Pentagon he could inspire the troops and restore a more lethal force. No more pink unicorns.

The new Secretary of Defense is a former soldier and understands the military. So, when he gave Trump amazing news about ISIS being cut down, you know the President paid close attention. As James “Bulldog” Mattis related to Trump, ISIS is “falling fast.”

The two-hour meeting included Trump, Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, VP Mike Pence and other important cabinet members. Secured in the room known as “The Tank”, they discussed many important issues important to national security. Of course, the liberal media was aghast that they could not attend the gathering.

All these men know that no good can come from allowing the liberal press to be privy to their meetings.

We thank this president and the military for making ISIS take to the hills. Once they are obliterated, people will have to be more grateful for President Trump.

Not surprisingly, the liberals will deny Trump any credit for destroying this terrorist menace. Conservatives were gracious with Obama when he killed Osama bin Laden. But liberals will never do the same for Trump. They only care about their partisan politics.

Let’s let Trump and Mattis know their constant vigil in keeping America safe is greatly appreciated. Make the story go viral.

They bring their culture, laws, and lifestyle to our towns and show no respect to the local populace. In fact, they are often highly intolerant of their guests who have shown them nothing but kindness.

But what is worse is when the radical elements embedded within the refugees get into action. They are waging their own form of jihad right here in small town America with acts meant to intimidate and show that “infidels” better fall into line.

Shelbyville, Tennessee is a perfect example of an American town facing this kind of struggle for power. Last year three churches were were shot at and people were bullied. The refugees that attacked these faith centers showed what they were willing to do to establish their control through force.

The Horse Mountain Church of Christ was shot 16 more times the night of Sep 29. The Philippi United Methodist Church along with another church were also struck by 7.62 rounds on the 29th. All of these attacks coincided with people being assaulted on local streets. It was definitely a coordinated effort with similarities to other campaigns in Europe, for instance.

Minnesota has become a Sharia haven for many of the refugees from Islamic countries. Somali is sending them some of the more vicious entrants into America. This is the group that descended upon Shelbyville last year. People in this quiet community have been living under an umbrella of fear because of these Muslim scum.

Currently no one speaks out

Mainstream media will not cover this type of news because they may “embarass” or “insult” the Muslim people. But let a Christian return the favor, the news will light up the airwaves with exposure to the Christian subject.

Islam is attempting to do here what they have forced upon Europe. The refugee population hides a segment that are violent and terroristic. They shoot, bomb, assault and kill to to get their point across.

Precisely the actions they took by shooting at the churches.

The Somalians that come here and push their ways are usually militant in nature. They train in their country to perform terrorism here and other countries. That is why it is important that local leaders dissuade the entrance of these people into their communities.

According to Shelbyville Times-Gazette reporter Brian Mosely;

“They’ve had an impact here. Unfortunately, it’s not been a good impact,”

As he puts it, the refugee Somalians come to the community and have been rude and demanding. They try to make the citizens abide by their way-of-life, instead of assimilating. In fact, these immigrants get hostile towards small businesses that do not play their games.

Then when things escalated to the church shootings, no reporting was taken by any of the major news outlets. As usual liberal media glossed over any incidences. The only news group to report anything was Jihad Watch;

“A Muslim shoots up three churches and nothing is said about his motive or his Islamic identity. Would the same courtesy be shown a Christian who shot up three mosques? Why the cover-up? Who is responsible for it?

Leftists do not care how communities are facing this form of hostility by Islam. All they care is that they get the power they seek. If it means it takes militant Muslims to coerce people, so be it.

President Trump is pushing forward on making this country safer. But it will take all patriots to stand-up and tell these scum no to their way of life.

Share this on Facebook and Twitter. People need to be made aware.

They do so with careful planning over a long period of time. Time after time liberals have played the game of corruption, then try to make it out to be a conservative activity.

Don’t take our word for it. Let the words of someone else who knows speak the truth.

The video below speaks to how Democrats have colluded with foreign enemies of this country for decades. Jessie Waters was on Fox and Friends and had these amazing things to say about the Democratic Party. And that they have been wheeling and dealing like this for years.

VIDEO: Jesse Watters shuts Juan Williams up — gives him a history lesson on the DEMOCRATS’ connections to Russia! pic.twitter.com/e3E2O330V8 — Newt-Trump Fan Club (@NewtTrump) July 16, 2017

Fox Contributor Juan Williams is as liberal as they come. Yet Jessie Waters brought him to reality about the activity of the Democrats in their historic scandals. Trump knows how to work with foreign powers, friend or foe. He sets the benchmark high on how this country will relate to those that seek her harm. History has shown that it is liberal presidents that have colluded with the enemy.

Examples would be:

China receiving satellite technology in exchange for money from Chinese in 1996 election…Bill won.

Hillary buys uranium from Hillary Clinton…guess what, she is a Democrat.

Barack Obama paid billions to North Korea and Iran…both making threats now about nuclear missile technology they have.

The liberal media never mention these things because they play footsie with Democrats. The DOJ should press forward on the prosecution of Clinton and Obama.

How do you feel about the list above and do you think Democrats are the true liars?"

From: Subject Politics

JEFF SESSIONS WAS JUST OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED AS TRUMP’S ATTORNEY GENERAL…BUT THE MEDIA DOESN’T WANT YOU TO SEE WHAT HE ANNOUNCED BEFORE HE WAS CONFIRMED!

Scroll down for video….

Ever since Trump introduced his temporary immigration ban from 7 countries with strong ties to terrorism, the liberal media has tried to call him a racist liar.

Mainstream media has repeatedly claimed that no refugees from the 7 countries are known terrorists. This led to a judge blocking Trump’s order!

Before being confirmed as Attorney General, Jeff Sessions made an announcement and EXPOSED the lying media! (SEE BELOW)

Jeff Sessions complied a list of 19 REFUGEES who have been convicted for TERRORISM! As you’ll see, many of them came to the US from the 7 “banned” countries:

Bilal Abood – Iraq – pledged support to ISIS Aws Mohammed Younis Al-Jayab – Iraq – pledged support to ISIS Omar Faraj Saeed Al Hardan – Iraq – supported foreign terror cells and ISIS Fazliddin Kurbanov – Uzbekistan – supported foreign terror cells and ISIS Ali Omar – Kenya – conspiracy to support ISIS Abdurahman Yasin Daud – Somalia – conspiracy and attempt to provide material support to ISIS Al-Hazmah Mohammed Jawad – Iraq – attempted to fly to Iraq to fight with ISIS Abdinassir Mohamud Ibrahim – Somalia – conspiracy and attempt to provide material support to ISIS Abdullah Ramo Pazara – Syria – left US 11 days after becoming citizen to fight with ISIS. Ramiz Zijad Hodzic – Bosnia – provided ISIS with tactical gear and weapons Sedina Unkic Hodzic – Bosnia – provided material support to ISIS. Liban Haji Mohamed – Somalia – provided material support to ISIS. Ahmed Nasir Taalil Mohamud – Somalia – conspiracy to provide material support to ISIS Issa Doreh – Somalia – conspiracy to provide material support to ISIS Waad Ramadan Alwan – Iraq – conspiring to kill U.S. nationals abroad and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction (explosives) against U.S. nationals abroad. Mohanad Shareef Hammadi – Iraq – conspiring to provide material support to ISIS.

As you can see, the overwhelming majority of that list is comprised of REFUGEES that came to America from one or more of the 7 countries on Trump’s temporary ban list. (Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen)

AND THAT’S JUST THE BEGINNING!

Today, The White House released a document containing the names OF 24 REFUGEES FROM THOSE COUNTRIES WHO HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH TERRORISM!

See the rest of the list via Breitbart.

The Democrats must be feeding them their information. That is Fake News. They are deliberately feeding judges false information.

So DO NOT believe their lies when they say those countries aren’t a threat!

Can you imagine what would be happening if Hillary Clinton were POTUS ?

Watch the mind-blowing video below:"
138,http://ladylibertysnews.com/rosenstein-just-destroyed-james-comey-one-sentence/,ladylibertysnews,ROSENSTEIN Just DESTROYED James Comey With One Sentence,"[""Alen O'Neill""]","Former FBI Director James Comey was slow during the 2016 election campaign to do his job. Last July he stated that he would not seek charges against Hillary Clinton. According to him, her email server issue was simply bad judgment.

Downloading highly classified material to your private email server is “bad judgment?” Seriously, how lame did that sound?

Under pressure from his own agents, he was forced to address the issue directly. However, he shocked the country when he detailed all her crimes but then turned around and made light of them. This proved he was a Hillary boy all along.

So fast forward a few months. Comey was fired by Trump because of a memo that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein released about Comey.

Now we get a picture behind Rosenstein’s thoughts about Comey in a Fox News interview. Rosenstein laid into Comey’s character in trying to sink Trump’s presidency. Apparently, Comey leaked confidential items that were not for public eyes.

As Rosenstein declared:

“We take confidentiality seriously, so when we have memoranda about our ongoing matters, we have an obligation to keep that confidential.”

The former FBI head had broken the law by releasing information that was to be kept secret. A man like that has no business leading a law enforcement agency.

Watch the Rosenstein video.

The host asked Rosenstein if Comey’s friendship to current Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller was of any concern. Remember, Mueller is looking into the Russian affair.

Rosenstein said this:

IF ANY CONFLICT OF INTERESTS ARISE, HE WILL HAVE NO PROBLEM TAKING ACTION AGAINST THEM BOTH!

Democrats wanted Comey to stay on board at the FBI. He was their link to the work going on about the “Russian collusion.” Hillary’s henchman would have continued to be a thorn in the President’s side.

Yes, he had to go. DO you agree?"
139,http://ladylibertysnews.com/muslims-offended-kids-recite-national-anthem-claim-racist-force/,ladylibertysnews,Radical Muslims in Australia OFFENDED That Their Children Have to Sing the National Anthem,['Todd Cooney'],"How intolerant can a group of people get, folks?

If they don’t want to be a part of the country and culture then they should go back to where they came from. This should apply universally to all who chose to migrate.

Wouldn’t it be a novel approach to do a story on what doesn’t offend Muslims? Perhaps we could figure out why they’re risking their lives entering both America and European countries if “western culture” offends them so!

According to the Islamic activist group, Hizb-ut-Tahrir, Australia is enforcing democratic values and a “disputed view” of history which contradicts Islamic beliefs. According to their spokesman, Unthman Badar, “Requiring schoolchildren to sing the national anthem, and the citizenship pledge supporting democratic values, are a part of an oppressive campaign by Australian authorities of ‘forced assimilation’ of the Muslim community.”

Here’s the pledge:

From this time forward, [under God,]

I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,

whose democratic beliefs I share,

whose rights and liberties I respect, and

whose laws I will uphold and obey.

Pretty oppressive, right? If you are graciously accepted into a country and you can’t even say that pledge, is there any chance of assimilating into the culture? Here’s the national anthem:

Australians all let us rejoice,For we are young and free; We’ve golden soil and wealth for toil; Our home is girt by sea; Our land abounds in nature’s gifts Of beauty rich and rare; In history’s page, let every stage Advance Australia Fair. In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia Fair. Beneath our radiant Southern Cross We’ll toil with hearts and hands; To make this Commonwealth of ours Renowned of all the lands; For those who’ve come across the seas We’ve boundless plains to share; With courage let us all combine To Advance Australia Fair. In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia Fair.

Super oppressive lyrics, right?

If a group of radicals cannot assimilate and integrate within a western society, they can go right back where they came from.

Moreover when immigrants and or asylum seekers actually seek entrance into a benevolent host nation, it is with a reasoned understanding that they will adhere to the principles and laws of that host country.

If those seeking entrance cannot abide by those basic principles, they should not be allowed to enter…it’s really that simple.

Watch Hizb-ut-Tahrir spokesman, Unthman Badar, make the case against Muslim school children singing the national anthem. It begins around the 10 minute point.

This is outrageous! Muslims everywhere act like this when they reach a certain percentage of a western nation’s population, because it is all part of the great plan to achieve a global totalitarian theocracy. WQe cannot let them get away with these things!

Either assimilate, or LEAVE.

They are Muslim first, last and always. Geographic boundaries and national laws mean nothing to them. Their only loyalty is to Allah. It’s their faith. The west doesn’t get it because most liberals are faithless.

It irks me that these intolerant groups of radicaks go to a country of their own and then don’t want to be patriotic to that country.. How about you go back where your from!! Next they will demand that Australian’s convert or be beheaded!

It makes me sick that our children were denied the American flag under Obama, and couldn’t pray… but Muslim children can and do.. we are denied Christ but they are not denied Allah during school hours! This is wrong on more than one level! Next they won’t want to learn the country they have invaded history… because its not theirs!

Muslims are nothing but foreign invaders with no intention of loyalty or assimilation into the country they go to.

This what you get with Socialist politician bent on destroying their country.

Do you think that immigrants should adopt the culture of their host nation or be allowed to force changes to suit them?"

But CNN and that gang of cutthroats will not work for “making America great again.” But what communist minded organization would?

But Bill Clinton’s own former advisor said what america always knows. Russia had nothing to do with Trump winning the election. On the contrary. According to Michael Caputo, Clinton’s boy, Russia would have preferred Hillary.

She would have been easy to sway and predict.

Caputo was speaking with Fox News’s Tucker Carlson when he spilled the beans about Russia and Clinton. Caputo categorically stated that his former boss, Bill Clinton, sent him to Russia in 1993. His secret mission was to have an affect on the Russian elections.

As to Russia wanting to tilt the scale to trump’s favor in 2016…no way. Caputo acknowledges that Putin would have preferred Hillary. Donald Trump has too much integrity and would have been a pain in Russia’s derriere.

For too long the government has only been focused on putting people on welfare and then telling them to vote for officials who will keep them on welfare. That’s a prison that won’t allow people to rise up and become something better. We need to focus on empowering the poor, not trapping them on welfare. Remember: if the government says something is free…run for the hills because they’re about to take everything you have.

Show me a city that’s a decaying, poverty stricken trainwreck, and I’ll show you a city that’s been run by Democrats for decades. And spoiler: it’ll be the same city.

The poorest cities in America have at least one thing in common: governance of liberals. Here’s the list.

Detroit, MI (1st on the poverty rate list) hasn’t elected

a Republican mayor since 1961;

Buffalo, NY (2nd) hasn’t elected one since 1954;

Cincinnati, OH (3rd)… since 1984;

Cleveland, OH (4th)… since 1989;

Miami, FL (5th) has never had a Republican Mayor;

St. Louis, MO (6th)…. since 1949;

El Paso, TX (7th) has never had a Republican Mayor;

Milwaukee, WI (8th)… since 1908;

Philadelphia, PA (9th)… since 1952;

Newark, NJ (10th)… since 1907.

And why is that? Because liberal policies may appear to help people in poverty by giving them government handouts, it doesn’t help people get out of poverty. In fact, more often than not, it traps people in a cycle of dependency, removing any incentive for them to better themselves and pull themselves out of poverty. It’s no coincidence that the overwhelming majority of welfare recipients manage to find a job within two weeks of their benefits expiring.

If you want to see what kind of lifestyle liberalism creates, look no further than this recent story reporting by The Patriot Nation.

Norman Bennett is a perfect, albeit alarming, example of the consequences of liberalism. When the government hands out an endless supply of welfare for those too lazy to work but willing to endlessly procreate, thugs like Bennett (who’s an ex-con, btw) have 15 children with 13 different baby mommas. Bennett owes at least $50,000 in child support and has no job. But whether he ever pays up or not (I’m going to say the latter is a lot more likely), his children will all be taken care of, thanks to those of us who work 40+ hours a week, pay our taxes and act responsibly with our money. All of the women Bennett impregnated are receiving child support through the welfare program formerly known as Aid to Dependent Children. Meanwhile, Bennett and the hood rats he slept with have exactly zero motivation to change their ways. Quite the contrary, they have every incentive to continue popping out babies, because they’re not the ones footing the bill. And don’t waste your time feeling sorry for the “poor women” Bennett left high-and-dry. They’re all adults, they knew what they were getting themselves into – there’s 13 of them for goodness sake! Having a child out of wedlock is an easy meal ticket for these sort of women.

Aren’t you happy your tax dollars are going towards funding this? When our Founding Fathers wrote that we had a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, I don’t think that this is what they had in mind.

Liberals will find fault with this premise…but as mentioned, most NORMAL people.

For one grandfather, the call to be prepared and look after loved ones came home to roost. When three lowlifes attempted to rob his family and rape a granddaughter, this man took immediate action.

A perfect example of why our 2nd Amendment rights must stay protected.

The grandfather, 67-year-old Kenneth Byrd, faced the three suspects when they attempted to do a home invasion. The aftermath left Mr. Byrd with a few gunshot wounds (he is in recovery) and one suspect dead.

These three individuals, identified as Jamie Lee Faison (20), Brandon Carver Stephens (28) and Jamar Hawkins (17), entered the Byrd residence late Monday evening claiming to have car problems. One suspect distracted Byrd while the other two pushed on through. That is when they sought to rob the family and seek to harm the 19-yr-old granddaughter.

With quick thinking, Mr. Byrd grabbed his firearm and began to fire upon the three men. In the ensuing fire-fight, Mr. Byrd was able to hit all three suspects before they ran from the premises. They made their escape in the Byrd family Cadillac.

When authorities caught up with the home invaders, one (Faison) was dead and the others wounded.

Byrd’s wife, Judy, and the granddaughter were not harmed according to Robeson County Sheriff Kenneth Sealey.

This story is a perfect reminder why all Americans must continue to be firm about their right to bear arms. Society is not going to play fair and the police cannot be everywhere. The end result would have been much different if not for Byrd’s quick response and judgment.

Our prayers are with Mr. Byrd for a full recovery.

How do you feel about how this turned out? Do you feel our Second Amendment rights are worth the fight to protect?

Description:



It is said that the late-80s sports hero Bo Jackson was the last of the legends that people actually got to tell each other about, as opposed to just saying, here, watch a clip. The internet - and the instant mass distribution of almost any eye-catching video - has changed the world to the point where almost everything is recorded. But why lament times gone by? Let's enjoy our newfound viral-videotaped universe. Here are 5 moments recently captured on video that you have to see to believe. Let's begin!



#5 First monster truck front flip

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqUlSw1uqaw



Ever watched BMX and wondered how they do a front flip on a bike? Seems challenging enough. How about a car? Wow, that's impressive. But earlier this year, driver Lee O' Donnell upped the ante even farther - with an incredible front flip in a gigantic racing truck. Yes, that's a front flip by a monster truck, a 10, 000 pound gorilla of a truck that can crush whole cars. Known as the Mad Scientist and the world's most gifted racer, O' Donnell has spent 20 years wowing audiences at truck and tractor pulls across the USA. But this incredible flip made history and wrote his name in the record books.



#4 Streamer Receives Donation from Player, Immediately Plays Against Them

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLJcGGKVQOs&feature=youtu.be



Whether it’s a paycheck, found in our pant pockets or in the clothes dryer, money makes people happy whenever they see it. Enter Thijs, one of the most famous Hearthstone players on social media. During gameplay, he received a $30 donation from a friend of his, Kolento. Thijs continued to roll video and clicked to enter another fight in the game. But in one of the funniest coincidences in recent gaming history, the player chosen as his opponent was none other than he who had just donated the money, Kolento.



#3 Guy Hits Two Cars, Flies and Lives

https://www.reddit.com/r/nevertellmetheodds/comments/64n17l/after_this_and_alive/



Some people just won't die. We don't know if they're lucky, hardy or just immortal, but they seem to be guarded by the Gods. On the footage you can see this anonymous man driving a motorcycle very fast. He smashes into a car, flies into the air and lands on another motorist's wind shield. Amazingly, he gets up as if nothing happened at all. One YouTuber suggested that he must be made out of rubber. Another sagely pointed out that the company who made his helmet just got a new voucher, and possibly a new commercial ad.



#2 Insane Basketball Trick Shot

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1Lpl_tVwEM



Many home-grown sports feat videos are clearly manipulated and set up in advance. Or, they person simply tried 100 times and recorded every one until getting the viral video clip they were after. But this man's trick basketball shot seems too astronomically difficult for either of those scenarios to be the case.Lounging on camera and drinking a beer, the man tosses the basketball behind him and is shocked when it bounds off the goal, off the roof of the house, and then finally into the net for a perfect switch. Look at his reaction - that doesn't seem like a doctored video stunt.



#1 Dad Shared Child Abuse With Youtube

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOVrrL5KtsM



In one of the darkest hours in the history of YouTube, a man physically abused his family and filmed the mistreatment to upload on YouTube. First, the father made his children fight and bully one another, with the larger of two boys giving a harsh beating to his other son. Then, bizarrely, he asked his wife to kick HIS butt while the cameras rolled - satisfyingly, she did. But he didn't stop there, eventually smashing their belongings and pulling a real gun on the poor helpless tots. Because there is a merciful God in heaven, YouTube discovered and banned the user, and the sick, demented man mumbled an apology to users in this video before hopefully disappearing from the planet.

173,http://nbc.com.co/suicide-will-affect-aaron-hernandezs-estate-payout/,nbc,How Suicide Will Affect Aaron Hernandez’s Estate Payout,"['Almira Anke', 'Hanif Ibrahim', 'Jacob Morgan']","Aaron Hernandez’s legal troubles have captivated the American public for years, from the beginning of his stardom to his end in a prison cell. The recent discovery of his suicide left many of his victims without the closure they needed. What it also might have done was to exonerate him from the guilt of his actions. Due to his untimely death, he stands the chance of having his conviction for the murder of Odin Lloyd vacated. Under Massachusetts law, if someone dies before they are allowed to have a repeal case of their conviction, then the conviction can seek to be vacated.

Hernandez’s suicide not only has implications for his convictions, but it also has repercussions for his estate and who is entitled to it. Hernandez grew up in Bristol, Connecticut and began his career playing football for the University of Florida. He was considered one of the best tight end players on the field during the three years he played for the New England Patriots. He wasn’t cut from the playing field after his arrest for the death of Odin Lloyd. At the time of the murder Lloyd was dating Hernandez’s fiancee’s sister.

Hernandez was sentenced to life in prison in 2015 after being convicted of first-degree murder in Lloyd’s death. His legal troubles didn’t stop there. There was also mounting evidence that Hernandez was also involved in a drive-by shooting on April 14th, but he was acquitted of those charges. Just five days after being found not guilty, he was found hanging in his cell after apparently committing suicide.

Hernandez’s suicide could have potentially come at just the right time for his legal worries. In the state of Massachusetts, if a defendant doesn’t have their case heard before an appellate court before they die, then lawyers can attempt to have the convictions against them overturned, which is exactly what his attorneys have filed a motion to do. Since Hernandez’s case was not heard before the Supreme Judicial Court before his death, he might just get away with murder.

Prosecutors insist that they will fight the vacating of the convictions, but it is not likely they will win. Whether the conviction stands or not really means nothing to Hernandez himself. Already having fallen from grace, he left a legacy that paints the picture of a very brutal and violent human being. But the convictions being vacated could have a potential impact on many victims’ families’ civil cases.

Although acquitted of the drive-by shootings of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, the victims’ families had filed a wrongful death case against Hernandez. The Lloyd family has also initiated a case against Hernandez’s estate to collect for Lloyd’s death. It’s not just his house and Hummer that are up for grabs; in 2012, Hernandez had signed a contract for $40 million to be paid out over five years, of which he had received approximately $10 million. After he was arrested, the Patriots withheld the remaining money — close to $6 million — and they also took his base amount of over $2.4 million and a sign on bonus of about $3.2 million. Although there are no official reports about how much Hernandez’s legal defense cost, there is likely some money to recover for the victim’s families.

According to lawyers Queens NY, his house is also estimated to be worth somewhere around $1.3 million, and his other assets may also be up for grabs if the families can recover. But there is speculation about how his suicide may affect their ability to collect from his estate, and if his conviction is vacated, what does that mean for his victim’s family? Because Lloyd’s case has already been proven, there is little doubt that the family will not be able to recoup.

But when it comes to the Furtado and De Abreu families, much less proof is needed in a wrongful death suit, but without Hernandez around to defend himself, the whole situation could become very complex. From stardom to bottoming out, Hernandez’s fall from grace was of his own doing.It’s likely the people who will suffer most are those who lost loved family members. Even if they can win their wrongful death suits, they still won’t win back their loved ones."

175,http://nbc.com.co/lifeguards-lose-protection-personal-injury-liability/,nbc,Lifeguards Lose Their Protection Against Personal Injury Liability,"['Almira Anke', 'Hanif Ibrahim', 'Jacob Morgan']","The 1980s sitcom phenomenon “Baywatch” was about a bunch of lifeguards in skimpy suits running around saving people at the beach. There is nothing lighthearted about what lifeguards do, however — especially on beaches where there are turbulent waves or riptides and people who aren’t aware of the danger dive right in. Although lifeguards are typically trained by the Red Cross, there are many situations that can happen with disastrous endings.

There used to be laws in place that protected a lifeguard from prosecution if things didn’t go right, but Hawaiian legislators are considering removing those protections, opening lifeguards up to potentially be sued. The Maui County and Makena State Beach Park lifeguards are in real danger of being vulnerable to personal injury lawsuits if the state legislator doesn’t extend the laws that have been in place for over 15 years to protect lifeguards from legal action.

On June 30th of this year, if actions aren’t taken to prolong a bill and make it permanent, then area lifeguards will be open to liability when people get hurt. A bill set to extend the limited immunity liability has already made it through the Senate; the House has all but gutted it, though, and might just allow the current measures in place to expire. The House bill is going to return to the Senate, and then both chambers will need to reach an agreement about how to resolve the many differences that they are proposing.

The House bill varies from the Senate version because it requires that the personal injury attorney Tampa, is required to defend any civil case that is based on negligence, omission, or a wrongful act at the hands of a lifeguard at designated state beach parks. Both counties are looking for the same thing: protection for their workers. They know that being a lifeguard isn’t an easy job; it’s a very dangerous job, and without protection an individual can potentially face both harm to themselves, and now liability.

If the measure is not extended and the lifeguards aren’t provided the protection they need, then both communities insist that they won’t be able to provide lifeguard services at beach parks as a community resource. People will have to be left to their own devices to protect themselves in the ocean, which is a scarier proposition than just extending the liability clause.

The Senate Bill 562 was set to make the allowance against liability a permanent one, which has been in place since it was first drafted in 2002. A revised bill was to go through both the Senate and the House, and its aim was to make the law’s liability protection extend another four years. It shielded lifeguards from any personal injury liability unless there was found to be any act of omission or wanton or gross negligence in the lifeguard’s actions.

One of the chief lawyers lobbying against Bill 562 is Bob Toyofuku, who is part of the Hawaii Association for Justice, an organization that is a champion for Hawaii’s personal injury lawyers. They maintain that giving a lifeguard an additional pass that other workers aren’t afforded just isn’t reasonable. They should be held accountable as any other employee would be in the case where they perpetrated an act that ended in a personal injury to someone.

The Tort Claims Acts was initiated to treat lifeguards on any state beach as state employees, and guarantees the right to be defended against any lawsuits made against the county. Although Toyofuku insists that he would support amendments made to the current laws, he doesn’t believe that any lifeguard who acts negligently should be free and clear from prosecution. He believes that it sets the precedent for the public to be less safe when under the “watchful” eye of lifeguards.

The facts are that the measure already doesn’t protect lifeguards from personal liability if there is gross negligence on behalf of the employee. The additional protection that they are free from prosecution when they have done everything within their power is necessary. Without those allowances, it is unlikely that any employee would perform such a dangerous job and put themselves in a high-liability position, and this could leave the Hawaiian state beaches unprotected going forward."

Dr. Jimmy Rustling Has Won Many Awards For Excellence In Writing Including Fourteen Peabody Awards', 'A Handful Of Pulitzer Prizes. When Jimmies Are Not Being Rustled The Kind Dr. Enjoys Being An Amazing Husband To His Beautiful', 'Soulmate', 'Anastasia']","Hollywood, CA — Breaking Bad fans around the world are celebrating the stunning, glorious and amazing news announced today: Walter White is not dead, and there will indeed be a sixth season of the wildly-popular, award-winning AMC drama.

This shocking and exciting news comes not from an internet message board or the rumor mill but from series creator Vince Gilligan. In an exclusive CNN interview late Thursday evening, Gilligan dropped the bombshell.

“Walter White is not dead, and neither is Breaking Bad,” said the 47-year-old writer, director, and executive producer of the groundbreaking show.

“We’ve kept it under wraps for months, now the cat’s out of the bag. Season 6 is coming, and it’s going to be epic and true to the fans that have followed the show so incessantly.”







Gilligan explained his decision to continue with the popular series.

“I just couldn’t walk away from it. This isn’t a cash-grab or a sophomoric attempt to bastardize what was such a beautiful ending to season 5. I’ve invested so much of myself in these characters that I’d always had an inkling I’d return to it, even outside [the] Better Call Saul [spinoff]. The kicker was I’d need a spark, something that made it make sense for these stories to continue.”

The series star Bryan Cranston seemed to drop a major hint in an interview with CNN’s Ashleigh Banfield back in May. Asked by Banfield if his character, Walter White, died or not, Cranston said, “Hey, you never saw bags zip up or anything. Or say … you know.”

In response to questions about whether the character could show up in a movie or anywhere else ever again, Cranston said: “Never say never.”

Gilligan explained how the decision came about to do a season six.

“Bryan [Cranston] called me up last year and said he had this incredibly lucid dream in which Walt wakes up in a hospital bed surrounded by the DEA, ends up breaking out of prison and finds out he’s got fans,” Gilligan said. “This isn’t a redemption story, it’s got a bleak, dark premise. I can’t give away any more of the details, but let’s just say Walt has quite a bit of unfinished business to attend to, and it sure as hell has nothing to do with teaching high school science.”

According to Gilligan, the entire cast has principally agreed to return for at least one more season. This includes Bob Odenkirk, star of ‘Better Call Saul’, the prequel comedy series which just finished season one over at AMC.

“I’m not surprised in the least that Vince is going back to Breaking Bad,” said Odenkirk. “I’ve been working with him on set for a long time, and the last few times I’ve seen him, he’s had sort of a glint in his eye, a bounce to his step. He’s laughing at a bunch of jokes I couldn’t pull off two years ago. I mean, comedy and drama can be radically different, and no one does drama like Vince. I’m completely on board.”







Paul Horner, a Breaking Bad writer since season one, upon hearing the announcement by Gilligan confirmed the news with MSNBC.

“Yes, it’s true. You don’t know how much of a relief this is to finally get this off my back. I’ve been keeping this a secret for two long months now, I was ready to explode,” he said. “Here’s a little spoiler for all you fans out there so stop reading right now if you don’t want any information, otherwise, lets go. Season six begins with Walt waking up in the hospital, handcuffed to his bed. Like Bryan [Cranston] said last May, nobody ever saw a body bag, so essentially, the last episode of Season 5 was left open-ended. Skyler, Walt Jr., Marie… none of them have any idea he’s survived, but the DEA is right on top of it. We’ll go through the motions of people finding out he’s alive – many people wanted Walt dead, so there’s a lot of disconcerted, angry people out there. We have Walt going to trial, his incarceration and how he’s keeping Heisenberg and the blue meth on the streets during his imprisonment. Season 6 will have Walt’s eventual breakout, despite the fact that he’s being held prisoner in a fashion not seen since Hannibal Lecter. The nationwide manhunt for Jesse Pinkman is both epic and gripping, and I can tell you for certain his relationship with Walt will continue, in a much more strained, arch-nemesis-type fashion. None of this is anything you won’t find out about in the trailer, but it’s high time to get truly, truly excited for the greatest show of all time! I believe in this, it’s a valid and worthwhile continuation of something that deserves discernment and care. Breaking Bad Season 6! It’s not over yet!”

The original series won multiple awards, including ten Primetime Emmys. Out of 267 nominations, Breaking Bad has garnered 101 trophies. Shooting for Breaking Bad: Season 6 is scheduled to begin August, 2015.

177,http://nbc.com.co/best-places-find-free-roulette-game-web/,nbc,Best Places to Find A Free Roulette Game in the Web,"['Almira Anke', 'Hanif Ibrahim', 'Jacob Morgan']","If you want to learn something, your best friend is almost always the internet. You can discover tons of great stuff on the web. If you have an interest in a free roulette game, a quick search in any search engine will lead you to a site that offers the same. See the best free online roulette game for fun here, which is not run by a casino.

With an overwhelming amount of responses on the web, you might feel confused on where to find the best simulators for roulette. Here are some of the potential places where you can play free games.

Casino Sites

These sites are the first ones that appear when you do a quick search for free games for roulette. ItÆs pretty much understandable why. Many online casinos try to attract new players. By offering free games on top of their sign up bonus and more freebies, casino offers are quite irresistible. At least it is for the average player.

Most of these sites use cookies which are standard for most sites. There are cases where you would need to be a member of the site. The application process is quite easy, though, itÆs just signing up with your name and specific details.

When you sign up and try the roulette games in these casinos, you will get a walkthrough on how the site works. ItÆs basically a free trial of the packages that the site offers.

While this may seem to be an awesome way to play roulette for free, it could give you false hopes. Many players who tried their luck on these games always ended up winning. Hence, thereÆs a theory that free trials in online casinos always allow players to win.

If you have tried something and you are getting confident that youÆve had the best roulette strategy figured out, you are bound to be more uninhibited. This means that you are more likely to bet big money on roulette. When this happens, casinos can take back your luck. You can lose your winnings in one swoop.

Sites for Roulette Newbies

When you are new to roulette or you want to know how it works, your most logical destination is the site for beginners. These sites outline the rules and give tips to players who are new to the game.

Since the best way to learn is to experience the game on your own, there are newbie sites that have roulette simulators. You can try to explore these roulette games to be familiar with how things work.

There would certainly be explanations and illustrations about the wheel and how the croupier would manage the game.

Tech Sites

There are many tech sites where you can find a wide array of computer software. Sites like CNET are a good place to find games including roulette simulators.

One good thing about these sites is that they have a review of the software, at least most of the time. People can also leave comments about a particular program so others will be aware whether it works or not and why.

Gaming Sites

These days, roulette is not just for people who are looking to make quick money in online casinos. It is also becoming a pastime just like Solitaire. Hence, gaming sites already picked it up and there are several flash games that simulate roulette.

You can scan numerous roulette types. You can even choose between American roulette and European roulette in these sites. You have several choices, so you can take your pick based on the site you liked best.

Gaming Forums

Peer to peer interaction is among the best things about the internet. When it comes to finding a free roulette game, you can ask for assistance from other people. You can even find experts who know the ins and outs of the field in a forum. You can also consider this popular casino gambling forum which has its own roulette game

The best thing about forums is that there are real users who can share their thoughts. So, it would be easier to find the simulator that would replicate what happens on a real wheel. Since many of these people play roulette more often than you do, they can provide better advice.

Roulette Strategy Sites

This is another mine for those who are looking for a free roulette game that mimics the workings of a real wheel. Some sites that are dedicated to roulette strategies can help you find a system where you can try the system.

However, you need to make sure that the wheels are not rigged to make you win and appear that you have a winning technique in your hands. There are sites offering their secret strategy that milk people out of money by forcing them to pay a certain amount.

According to Fox News, that is the question being asked by London residents and police today as Murray saved the life of a 9-year-old girl from certain death after he pushed her out of the way at the last second of a semi-truck that was barreling down on the young girl at full speed.

36-year-old Paul Horner, who is in London on business, witnessed the near fatal accident, and told the BBC News about what he saw.

“Yeah, it was horrifying. I saw this little girl standing in the middle of road on her phone and this truck was just going full speed, right towards this poor girl. Then out of nowhere this man pushed her out of the way at the last second saving her life,” Horner said. “So I ran over to them to see if they were alright and to my amazement I see that the girl was perfectly fine and the guy who saved her was none other than Bill Murray! It was Bill frickin’ Murray who saved this kids life!” Horner continued, “That guy is always doing something awesome whether it’s making any movie he wants to be in, playing golf with the pros, crashing random parties, bartending with RZA and GZA from the Wu Tang Clan, eating french fries off the tables of random people or saving lives! He’s everywhere!”

9-year-old Courtney Groves from Bristol, England told reporters about her near death experience.

“I was just playing Zombie Playground, it’s like my favorite game, and wasn’t paying attention to the cars around me. Thank you Mr. Murray for saving my life today,” Groves said. “He even sat down with me and helped me finish the level I was playing. We got a perfect score! He told me that he was in a movie years ago about a zombie, just like my game! I didn’t know what he was talking about but Bill Murray liked my game and he saved my life so I thought that was really neat!”







Murray spoke briefly to reporters about the incident.

“I’m no hero, I was just in the right place at the right time. I think anyone else in my position would have done the same,” Murray said. “Courtney is a great kid. We talked for a while. She even let me play her game on her phone. I told her the next time you wanna play video games, don’t do it in the middle of traffic.”

25-year-old Brian Barth who is a game developer on the Zombie Playground™ team told CNN that he is thrilled the child was not injured.

“It’s an amazing thing that Bill Murray was there to save her life.” Barth said. “It feels really good when someone plays a game you helped create, had a hand in developing; it’s just not a game meant to be played in the middle of traffic, that’s for sure, well unless Bill Murray is there,” Barth laughs.

Boris Johnson who is the Mayor of London told reporters how proud he is to have Murray currently in his city.

“This is a day for everyone in London to celebrate Bill Murray,” Johnson said. “Most blokes would have just stood there like an arse and let that poor girl get run over, but not Mr. Murray. So it is decided, for his bravery we are throwing him a parade and awarding him a key to the city. Today is Bill Murray day in London!”

Murray was in London visiting friends and sightseeing when this near-tragic event took place. Murray says he plans to stay in London for another week and then is off to Japan to finish up work on a new project. Police believe alcohol was a factor in this near-fatal car accident."

When Jimmies Are Not Being Rustled The Kind Dr. Enjoys Being An Amazing Husband To His Beautiful', 'Soulmate', 'Anastasia']","WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — Today President Donald Trump said that he would be adding homes to the entire wall that will run along the U.S. border and Mexico exclusively made for American war veterans.

“We’re gonna build the wall, and we’re gonna make it so great, the best ever, a perfect place for our heroes to live, our amazing veterans, 4 story buildings all across that 2,000 miles of land, you’re gonna love it,” Trump told reporters. “We’ll be able to house up to 250 war veterans ever mile and because of how many miles my wall is gonna be, that’s up to 500,000 war veterans that we’ll be able to house right there on the American and U.S. border. I promise you, no veteran in America will ever have to worry about having a roof over their head ever again.”

The U.S. border with Mexico is roughly 2,000 miles long and underlines four states, from California to Texas, more than half of it along the Colorado River and Rio Grande.

Senate leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, said Congress will follow through on Trump’s border wall order, and McConnell estimated it will cost $15 billion at most — he cited a range of $12 billion to $15 billion. With the homes for war veterans, there will be an added cost of $5 billion dollars. But the Trump administration said that, “Mexico will pay for it, so there’s no need for American tax payers to worry.”

On the campaign trail Trump’s immigration reform plan called for impounding remittance payments derived from illegal wages, a controversial idea, and imposing increased visa and entry fees to the United States from Mexico unless the latter agrees to finance the wall. Trump is also pushing border taxes more broadly against trading partners, which could help finance the wall.

Marc Rosenblum, deputy director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute spoke to reporters about the current wall in place.

“The first miles of fencing were in the easiest places,” said Rosenblum. “There were fencing areas in or close to cities and accessible transportation, rather than deep in deserts or mountains. Additionally, the first miles were on public lands, while completing a border wall would require the government to acquire land from private holders and Indian Reservations. The GAO estimate for one difficult section of fencing near San Diego was $16 million.”

President Trump, speaking last year on the campaign trail spoke about the wall at almost every rally.

“I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I’ll build them very inexpensively — I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.”

Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward , a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to CNN about Trump’s decision.

“This is a story about Donald Trump making his wall out of homes for war veterans that will run along the U.S. and Mexico border.” Bradley said. “I just want to say a big thanks to everyone that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless, it means so much. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps .”

Trump tweeted today saying:

“Great news everyone! We’re gonna build the wall out of homes for our amazing war veterans! They’ll never have to worry about housing again!”

Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told CNN he believes what Trump is doing is the right thing.

“A wall made out of homes for our veterans is a great idea. When Mexico invades us, I know we’ll be ready, thanks to our American veterans that will be protecting us at the border. Also, I appreciate Donald Trump and his strong stance on masturbation, he’s doing the Lord’s work. Praise Donald Trump!”

The Trump Administration has set up a 24-hour hotline to address any questions and concerns the public may have regarding the wall being made out of homes for American war veterans. The number for that hotline is (785) 273-0325."
182,http://nbc.com.co/horror-movies-themes-online-games-popularity/,nbc,Horror movies themes online games and their popularity,"['Almira Anke', 'Hanif Ibrahim', 'Jacob Morgan']","People are somehow wired to love scary stuff. Not only are horror movies thrilling, but they are fun to watch. That’s the reason why this genre will continue reigning supreme in just the same way it has done over the last couple of decades. This clearly shows that horror movies have an audience, so why not convert some of those movies into slot or board games?

Well, that’s the idea. If you love thrills and chills, then there is something specific for that taste. There is no shortage of online games that are based on movies. And most importantly, we know that these games provide a way to have fun in a safe environment, especially during the Halloween season. But due to the scary nature of certain online games, a certain segment of the population can’t play them. This includes children or people who are below 12 years of age.

Reasons why Royal Vegas online casino will have something in the horror category

Remember when we first got introduced to the Walking Dead season premier. We couldn’t get enough of traveling in a terror-field country of zombies. The most interesting part came as a result of characters fighting for their survival.

The most thrilling part of it is when characters try reaching various objectives only to risk being swallowed alive by the zombies. And even though this is the case, they have to fetch for food, or take care of the sick, make new friends, and keep going until they make it. Of course such an environment is also filled with fast-paced action followed by chills. This is very entertaining especially when put in a game format.

Again, there’s the element of creepiness which makes horror-themed online games a favorite among many gaming enthusiasts. If you look at the 5 top horror movies of the last 10 years, you will most likely come across movies that are based on paranormal activities. This often involves a haunted house and some investigators who are trying to establish the cause of weird activities in that particular house. Not only is this creepy in a game, but it can also kick your adrenaline as some games come with amazing miniatures to thrill you. Even the thought of keeping the lights on during nightfall is enough to send chills down your spine.

Finally, the last category of horror movies are based on blood-sucking creatures named vampires. These movies have since been converted into online games such as Fury of Dracula and so on.

So if you’re playing any of these games at Royal Vegas online casino, be sure to have fun with the challenging goals which must be met. You have to contain your excitement and really focus in order to beat the odds. Above all, Royal Vegas online casino provides value for their offering by rewarding you with bonuses.

Some games will trigger bonuses when certain action is taken by the player. It’s always an element of fun and surprises when playing these games at Royal Vegas online casino. So you should definitely give it a shot if you love this genre."

This guy knows how to work a room; picking out the weakest link and then devouring them with his hard-hitting, extremely uncomfortable, serial-killer-ish, style of humor. Nothing is off limits to Gregory.

I remember being at a party about a year ago with Jonathan. He walked up to me without saying a word. He then proceeded to look me directly in the eyes for what seemed like an eternity, then took his attention off me and gradually looked around the room, eying each person there. Then Gregory turns back to me and in a deep voice slowly says, “Which one would you kill first?”

With his signature black shirt, long hair and menacing facial expressions, this dude is creepy and it all adds to the fun of his act.



Gregory’s comedy, although unique and different, has been well received by a wide variety of audiences. This includes bars, theaters, world-class comedy clubs and even retirement homes. Gregory has over 10 million views on his YouTube page and his television credits include Showtime Boxing, NBC’s Last Comic Standing season 6, and E! Network’s True Hollywood Stories Investigates Hazing.

According to Gregory’s website, he spent over a year on a weekly morning radio program called “Think Tank Tuesday” which was part of the Morning Infidelity on KWSS 106.7FM. There his awkward take on the daily news brought laughter to listeners as they went about their morning commute. Gregory’s stand-up has been featured at the SLO Comedy Festival, Ventura Comedy Festival, the iO West Comedy Festival in Hollywood, Comedy Central’s “Up Next” Contest, Rooftop Comedy, and he was named Arizona’s best comedic writer by judges at the Tempe Improv.

So what is in store next for Jonathan Gregory? Well, I suppose that is the million dollar question. My guess: Prison or Conan."

188,http://nbc.com.co/personal-injury-claims-ford-explorer-rise/,nbc,Personal Injury Claims Against Ford Explorer On The Rise,"['Almira Anke', 'Hanif Ibrahim', 'Jacob Morgan']","What initially seemed like only a disgruntled few has grown into over 650,000 complaints to date against the makers of the 2011-2017 Ford Explorers. The claims are that there is a potential for deadly exhaust leaks and that hundreds of thousands of consumers have been subject to injury due to the faulty design of the Ford Explorer.

Consumers from many walks of life have described what they call “exhaust fumes” coming not from the exterior, but the cabin of their vehicle, and they are questioning what the exposure might be doing to passengers. Anyone who has ever been in a car realizes that being inside one provides very limited space, and if there is something harmful in the air, then everyone is affected to some extent.

To blame, evidently, is the Explorer’s air conditioner and the way that it circulates air while the driver presses the gas pedal. While accelerating, drivers and passengers alike have alleged that there is a very familiar “rotten egg” or “sulfur” smell that permeates the interior. According to experts who have investigated the complaints against the Ford company, the smell has been linked to an unsealed seam in the rear of the SUV.

Over 150 owners have filed lawsuits in court and with the NHTSA, which first launched the investigation to substantiate the claims that exhaust was being leaked into the cabin of the car. Obviously, the biggest concern is the potential exposure of vehicle occupants to carbon monoxide.

The original 150 claims have blossomed into over 450,000, some involving the 2016 models, while others are alleging that 2017 models are also affected. The additional claims have not been a part of the NHTSA’s original investigation into the exhaust allegations.

Ford has been aware of the exhaust issues since as early as 2012. At that point there is a record of the automaker providing bulletins to the dealers that there may, in fact, have been an exhaust problem. In 2015, it was escalated when a Ford Motor representative called it a “design issue,” admitting that there was some truth to the claims being made. The company, however, has not made any attempt to have a formal recall to fix the exhaust problem or to address the concerns of the Ford Explorer owners.

The claims made against the automaker by a personal injury houston attorney state, that while in the vehicle, passengers and drivers have experienced everything from passing out and suddenly crashing into a tree, to injuries such as bronchitis, burning eyes, headaches and childhood breathing issues. In other cars, the exhaust system vents harmful gases such as acrolein benzene, carbon monoxide, acetaldehyde and formaldehyde outside of the car. According to investigators, the defective Ford Explorer was improperly designed to have the vents go directly into the car’s interior.

Carbon monoxide has been linked to many ill health effects, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiovascular disease. If exposure is concentrated enough, it can lead to death. There has not been any conclusive evidence that anyone has been injured due to the defect in the design, which makes a personal injury suit difficult to initiate. But in August of 2016, Ford did agree to settle a class-action suit in Florida. Maybe this is an admission of negligence; many more claims appear to be pending.

Although many factors decide a verdict in a personal injury case including the amount of injury sustained, negligence is the main factor. If Explorer owners can conclusively show that they were exposed to harmful gases as a result of the way that the car was constructed, it might just be enough to charge Ford with personal injury suits, or at a minimum, a massive and expensive recall.

Until there is evidence that it is causing anyone harmful exposure, the claims will probably fall by the wayside. But if Ford settles out of court many more times, then they will be inadvertently admitting guilt and could be opening themselves up for some severe and serious compensatory payoffs at the very least."

Have you ever stopped to ask yourself why that person didn’t put the phone down and call for help o in any way help to stop it? Moreover, did you notice that there were tons of people standing around watching an incident, but no one stepped in?

Although you would assume that someone has a moral obligation to step in to stop violence and crime, the facts are that they have no legal responsibility to do anything. In Michigan, there are no laws that make it illegal to watch a crime being committed and to not take action. Local law enforcement might be disappointed and upset that people don’t feel the need to do anything, but they have no recourse against witnesses who don’t try to help.

It isn’t that getting a video of the incident isn’t a good idea for both the criminal prosecution of the people involved and for any resulting personal injury suits. It is just that the people in the video might be better served if someone put the camera down while someone else is taping, so that they can make a call to end it. We’re a society that has become gladiator spectators, where people seem more concerned with getting the best shot and the most likes on YouTube than they are with assisting fellow neighbors, friends, and strangers who need help.

When Detroit Police Chief James Craig stood in front of the cameras commenting on the latest online video fight, he admitted that although there was no recourse for those who stand by and commit crimes, it is nonetheless an offense. He also talked about an incident where a man and woman were stabbed in a fight, and barely anyone called 911 to report the incident.

Many legislators are looking at the recent incidents and wondering if there is something that they can do to stop the glorification of violence on social media sites. Many believe that the best way to curb increasing violence is to hold people accountable for not only participating in acts, but also to hold them accountable when they don’t at the very least take steps to call 911 for help. Obviously, you can’t force someone to step in and potentially put themselves into harm’s way, but creating legislation to at a minimum call 911 is not an unrealistic measure.

Currently, unless a Criminal lawyer in Boston MA can prove that a person is directly involved in a crime, then there is no potential for them to be held liable. If you are a bystander, and potentially not a very good person for not helping, that still doesn’t make you criminally liable for the actions of someone else.

The problem is that if legislators start to put rules into place about what an individual’s responsibility is to those around them, it could be a slippery slope that leads to people losing their right to freedom of choice. The government can’t legislate morality or tell someone when they have a legal responsibility to step in to help or to intervene. It isn’t reasonable that you could prosecute someone for being an innocent bystander in a crime.

If legislators try to compel people to step in, that could put those who intervene at risk. It isn’t just about physically intervening; it is a safety issue. What if a bystander calls 911 and there are repercussions for them in their community or neighborhood?

If it is a gang-related incident, the last thing that anyone wants to do is to punish someone for putting a video on the internet and not calling — if they failed to call out of fear of reprisal. If Michigan starts to legislate how to behave morally, then there is really no situation that the government can’t try to dictate.

The technicalities of technology and law continue to mount, with everything from cellphones and driving distracted to filming instead of calling law enforcement when someone is in trouble. The fact is that no matter what you think someone should morally do, you can’t legislate being a good person or taking personal responsibility for something that isn’t your problem or that you aren’t even involved in."

When Jimmies Are Not Being Rustled The Kind Dr. Enjoys Being An Amazing Husband To His Beautiful', 'Soulmate', 'Anastasia']","Washington, DC — President Barack Obama shocked the country today with news that he is running for a third term.

“I can’t abandon the American people now when they need me more than ever,” Obama told reporters at a press conference today. “We’ve come this far as a nation, now is not the time to do something different. This is the change you wanted and this is the change you’re getting.”

Presidential hopeful Rand Paul of Kentucky told NBC News he does not agree with Obama and his announcement.

“This defies everything the Constitution stands for,” Paul said. “We cannot let this man have a third term.”

In the history of this country only two presidents have served more than two terms, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin D, Roosevelt. The major problem for Obama when he runs in 2016, is the 22nd Amendment. In short, the 22nd Amendment states, “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice…”







The U.S. Constitution does make an exception in the 22nd Amendment though:

“This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several states within seven years from the date of its submission to the states by the Congress.”

This means Obama’s third term presidential run is only valid if he receives 75% approval from the Congress, though insiders say Obama plans to make an executive order to ratify this.

Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian anti-masturbation organization, told NBC News that the group is thrilled about Obama running for a third term.

“Obama has really done a lot to put pressure on Big Masturbation and I think a third term is exactly what he needs to put an end to masturbation in this country once and for all. I wish him the best of luck!”

Paul Horner, who is a spokesman for the Obama Administration, answered questions from reporters about their campaign strategy to achieve a third term in office.

“Obama is guaranteed to win in 2016. I mean seriously, will it even be close? The Republicans believe the Earth is only 6,000 years old and that Obama is a Muslim; and Hillary Clinton is, well, she’s Hillary Clinton. I don’t even think we’re going to have to campaign, we’ll probably just end up phoning this thing in. I think as long as Obama doesn’t die, he is a lock for President in 2016.”

Dr. Jimmy Rustling Has Won Many Awards For Excellence In Writing Including Fourteen Peabody Awards', 'A Handful Of Pulitzer Prizes. When Jimmies Are Not Being Rustled The Kind Dr. Enjoys Being An Amazing Husband To His Beautiful', 'Soulmate', 'Anastasia']","HOLLYWOOD, CA (AP) — Breaking Bad fans around the world are celebrating the stunning, glorious and amazing news announced today: Walter White is not dead, and there will indeed be a sixth season of the wildly-popular, award-winning AMC drama.

This shocking and exciting news comes not from an internet message board or the rumor mill but from series creator Vince Gilligan. In an exclusive interview with NBC News, Gilligan dropped the bombshell.

“Walter White is not dead, and neither is Breaking Bad,” said the 47-year-old writer, director, and executive producer of the groundbreaking show.

“We’ve kept it under wraps for months, now the cat’s out of the bag. Season 6 is coming, and it’s going to be epic and true to the fans that have followed the show so incessantly.”







Gilligan explained his decision to continue with the popular series.

“I just couldn’t walk away from it. This isn’t a cash-grab or a sophomoric attempt to bastardize what was such a beautiful ending to season 5. I’ve invested so much of myself in these characters that I’d always had an inkling I’d return to it, even outside [the] Better Call Saul [spinoff]. The kicker was I’d need a spark, something that made it make sense for these stories to continue.”

The series star Bryan Cranston seemed to drop a major hint in an interview with CNN’s Ashleigh Banfield back in May. Asked by Banfield if his character, Walter White, died or not, Cranston said, “Hey, you never saw bags zip up or anything. Or say … you know.”

In response to questions about whether the character could show up in a movie or anywhere else ever again, Cranston said: “Never say never.”

Gilligan explained how the decision came about to do a season six.

“Bryan [Cranston] called me up and said he had this incredibly lucid dream in which Walt wakes up in a hospital bed surrounded by the DEA, ends up breaking out of prison and finds out he’s got fans,” Gilligan said. “This isn’t a redemption story, it’s got a bleak, dark premise. I can’t give away any more of the details, but let’s just say Walt has quite a bit of unfinished business to attend to, and it sure as hell has nothing to do with teaching high school science.”

According to Gilligan, the entire cast has principally agreed to return for at least one more season. This includes Bob Odenkirk, star of ‘Better Call Saul’, the prequel comedy series which finished season one over at AMC.

“I’m not surprised in the least that Vince is going back to Breaking Bad,” said Odenkirk. “I’ve been working with him on set for a long time, and the last few times I’ve seen him, he’s had sort of a glint in his eye, a bounce to his step. He’s laughing at a bunch of jokes I couldn’t pull off two years ago. I mean, comedy and drama can be radically different, and no one does drama like Vince. I’m completely on board.”







Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward , a group that gives out donated new socks to the homeless, told NBC News she is excited that Gilligan will be featuring the group in the upcoming season.

“I’m just thrilled that Vine [Gilligan] is using our name and group in season six of Breaking Bad,” Bradley said. “We have so many great scenes and dialogue in season six, it is so fantastic. This will definitely increase the amount of donations we receive and put so many more brand new pairs of socks on the feet of homeless people. Please give what you can, every bit helps so much .”

Paul Horner, a Breaking Bad writer since season one, upon hearing the announcement by Gilligan confirmed the news with NBC News.

“Yes, it’s true. You don’t know how much of a relief this is to finally get this off my back. I’ve been keeping this a secret for two long months now, I was ready to explode,” he said. “Here’s a little spoiler for all you fans out there so stop reading right now if you don’t want any information, otherwise, lets go. Season six begins with Walt waking up in the hospital, handcuffed to his bed. Like Bryan [Cranston] said last May, nobody ever saw a body bag, so essentially, the last episode of Season 5 was left open-ended. Skyler, Walt Jr., Marie… none of them have any idea he’s survived, but the DEA is right on top of it. We’ll go through the motions of people finding out he’s alive – many people wanted Walt dead, so there’s a lot of disconcerted, angry people out there. We have Walt going to trial, his incarceration and how he’s keeping Heisenberg and the blue meth on the streets during his imprisonment. Season 6 will have Walt’s eventual breakout, despite the fact that he’s being held prisoner in a fashion not seen since Hannibal Lecter. The nationwide manhunt for Jesse Pinkman is both epic and gripping, and I can tell you for certain his relationship with Walt will continue, in a much more strained, arch-nemesis-type fashion. None of this is anything you won’t find out about in the trailer, but it’s high time to get truly, truly excited for the greatest show of all time! I believe in this, it’s a valid and worthwhile continuation of something that deserves discernment and care. Breaking Bad Season 6! It’s not over yet!”

For comedic relief in season 6, a Christian anti-masturbation organization’s mascot named Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin will be joining the crew. Fappy, played by newcomer 36-year-old Paul Horner from Phoenix, Arizona, told NBC News he is excited about the role.

“I’m not familiar with the show, honestly if it’s not in the Bible I probably haven’t heard about it,” Horner said. “A couple months ago, the great Lonnie Childs, president of Stop Masturbation Now, contacted me and asked if I wanted to be in one of those moving picture shows about breaking stuff badly and smoking methamphetamine. I told him I had never tried meth before, but had heard good things. I also told him I was interested in the part, but just as long as the breaking show had no self-rape or homogayness in it. He assured me it didn’t, so I said, sure, why not!” Horner continued, “I think this is a perfect platform to help spread awareness about the dangers and consequences of masturbation. This is going to be so much fun! Praise Lonnie Childs! Praise Fappy!”

The original series won multiple awards, including ten Primetime Emmys. Out of 267 nominations, Breaking Bad has garnered 101 trophies. Shooting for Breaking Bad: Season 6 is scheduled to begin December, 2015.

198,http://nbc.com.co/hate-crimes-rise-since-trump-took-office/,nbc,Are Hate Crimes On The Rise Since Trump Took Office?,"['Almira Anke', 'Hanif Ibrahim', 'Jacob Morgan']","Whether you are in favor of or against the Trump Administration and its policies, there aren’t many who don’t have an opinion. Due to current events both in America and abroad, some insist that an anti-Muslim sentiment is fostered and is only enhanced by Trump’s attempt at an immigration ban from countries which are predominantly Muslim. The recent Portland stabbing incident is only further making people wonder whether hate crimes are getting worse in America.

Last Friday, Destinee Mangum and her Muslim friend, who was wearing a hijab — the traditional Muslim head covering, — were riding on a train and minding their own business. Joseph Christian, a 35-year-old Portland native, began yelling racial slurs at the two young girls. The girls fled the area, afraid that things would escalate. Christian was quite incensed and using ethnic slurs against not just Muslims but other religions and ethnicities, according to the girls and corroborated by the other train passengers.

Bystanders on the train began to step in to defend the two girls, and what happened was something that no one saw coming. Christian began stabbing the people who were asking him to stop his verbal assault. Ricky John Best, a retired military professional, and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche were two men that died as a result of the altercation that ensued. A third victim, 21-year-old Micah Fletcher, was also severely injured.

Dyjuana Hudson, Mangum’s mother, officially sent out a statement thanking those who protected her daughter that day. After the stabbings, Christian was chased by several eyewitnesses and was caught by law enforcement. He has been charged with attempted murder and two counts of aggravated murder. It hasn’t been announced yet whether prosecutors will seek hate crime charges against him. Apparently, this was not the first time that Christian went on a tirade on the same train. Reports say that he had done it the day before, but no one stepped in.

After his arrest, his Facebook account painted a picture of a man who was a member of just about every racist organization that he could find. Compounding the tragedy, the incident happened right at the beginning of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month. Although Trump condemned the act, many believe that it is the Trump Administration that is increasing the incidents of bigoted acts across the nation. Some political pundits would suggest that Trump has sent out Islamophobic, anti-immigration and racist Tweets, and they are only perpetuating the increase in hate crimes.

It isn’t just the Portland attack that is concerning many; there was also an incident at the University of Maryland involving the stabbing of African-American students by other (white) students, mosques have reportedly been burned down, and there have been drive-by shootings in Tulsa related to an LGBTQ organization.

So are hate crimes on the rise?

It is hard to discern, because there simply isn’t enough data tracked related to the number of hate crimes across the nation. What a criminal lawyer in Dallas has noticed is that there does seem to be, is a rise in anti-Muslim hate crimes in America over the past couple of years.

According to the latest statistics, the Federal Bureau of Investigation found that there was a reported 7% rise in hate crimes in 2015 alone, with a 67% increase in hate crimes that were reported by Muslims. The problem is that unless they are successfully prosecuted, hate crimes are nothing more than subjective. Until better statistics are kept and analyzed, the presumption that they are on the rise is only conjecture.

There is no doubt that anti-Muslim fear is on the rise, but whether it is resulting in more hate crimes is debatable. It is difficult to watch all the violence around the globe traced back to Muslims and not be a little concerned when you see traditional Muslim dress. It is also not clear if the increase has anything to do with the Trump Administration. It is likely a result of what is going on globally."
199,http://nbc.com.co/push-cap-damages-medical-malpractice-horizon/,nbc,Push To Cap Damages For Medical Malpractice On Horizon,"['Almira Anke', 'Hanif Ibrahim', 'Jacob Morgan']","Big changes may be on the horizon for the state of medicine in America. Changes to Obamacare have just been proposed that would take away the tax imposition for those who don’t carry health insurance. Just one of the three-part changes promised by the Trump Administration, the health insurance industry is not the only healthcare system that will likely be challenged and altered over the next several years. Another possible change is a push to cap damages awarded by the courts for medical malpractice.

Insurance costs for physicians have skyrocketed over the past several decades. Doctors are increasingly worried about the decisions they make, due to the risk of being sued for malpractice. Being guided by lawsuits, however, might not be doing the patients any favors. Legislation is slated to hit the House Committee that would make it harder for patients to be awarded large sums of money due to malpractice.

Already approved by the House Judiciary Committee, the new legislation would put a cap on the damages allowed for victims of malpractice. The measure would include nursing homes, hospitals and physicians alike. Many states already have caps in place for recovering for malpractice. The legislation would encompass patients on Medicaid, Veterans or Military Health recipients, Medicare and those who are covered under the Affordable Care Act, along with those who either have health saving plans or COBRA for their health insurance coverage.

Leading the charge is Iowa Representative Steve King (R). He believes the medical profession should use malpractice suits to prevent further mistakes in the healthcare industry.

Like many other issues in the US, malpractice caps appear to fall along political lines. Democrats are enraged by the proposed cap on damages. Representatives like Ted Deutch believe that the legal system should work to compensate those who are injured, not be used for teaching purposes.

Obviously, those who are lobbying for the medical industry and medical professionals are delighted about the legislation and would love to see a cap in place. A legal malpractice attorney Atlanta, believe that many malpractice awards are out of control and not comparable to the damages that result. They also believe that the high awards negatively impact the health care that people receive and lead to decisions based more on fear of litigation than on common-sense medicine.

What has really incensed the Democrats who voted against the cap measure is that only specific insurance coverage has been singled out to cap awards. For those who can afford private insurance, it appears that there is no limit to their damage recovery. That unfairly disadvantages veterans and those who are dependent upon state-run health care programs, which creates a systematic bias in medical malpractice litigation.

Also at issue is the rapid movement of the bill’s passage. The bill has been up for review numerous times over the course of the past several decades and has always been voted down. The expeditiousness of the bill this time around is likely due to the Republican predominance in both houses.

Many believe the bill will not only shield doctors from medical mistakes, but also cover pharmaceutical companies for personal injury suits. It will also put caps on the damages that pharmaceutical companies are compelled to pay when someone is injured. That could lead to dangerous drugs being allowed in the marketplace far longer than they should be.

It might also give immunity to drug companies when patients are harmed by FDA-approved drugs, which could mean that many who are injured by mass-produced medicines would not be eligible to receive fair compensation.

Although it doesn’t put a cap on recovery for economic damages, the bill would top out the amount that patients are entitled to for their pain and suffering to a maximum of $250,000. Many legislators believe that will unfairly disadvantage children and the elderly. Since those two populations would suffer minimal economic damages, they would be disproportionately awarded less for their malpractice suits.

Putting a cap on what patients of malpractice can be granted, especially according to their insurance coverage, might be doing the least-served populations a disservice and further put them at an economic advantage. Many lawmakers wonder who is winning more: the drug companies or healthcare companies who have been lobbying for this type of measure for decades."
200,http://yournewswire.com/john-kerry-calls-for-russia-and-syria-war-crimes-investigation/,newsbbc,John Kerry Calls For Russia And Syria War Crimes Investigation,['Black Swan'],"The US secretary of state John Kerry has called for Russia and Syria to face “war crimes” investigations for bombing of civilian targets.

“Russia, and the regime, owe the world more than an explanation about why they keep hitting hospitals and medical facilities and children,” he said.

Kerry also claimed that Syrian forces hit “another hospital” in Aleppo overnight, killing 20 people and wounding 100. There has been no confirmation of the attack from either government or rebel sources.

#SYRIA: @JohnKerry says regime strike last night on Syria hospital killed 20 people, wounded 100+, but SOHR says it has no record of attack — Maya Gebeily (@GebeilyM) October 7, 2016

He said Russian and Syrian government attacks on hospitals were “beyond the accidental” and part of a deliberate strategy in war-torn Syria.

“This is a targeted strategy to terrorise civilians and to kill anybody and everybody who is in the way of their military objective”.

RT reports:

Syrian jets, backed by the Russian air force, are targeting militants in East Aleppo after jihadist groups in control of the enclave there repeatedly violated the cessation of hostilities, according to Moscow and Damascus.

UN estimates put the number of militants in East Aleppo between six and eight thousand, said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, about half of whom belong to the terrorist organization Al-Nusra Front. Russia is prepared to urge the Syrian government to let them depart the city, Lavrov added.

UN’s envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, personally offered to escort the militants out.

“If you [Al-Nusra] did decide to leave, in dignity with your weapons, to Idlib or anywhere you wanted to go, I personally am ready, physically ready, to accompany you,” he said on Thursday.

Kerry’s words were an attempt to distract from Washington’s failure to implement the Syrian ceasefire, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Friday.

“Kerry’s statement – this is propaganda. There are some very serious legal consequences behind this terminology, and I think that Kerry used all of these terms to inflame the situation,” Zakharova said.

“If it comes to war crimes, US representatives should start with Iraq. And then move to Libya, and of course to Yemen – find out what’s there. I want to say that juggling these words is very dangerous, because there are indeed war crimes on the part of the American representatives,” Zakharova told Dozhd TV.

Washington suspended bilateral contacts with Russia over the Syrian crisis on Monday, accusing Moscow of not doing enough to restrain the government in Damascus. The Foreign Ministry in Moscow said that Russia had made every effort to preserve the September 9 ceasefire agreement, while repeatedly urging Washington to live up to its obligations and separate the so-called “moderate opposition” fighters from Al-Nusra and other terrorists.

Kerry’s remarks come as the Syrian Army made advances in the Sheikh Saeed district of Aleppo, on the southern side of the rebel-held enclave. Even as government bombardment has lessened, shelling from the rebel side killed 11 people in the government-held Al-Jamaliyeh neighborhood on Thursday.

Authorities in Damascus have said “there is no other option” but to continue to fight the rebels until they leave Aleppo."
201,http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/what-is-a-raw-vegan-diet/?a_aid=54e3fadc2316d,newsbbc,What Is a Raw Vegan Diet?,['L. A. Mcdonough'],"When developing a raw vegan diet, or any diet for that matter, you should focus on choosing foods that provide your body with the five most essential types of nutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, fats, minerals, and vitamins. Fortunately, these essential nutrients are present in a wide range of fruits, vegetables, herbs, and plants, so it is actually pretty easy to create a diet for yourself that is highly varied, palatable, and rich in nutritious value. Additionally, consuming these foods in raw form adds additional vitality and enzymes to your body because cooking removes many essential nutrients from foods. Organic, raw foods are also free from many of the preservatives that are added to foods that are intended for traditional recipe cooking.

Carbohydrates for Vegans

Carbohydrates are the first nutrient group to mention and raw, leafy green vegetables are the best source of complex carbohydrates for vegans. Complex carbohydrates take longer to break down and enter your blood stream. This allows the body to absorb them slowly and to use them more efficiently. Legumes are another excellent source of complex carbohydrates that also help maintain constant, healthy blood sugar levels.

Protein for Vegans

Although meat is usually thought to be the primary (or only) source of protein, incorporating protein into a raw vegan diet isn’t nearly as difficult as you may think. Protein is much more abundant in plant material than people have been raised to believe. Our civilization and the advertising wizards who pull the strings have promoted a myth that a plant-based diet is unable to deliver all of the protein a person requires. This is not based on fact, but rather, on a desire to promote meat as a food source for economic gain. In actuality, protein is abundant in many types of vegetable sprouts. Broccoli sprouts, for instance, contain 35% protein, while pea sprouts contain 25% protein.

Many of the same leafy green vegetables from which we gain complex carbohydrates also provide us with protein. Broccoli and kale both consist of 45% protein, while spinach consists of 30 percent protein. Eating these vegetables this will also enrich your body with essential minerals, vitamins, and amino acids which we will examine more closely in a moment.

Nuts and seeds are two fabulous sources of protein for the raw vegan diet. Seeds make excellent, filling snacks between meals and are also a source for the essential fats required by the human body. Almonds are 12% protein per ounce. Pumpkin seeds consist of 21% protein per seed, while hemp seeds consist of 22% protein. A lesser known food source, but protein rich at the same time, is Spirulina, a type of algae. It is almost 68% protein—more than any land-based plant life. It also contains fatty acids and appears to have detoxification qualities as well. Another algae, Chlorella, is 60% protein and also possesses certain tissue repair properties.

Fats for Vegans

There’s no harm in avoiding unhealthy saturated fats but certain types of healthy fats are necessary for a healthy raw vegan diet. These fats can be obtained from many of the nuts and seeds mentioned previously. You can also get them from organic, raw avocados, and milk substitutes made from nuts and oily seeds. Hemp milk and almond milk, for instance, are two of the healthiest dairy substitutes that anyone can consume, vegan or otherwise. Avocados should be consumed independently from sweet and starchy foods in order to prevent the body from craving excessive amounts of sugar.

Minerals for Vegans

It is also necessary to make sure that your raw vegan diet contains plenty of essential minerals. The most important of these minerals is calcium, followed by iron, magnesium, and a host of others. The following lists is a handy reference chart of plant sources for each type of mineral the body requires.

202,http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-06/leaked-memo-confirms-hillary-was-given-questions-ahead-interview,newsbbc,Leaked Memo Confirms Hillary Was Given Questions Ahead Of Interview,"['Chris Dakota', 'Not Verified', 'Lance-A-Lot', 'Main_Sequence']","Yesterday, in the latest indication that few things involving Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign are left to chance, we reported that Brennan Leach, a child actor and daughter of a PA Democratic Senator, was used to ask staged questions at a recent Hillary town hall. And while there has been some unconfirmed speculation that the Democratic presidential candidate may have colluded with Lester Holt during her first presidential debate, we now have further proof that ""preparation"" for Hillary means being fully informed of what is about to take place well ahead of time.

According to a leaked memo obtained by the Washington Free Beacon, the Clinton campaign was sent all questions one week by the program before the interview between Clinton and Harvey on Feb. 17. The memo was sent by campaign spokeswoman Karen Finney, formerly an MSNBC host, and communications staffer Betsaida Alcantara. In it the Clinton aides wrote one week before the taping that ""Steve is known to be a host who goes out of his way to make his guests feel comfortable. We coordinated closely with the show’s producers on the script and format of the show.”

The memo was attached to an email posted on the website DCLeaks.com. According to the Free Beacon, one of the individuals behind the website - which has been alleged of working with the Russian government - provided the website with a password to access that email and others sent to and from Clinton volunteer Beanca Nicholson, who was doing advance work for a campaign swing through Chicago that included the Harvey interview.

According to the memo, Clinton’s staff saw Harvey’s show as an effective and low-risk way to reach out to female and African American voters. They also noted recent episodes of the show that focused on issues that Clinton had stressed during her campaign. ""Clinton’s staff pitched the show on some of those issues, including gun control, and noted that Harvey would not likely force Clinton to go into detail defending her positions"" the WFB notes.

Questions included were about Clinton’s granddaughter, the former secretary of State's pizza preferences (thin crust versus deep dish) and her support of gun control policies.

""Please note that the tone of the show is generally light so even on policy questions, Steve won’t go too deep into details,” the memo read.

The campaign and the Harvey's producers also coordinated on which parts of Clinton’s biography would be introduced and how.

“During this segment Steve will take a trip down memory lane with YOU to talk about the different moments of YOUR life displayed in the photographs below,” the memo stated.

In the most amusing moment during the interview, Clinton acted ""surprised"" when the photos were placed on screen. “Oh boy. Oh my goodness,” she said when a photo of her at 12-years-old was placed on the screen.

Harvey also filmed segments for a special on the Flint water crisis that would air about four weeks later during the same taping session. Once again, Clinton was briefed ahead of time on the questions that Harvey would ask, including one on her February visit to the Michigan city and on efforts to address crime and joblessness.

One week later, Harvey endorsed Clinton for president.

After the report hit, a Harvey spokesperson sent the Washington Free Breacon the following statement: “As happens with many shows like ours, producers conduct pre-interviews highlighting areas of interest and possible questions. This allows the guests to prepare for their appearance and provides the most informative experience for the viewers.”"
203,http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/healthy-lifestyle-changes-to-make-today/,newsbbc,6 Healthy Lifestyle Changes to Make Today,['L. A. Mcdonough'],"Over the years, I’ve helped thousands of people make better choices for their life and their health. People from all backgrounds say they feel sick, tired, and depressed. What’s truly scary is that people begin to accept that feeling as normal.

It doesn’t have to be that way. You don’t have to, nor should you, resign yourself to feeling perpetually run-down and exhausted. Some of the most effective ways to improve your health are simple and accessible to almost everyone. You don’t need a lot of money; you just need the drive to cultivate healthy habits. When people ask me what the best medicine is, do you know what I tell them? The best medicine is a prevention-based lifestyle.

6 Tips for a Healthy Lifestyle

The six simplest things you can incorporate in your life are sunshine, clean air, fresh water, sleep, exercise, and most of all— a clean, healthy diet. That’s it. Improving these six things can improve anyone’s health. They require no fancy equipment, no special training, no 16-disc instructional DVD set, no payment plan. You can start improving your life yourself, today, right now.

1. Get Some Sunshine

Soaking up the sun has received a lot of bad press in recent years, and everyone now associates the sun’s UV rays with wrinkles and skin cancer. While it’s true that you shouldn’t spend all day in the sun, we’ve swung too far in the other direction, and people are quick to reach for chemically-suspect sunscreens or avoid the sun entirely. In reality, UV rays account for only about one-tenth of 1% of the total global burden of disease. You’re far more likely to get sick from too little sunlight.[1]

Moderate exposure to direct sunshine boosts the health of both your mind and body. In addition to enhancing your mental state, exposure to sunlight directly affects the body’s production of melatonin and can promote more restful sleep. Sunlight is also vital to the body’s ability to produce vitamin D, an incredibly important nutrient that supports cardiovascular health, bone health, and the immune system. In fact, sunlight is the best source of vitamin D, as the nutrient is relatively uncommon in food.

That’s not to say you should ignore the risk of UV-related cancer. As in all things health-related, you must find the right balance. Be smart about your level of sunshine exposure. Try to get at least 15-30 minutes of direct sunlight every day. Avoid sunscreens. At best, they prevent vitamin D production. Worse, many sunscreens contain harsh chemicals that can be absorbed through the skin and cause dozens of health problems. If you are out in the glaring sun all day, make use of shade and wear sunglasses, wide-brimmed hats, and loose-fitting, long-sleeved clothing to avoid sunburn. If you must use sunscreen, only buy organic, mineral and plant-based varieties.

2. Breathe Clean Air

As the old saying goes, you can survive weeks without food, days without water, but only a few minutes without air. Given its extreme importance, it almost goes without saying that the best air is fresh and clean.

Clean air helps prevent respiratory ailments like asthma or allergies and supplies your body with the oxygen that all living cells need. Breathing dirty air can cause big problems.

A lot of people associate poor air quality with smog or industrial pollution. You may be surprised to learn that, according to the EPA, indoor air quality is usually 2-5x worse than that outside. That may be a best-case scenario; in the worst cases, indoor air can be up to 100x more toxic.[2]

Oddly, efficient construction may be to blame. It’s energy efficient for a building to be sealed up tight, but it also allows for the accumulation and concentration of air pollutants. These pollutants include the VOCs and chemical fumes that off-gas from furniture, paint, flooring materials, and other indoor building materials.

Don’t think an air freshener is going to “clean” the air. Most air fresheners just release an equally toxic chemical fragrance to mask odors.[3] Instead, get an air purification device for your home, preferably one that uses both HEPA and UV filters. You can also open the windows and get a few houseplants; they’re excellent, natural air filters that release clean oxygen. Better yet, go outside in nature and enjoy the fresh air first hand.

3. Stay Hydrated

By some estimates, 75% of people suffer from chronic mild dehydration.[4] This affects your health in more ways than just feeling a bit thirsty. At a minimum, chronic dehydration causes a severe drop in your energy levels. Worse, since 70% of your body is water, dehydration can negatively affect every process in your body, including bone and tissue regeneration, natural detoxification abilities, immune function—all of it. Even blinking your eyes and the beating of your heart require water.

Madison Avenue marketing wizards spend millions of dollars trying to convince us that water is plain and boring. Instead, they say, we should quench our thirst with overpriced, carbonated liquid candy like soda and energy drinks. Don’t listen. You need fresh water to function; there is no substitute. Coffee, sodas, and energy drinks are not good sources of hydration. In fact, the caffeine and sugar are diuretics that cause your body to lose water. Avoid.

How much water do you need? Eight cups a day is the standard recommendation. That’s a fairly good rule of thumb, but it doesn’t account for body size or activity level. A better guideline is to drink half your bodyweight in ounces. For example, if you weigh 180 pounds, drink 90 ounces of water per day. Of course, people’s needs differ based on many factors. Body size, physical activity, external temperature, sweatiness, health, and dozens of other factors all affect how much water you need. Start with the half-your-weight rule as a base and add water as needed.

4. Get Enough Rest

Have you noticed that in some circles, missing several hours of sleep a night is considered a badge of honor while sleeping the full, recommended 8 hours is seen as a weakness? This thinking is completely backward.

Adequate sleep—about 7-8 hours a night for most people—is absolutely necessary for a healthy body and mind. Rest promotes normal hormone levels and neurotransmitter responses. Skipping sleep can lead to poor work performance, car accidents, relationship problems, anger, and depression.[5]

Why are so many people walking around completely exhausted? For most people, the problem isn’t that they’re too busy, it’s that they just need to turn off the TV, put down the phone, and close their eyes. In fact, trying to fall asleep with the TV or other gadgets on will only derail your body’s natural circadian rhythm.[6]

Just put away the smartphone and go to bed. Make your sleeping space as dark as possible. If that’s not feasible, try wearing a sleep mask. It’s a great strategy for blocking out light. And, just as you’ve always heard, aim for about 8 hours of sleep every night.

5. Exercise Often

Exercise is vital to your health and mood. Unequivocally, research shows that your chances of living a long, healthy life are better if you exercise regularly. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services advises that regular physical activity reduces mortality rates of many chronic diseases and helps improve or prevent many illnesses and conditions.[7]

You don’t need to have the physique of an Olympian to see health benefits. Even light to moderate exercise can offer tremendous health benefits. Although forty-five minutes to an hour is better for most people, just 30 minutes of moderate activity a few times a week can boost energy levels, help you sleep better, sharpen your mind, and strengthen your defense against illness.

To maximize the benefits, exercise outdoors. Studies have shown that exercising outside promotes endurance, enthusiasm, pleasure, and self-esteem. It also helps reduce depression and fatigue.[8] One study found that people who exercised outside exercised longer and more frequently.[9] Not to mention that exercising outdoors can also help you get your daily dose of sunshine.

6. Follow a Clean Diet

You may be familiar with the expression, “garbage in, garbage out.” The food you eat is a perfect example of that expression in action. Good nutrition is vital to your health. You can exercise and sleep twice as much as anyone else, but without a clean and balanced diet, you will feel down and fatigued.

There are many, many schools of thought on what type of diet is the best. Although there are a few unshakeable principles, it has to be an individual choice. Personally, I both follow and recommend a raw, vegan diet, but everyone has to decide what works for their life.

Most of the animals raised for mass production are raised in squalid conditions and treated inhumanely. Not only is this unnecessarily cruel, but it also promotes diseased animals that yield toxic animal products. A plant-based diet avoids these dangers, but if you do decide to consume meat and dairy, at least avoid the worst of it. Only consume animal products that are produced organically, in a free range environment, with ethical standards in place.

And, while it’s a contentious topic, I believe there’s more than sufficient evidence to avoid genetically modified food, AKA GMOs.[10] Italy, France, Germany, Greece, and dozens of other countries have limited or outright banned these foods. In the United States, however, they are everywhere. Buying organic food is the easiest way to avoid GMOs. According to both U.S. and Canadian law, a product with the “100% Certified Organic” label, it cannot contain any genetically modified organisms.

Finally, get in the habit of making your own food and avoid the mass-produced food products that are usually found in the center of the grocery store—boxed, packaged, and loaded with junk, especially refined carbohydrates. A few years ago, researchers at Princeton even confirmed that sugar is more addictive than heroin. It’s no surprise Americans buy more soda than water.[11]

Most of your grocery shopping should consist of whole, raw foods. Vegetables, fruit, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. I won’t say all prepackaged food is terrible for you, but the vast majority of them contain a minefield of suspect ingredients.

At the so-called Opening Day event, backers can—at the $1 million sponsorship level—score perks like a photo op with The Donald and a multi-day hunting trip with his two eldest sons. Donald Jr (“Don”) and Eric think it’s a lot of fun to kill defenseless wild animals for sport, and apparently the entire family believes that hunting is part of “the great American tradition of outdoor sporting,” along with “fishing and conservation.”

Given Trump’s position on climate change, we’re not sure what they mean by “conservation,” but we do know spending $1 million for direct access to the president and a hunting trip with the first sons seems like a far cry from the American dream. Yet, here we are, living in a world where the Trump family is sending out invitations for rich folks to buy in to the bastardization of the presidency. At the $1-million sponsorship level, dubbed “The Bald Eagle,” contributors also receive access to a private reception (VIP access to the POTUS, that is) and autographed guitars from one of the musical performers at the fundraising event.

Don and Eric Trump, the two eldest sons of the president-elect, have a solid history as big game hunters and are the responsible parties behind the new Texas-based nonprofit organization hosting this insane party, according to the Center for Public Integrity. Back in 2012 when their father was still known as a real estate mogul or perhaps just a reality TV star, a series of photos of the men circulated online. They posed with their kills after a hunting trip in Zimbabwe, and perhaps the most memorable shot shows the two brothers standing side-by-side sporting huge pearly grins while holding up the limp body of a leopard.

According to the TMZ report which broke the news of the party, country singer Toby Keith and the band Alabama are reportedly on deck to perform to an audience of guests donning a “Camouflage and Cufflinks” dress code (whatever that is). A leaked draft of the invitation promises that “all net proceeds from the Opening Day event will be donated to conservation charities” but, as CPI points out, those charity organizations have not been named and the nonprofit is not legally bound to identify them—or the names of the donors.

Any takers on a bet that Kanye West will buy in at the Bald Eagle level?

Dramatic public statement says series of recent leaks which have revealed

Hillary Clinton's campaign attacked Donald's Trump's friendliness towards Russia on Friday after the US government formally accused the country of recent cyber attacks related to the election.

The Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence announced in a joint statement that they were confident Russia's 'senior-most officials' ordered the attacks and seemingly accused Vladimir Putin of interference in the American political system.

It is impossible for such an explosive charge to have been made without authorization from President Obama.

On Friday evening, the Clinton camp tweeted: 'It should concern every American that Russia is willing to engage in such hostile acts in order to help Donald Trump become president.'

A statement from John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chair, questioned why Trump 'continues to make apologies for the Russians.'

Hillary Clinton's campaign attacked Donald's Trump's friendliness towards Russia on Friday after the US government formally accused the country of recent cyber attacks related to the election

The US government announced in a statement that they were confident Russia's 'senior-most officials' ordered the attacks and seemingly accused Vladimir Putin (above) of interference in the American political system

'The world now knows, beyond the shadow of any doubt, that the hack of the Democratic National Committee was carried out by the Russian government in a clear attempt to interfere with the integrity of our elections,' Podesta's statement reads.

'The only remaining question is why Donald Trump continues to make apologies for the Russians.

'Trump's initial reaction to the hack in July was to invite further intrusions by the Russians. Even after he was reportedly briefed on the very findings that were just announced publicly by U.S. government officials, he stood on a debate stage one week ago and played dumb about Russia's role in this hack.'

Podesta said that Trump has repeatedly 'praised Vladimir Putin, outlined a list of pro-Putin policies, and has done hundreds of millions of dollars of business with Russian interests.

'But even worse, Trump's own actions suggests he welcomes the help,' the statement reads. 'If he wants to reassure American voters, he must not only acknowledge and condemn Russia's role in this outrageous intrusion against U.S. interests, but he must finally disclose the full extent of his ties to Russia and divest any Russian-linked assets.'

Hillary Clinton's campaign tweeted the above message Friday evening

A statement from John Podesta (above), Clinton's campaign chair, questioned why Trump 'continues to make apologies for the Russians.'

The claim that leaks were the result of an operation ordered by 'senior-most Russian officials' would have to have been authorized by President Obama, who voted early electronically in the presidential election hours before it was issued

The joint statement issued by the US government earlier on Friday said it was 'confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.

'We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.'

It added: 'It would be extremely difficult for someone, including a nation-state actor, to alter actual ballot counts or election results by cyber attack or intrusion.

'This assessment is based on the decentralized nature of our election system in this country and the number of protections state and local election officials have in place. States ensure that voting machines are not connected to the Internet, and there are numerous checks and balances as well as extensive oversight at multiple levels built into our election process.'

The condemnation came amid escalating tensions between Washington and Moscow over a range of international disagreements, including U.S. charges that Russian air strikes in support of embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have been hitting hospitals and other civilian targets in rebel-held eastern Aleppo.

California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the vice-chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that '[t]he administration's acknowledgement that Russian intelligence agencies are attempting to influence the U.S. election and undermine public confidence conveys the seriousness of the threat.

'Attempted hacking of our election system is intolerable, and it's critical to convince the Russian government to cease these activities. If it does not, we must develop a strong response.'

Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who is Feinstein's counterpart in the House of Representatives, said in a statement on Friday that 'I applaud the administration's decision to publicly name Russia as the source of hacks into U.S. political institutions.'

'We should now work with our European allies who have been the victim of similar and even more malicious cyber interference by Russia to develop a concerted response that protects our institutions and deters further meddling.'

A 400-pound man named Ivan? Donald Trump downplayed the possibility of Russia's involvement in the hacks during the first presidential debate, saying it might have been China – or 'somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds'

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will be left to explain himself on Sunday during the second presidential debate.

In his first head-to-head with Clinton, he claimed Russia's purported involvement in the series of high-profile computer hacks was by no means a given.

'I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC,' he said.

'She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't – maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, okay?'

'Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over,' Trump claimed.

In August, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters flatly: 'It is the Russians.'

She called the attack on the DNC an 'electronic Watergate' akin to the 1972 burglary at Democratic Party headquarters in the Watergate office building that upended the Nixon presidency. 'This is a break-in.'"
206,http://freebeacon.com/politics/clinton-campaign-helped-script-steve-harvey-interview/,newsbbc,Clinton Campaign Helped Script Steve Harvey Interview,['Lachlan Markay'],"BY: Follow @lachlan



Talk show host Steve Harvey provided Hillary Clinton’s campaign with the exact questions he would ask of Clinton during a February interview, according to an internal campaign memo sent a week before the interview and obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.

""Steve is known to be a host who goes out of his way to make his guests feel comfortable,"" two of Clinton’s top communications aides wrote in a memo to Clinton a week ahead of her interview. ""We coordinated closely with the show’s producers on the script and format of the show.""

The memo, sent to Clinton on Feb. 17, 2016, by campaign spokeswoman Karen Finney and communications aide Betsaida Alcantara, was attached to an email posted on the website DCLeaks.com by hackers suspected of acting in concert with the Russian government.

One of the individuals behind the website provided the Free Beacon with a password to access that email and others sent to and from Clinton volunteer Beanca Nicholson, who was doing advance work for a campaign swing through Chicago that included the Harvey interview.

The campaign memo reveals that Clinton’s staff worked with Harvey to craft the structure of the interview, and briefed the Democratic presidential nominee ahead of time on the precise wording of Harvey’s questions.

The questions touched on Clinton’s granddaughter, her preference for deep dish or thin crust pizza, her campaign’s ""great start,"" efforts to bridge America’s racial divide, and her support for gun control policies.

According to the memo, Clinton’s staff saw Harvey’s show as an effective and low-risk way to reach out to female and African American voters. They also noted recent episodes of the show that focused on issues that Clinton had stressed during her campaign.

Clinton’s staff pitched the show on some of those issues, including gun control, and noted that Harvey would not likely force Clinton to go into detail defending her positions.

""Please note that the tone of the show is generally light so even on policy questions, Steve won’t go too deep into details,"" the memo noted.

The campaign and the show’s producers also agreed ahead of time on the structure of a segment that would explore Clinton’s biography and achievements.

""During this segment Steve will take a trip down memory lane with YOU to talk about the different moments of YOUR life displayed in the photographs below,"" the memo explained photos of Clinton that Harvey pulled up on screen as she discussed her childhood, education, relationship with her husband, and election to the U.S. Senate.

Clinton feigned surprise throughout the interview. ""Oh boy. Oh my goodness,"" she exclaimed as Harvey displayed a photo of her at 12 years old.

Harvey also filmed segments for a special on the Flint water crisis that would air about four weeks later during the same taping session. Once again, Clinton was briefed ahead of time on the questions that Harvey would ask, including one on her February visit to the Michigan city and on efforts to address crime and joblessness.

Requests for comment sent to Harvey’s personal email address and the address listed on his website were not returned. The Clinton campaign did not return a request for comment.

Update: After publication, a Harvey spokesperson sent the following statement: ""As happens with many shows like ours, producers conduct pre-interviews highlighting areas of interest and possible questions. This allows the guests to prepare for their appearance and provides the most informative experience for the viewers."""

Rex Tillerson, the former chairman and chief executive officer of ExxonMobil, testifies during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing to become U.S. Secretary of State on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 11, 2017 Kevin Lamarque—Reuters

China’s state media has responded forcefully to suggestions by U.S. Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson that China should be barred from the artificial islands it has built in the South China Sea, warning that any such attempt would force a “devastating confrontation” and both sides should “prepare for a military clash.""

On Wednesday, Tillerson told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Beijing’s ongoing island-building strategy in the busy waterway — through which $5 trillion of trade passes annually — was illegal and “akin to Russia’s taking of Crimea.”

“We’re going to have to send China a clear signal that, first, the island-building stops,” the former ExxonMobil CEO told the hearing. “And second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed.”

Beijing claims sovereignty over almost 90% of the South China Sea, competing with neighbors Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei, who also claim parts of the waterway. In a bid to bolster its presence, China has transformed seven reefs and islets through reclamation into artificial islands. The mini fortresses now host antiaircraft guns and other weaponry, according to recent analysis.

Although a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman declined to answer a journalist's question about possible responses to American naval incursions into the vital trade corridor, China’s notoriously strident state media pulled no punches.

“Tillerson's statements regarding the islands in the South China Sea are far from professional,” the Chinese Communist Party–linked Global Times declared in an editorial on Friday. “If Trump's diplomatic team shapes future Sino-U.S. ties as it is doing now, the two sides had better prepare for a military clash.”

The state-backed China Daily described Tillerson’s remarks as “a mishmash of naivety, shortsightedness, worn-out prejudices, and unrealistic political fantasies. Should he act on them in the real world, it would be disastrous [and] set a course for devastating confrontation between China and the U.S.”

Although Donald Trump has been fiercely critical of China during his campaign, his attacks have typically focused on alleged unfair trade practices that the U.S. President-elect claims have “stolen” American jobs. The Trump Administration’s trade team has been stocked with outspoken China trade hawks, such as Peter Navarro and Robert Lighthizer.

Given that Trump campaigned on drawing down expensive military commitments overseas, many believed any confrontation between the U.S. and China would be limited to commerce, and that the South China Sea would be less of a hot spot than it has been under the Obama Administration, which stepped up naval patrols in the region.

However, Zhu Feng, professor of international relations at Nanjing University, says the South China Sea will now remain an ""essential component"" of Washington's Asia-Pacific security strategy. “The entire U.S.-China relationship is a minefield,"" he tells TIME. ""There’s not one place to stick your foot.”"

209,http://yournewswire.com/scientific-study-towers-collapsed-due-to-controlled-demolition/,newsbbc,Scientific Study: Towers Collapsed Due To Controlled Demolition,"['Kathy Houseman', 'Max G Force', 'Jerry Hamilton', 'Heyzeus Belden']","A European scientific study has concluded that on September 11, 2001, the Twin Towers were brought down by a controlled demolition.

The study, conducted by four physicists and published in Europhysics Magazine, says that “the evidence points overwhelmingly to the conclusion that all three buildings were destroyed by controlled demolition.”

Wnd.com reports:

“Given the far-reaching implications, it is morally imperative that this hypothesis be the subject of a truly scientific and impartial investigation by responsible authorities,” the four physicists conclude.

The study is the work of Steven Jones, former full professor of physics at Brigham Young University, Robert Korol, a professor emeritus of civil engineering at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, Anthony Szamboti, a mechanical design engineer with over 25 years of structural design experience in the aerospace and communications industries, and Ted Walter, the director of strategy and development for Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth, a nonprofit organization that today represents more than 2,500 architects and engineers.

Conscious of the controversial nature of the report Europhysics included an editor’s note with the study in the September 2016 issue: “This feature is somewhat different from our usual purely scientific articles, in that it contains some speculation. However, given the timing and the importance of the issue, we consider that this feature is sufficiently technical and interesting to merit publication for our readers. Obviously, the content of this article is the responsibility of the authors.”

In August 2002, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology launched what would become a six-year investigation of the three building failures that occurred on 9/11. It found both the Twin Towers, as well as the 47-story World Trade Center Building 7, which was not struck by an airplane, all collapsed as a result of fires and intense heat. But even the NIST found that the three buildings were “the only known cases of total structural collapse in high-rise buildings where fires played a significant role.”

“It bears repeating that fires have never caused the total collapse of a steel-framed high-rise before or since 9/11,” the researchers write. “Did we witness an unprecedented event three separate times on September 11, 2001?”

The report also concluded: “Given the far-reaching implications, it is morally imperative that this hypothesis be the subject of a truly scientific and impartial investigation by responsible authorities.”

The researchers also found “the only phenomenon capable of collapsing such buildings completely has been by way of a procedure known as controlled demolition, whereby explosives or other devices are used to bring down a structure intentionally.”

They noted that “15 years after the event a growing number of architects, engineers, and scientists are unconvinced by that explanation.”

Here are some of the observations the researchers offered:

Fires typically are not hot enough and do not last long enough in any single area to generate enough energy to heat the large structural members to the point where they fail (the temperature at which structural steel loses enough strength to fail is dependent on the factor of safety used in the design. In the case of WTC 7, for example, the factor of safety was generally 3 or higher. Here, 67 percent of the strength would need to be lost for failure to ensue, which would require the steel to be heated to about 660°C);

Most high-rises have fire suppression systems (water sprinklers), which further prevent a fire from releasing sufficient energy to heat the steel to a critical failure state;

Structural members are protected by fireproofing materials, which are designed to prevent them from reaching failure temperatures within specified time periods;

Steel-framed high-rises are designed to be highly redundant structural systems. Thus, if a localized failure occurs, it does not result in a disproportionate collapse of the entire structure. Throughout history, three steel-framed high-rises are known to have suffered partial collapses due to fires; none of those led to a total collapse. Countless other steel-framed high-rises have experienced large, long-lasting fires without suffering either partial or total collapse. In addition to resisting ever-present gravity loads and occasional fires, high-rises must be designed to resist loads generated during other extreme events – in particular, high winds and earthquakes.

The physicists also note the Towers were specifically designed to withstand the impact and destructive force of airliners crashes.

They write:” The total collapse of WTC 7 at 5:20 pm on 9/11, is remarkable because it exemplified all the signature features of an implosion: The building dropped in absolute free fall for the first 2.25 seconds of its descent over a distance of 32 meters or eight stories. Its transition from stasis to free fall was sudden, occurring in approximately one-half second. It fell symmetrically straight down. Its steel frame was almost entirely dismembered and deposited mostly inside the building’s footprint, while most of its concrete was pulverized into tiny particles. Finally, the collapse was rapid, occurring in less than seven seconds. Given the nature of the collapse, any investigation adhering to the scientific method should have seriously considered the controlled demolition hypothesis, if not started with it. Instead, NIST (as well as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which conducted a preliminary study prior to the NIST investigation) began with the predetermined conclusion that the collapse was caused by fires.”

The original investigations did note: “The specifics of the fires in WTC 7 and how they caused the building to collapse remain unknown at this time. Although the total diesel fuel on the premises contained massive potential energy, the best hypothesis has only a low probability of occurrence.”

On March 2006, the NIST’s lead investigator, Dr. Shyam Sunder, was quoted as saying, “Truthfully, I don’t really know. We’ve had trouble getting a handle on building No. 7.”

“The collapse mechanics discussed above are only a fraction of the available evidence indicating that the airplane impacts and ensuing fires did not cause the collapse of the Twin Towers,” the report says. “Videos show that the upper section of each tower disintegrated within the first four seconds of collapse. After that point, not a single video shows the upper sections that purportedly descended all the way to the ground before being crushed. Videos and photographs also show numerous high-velocity bursts of debris being ejected from point-like sources. NIST refers to these as “puffs of smoke” but fails to properly analyze them. NIST also provides no explanation for the midair pulverization of most of the towers’ concrete, the near-total dismemberment of their steel frames, or the ejection of those materials up to 150 meters in all directions.”"

21st Century Wire says…

Finally, a US government official with character has emerged to condemn Washington’s clandestine support of extremist terrorists overseas.

Previously 21WIRE reported how US Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard (HI-D) received a somewhat hostile reception when talking with CNN’s Jake Tapper about her “Stop Funding Terrorism Bill.” Gabbard is the first US legislator since the 1980’s to openly highlight the very real problem of US clandestine services arming and supporting violent internatonal terrorist organizations, particularly those currently operating inside of Syria.

Interestingly, Gabbard’s important move to stop international terrorism comes at the exact same time when the outgoing President Obama has pushed his own executive action to lift all restrictions on US arms exports and support to proxy “rebel” or terrorist fighting groups operating in Syria and elsewhere. In this context, we can see clearly that there is a moral battle being fought in Washington – between those who oppose terrorism – and those like President Obama and Senator John McCain, who have seen it as ‘useful’ in the pursuit of their own geopolitical objectives, particularly by their open support of terrorist factions in Syria.

The following piece of legislation was introduced on in the US Congress on December 8, 2016…



Gabbard House.gov

Washington, DC — Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (HI-02) introduced the Stop Arming Terrorists Act today. The legislation would prohibit the U.S. government from using American taxpayer dollars to provide funding, weapons, training, and intelligence support to groups like the Levant Front, Fursan al Ha and other allies of Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, al-Qaeda and ISIS, or to countries who are providing direct or indirect support to those same groups.

The legislation is cosponsored by Reps. Peter Welch (D-VT-AL), Barbara Lee (D-CA-13), Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA-48), and Thomas Massie (R-KY-04), and supported by the Progressive Democrats of America (PDA) and the U.S. Peace Council.



.

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard said, “Under U.S. law it is illegal for any American to provide money or assistance to al-Qaeda, ISIS or other terrorist groups. If you or I gave money, weapons or support to al-Qaeda or ISIS, we would be thrown in jail. Yet the U.S. government has been violating this law for years, quietly supporting allies and partners of al-Qaeda, ISIL, Jabhat Fateh al Sham and other terrorist groups with money, weapons, and intelligence support, in their fight to overthrow the Syrian government.[i]

“The CIA has also been funneling weapons and money through Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar and others who provide direct and indirect support to groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda. This support has allowed al-Qaeda and their fellow terrorist organizations to establish strongholds throughout Syria, including in Aleppo.

“A recent New York Times article confirmed that ‘rebel groups’ supported by the U.S. ‘have entered into battlefield alliances with the affiliate of al-Qaeda in Syria, formerly known as al Nusra.’ This alliance has rendered the phrase ‘moderate rebels’ meaningless. Reports confirm that ‘every armed anti-Assad organization unit in those provinces [of Idlib and Aleppo] is engaged in a military structure controlled by [al-Qaeda’s] Nusra militants.’

“A recent Wall Street Journal article reported that many rebel groups are ‘doubling down on their alliance’ with al Nusra. Some rebel groups are renewing their alliance, while others, like Nour al-Din al-Zinki, a former CIA-backed group and one of the largest factions in Aleppo are joining for the first time. “The Syria Conquest Front—formerly known as the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front—is deeply intermingled with armed opposition groups of all stripes across Syria’s battlefields.”

“The CIA has long been supporting a group called Fursan al Haqq, providing them with salaries, weapons and support, including surface to air missiles. This group is cooperating with and fighting alongside an al-Qaeda affiliated group trying to overthrow the Syrian government. The Levant Front is another so-called moderate umbrella group of Syrian opposition fighters. Over the past year, the United States has been working with Turkey to give this group intelligence support and other forms of military assistance. This group has joined forces with al-Qaeda’s offshoot group in Syria.

“This madness must end. We must stop arming terrorists. The Government must end this hypocrisy and abide by the same laws that apply to its’ citizens.”

“That is why I’ve introduced the Stop Arming Terrorists bill—legislation based on congressional action during the Iran-Contra affair to stop the CIA’s illegal arming of rebels in Nicaragua. It will prohibit any Federal agency from using taxpayer dollars to provide weapons, cash, intelligence, or any support to al-Qaeda, ISIS and other terrorist groups, and it will prohibit the government from funneling money and weapons through other countries who are directly or indirectly supporting terrorists,” concluded Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.

Stephen Kinzer, a senior fellow at the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University, and award-winning author and journalist said, “The proposal to stop sending weapons to insurgents in Syria is based on the principle that pouring arms into a war zone only intensifies suffering and makes peace more difficult to achieve. Congress made a decision like this about the Nicaraguan contras during the 1980s. Aid to the contras was cut off by the Boland Amendment. The result was a peace process that finally brought an end to wars not only in Nicaragua, but also in El Salvador and Guatemala. This is the example we should be following. Cutting off arms shipments forces belligerents to negotiate. That is what we achieved in Nicaragua. It should be our goal in Syria as well.”

Donna Smith, Executive Director of Progressive Democrats of America said, “Progressive Democrats of America believes that it is fundamentally wrong for the United States to fund those groups or individuals aligned with al-Qaeda, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, ISIS, or other terrorist/extremist organizations. The ‘Stop Arming Terrorists’ bill authored by Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, of Hawaii’s 2nd Congressional District, would help bring an end to the human tragedy unfolding in Syria where the haunting eyes of the innocent children of Aleppo call on us all to stop supporting those who threaten and kill them with ferocious intention. War is war, and terrorism is terrorism whether waged by the state or from external forces. PDA supports this measure.”

Alfred Marder, President of the U.S. Peace Council said, “The U.S. Peace Council is honored to endorse and support the ‘Stop Arming Terrorists Bill’ as a major contribution to peace. This legislation will serve to galvanize the anti-war movement and the opposition to regime change policies that characterize our present foreign policy.”

Background: The Stop Arming Terrorists bill prohibits U.S. government funds from being used to support al-Qaeda, ISIS or other terrorist groups. In the same way that Congress passed the Boland Amendment to prohibit the funding and support to CIA backed-Nicaraguan Contras during the 1980’s, this bill would stop CIA or other Federal government activities in places like Syria by ensuring U.S. funds are not used to support al-Qaeda, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, ISIS, or other terrorist groups working with them. It would also prohibit the Federal government from funding assistance to countries that are directly or indirectly supporting those terrorist groups. The bill achieves this by:"

Update: In the days since this news first broke, the Trump transition team released a statement saying they did not approve the details of the event. However, they did not deny that Trump’s sons serve as directors of the “Opening Day Foundation” nor the authenticity of the original documents mentioned in this article. However, a newly released invitation of the event did not mention any Trump family members as a part of the post-inaugration “opening day” experience

Though many Trump supporters hoped that the soon-to-be President would stand up for the “little guy,” recent developments seem to suggest that Donald Trump and his family are more interested in the lucrative connections and business opportunities they are set to gain through their newfound status as the First Family. A Texas-based non-profit, called the “Opening Day Foundation,” managed by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, is already selling access to Trump for the day after his official inauguration (hence the name “opening day”) via a fundraiser. The fundraiser, set to benefit unnamed “conservation charities,” was marketed as “your opportunity to play a significant role as our family commemorates the inauguration of our father, friend, and President Donald J. Trump,” according to promotional materials obtained by TMZ.

The event offers six sponsorship levels ranging from $25,000 to $1 million. The highest level, titled “The Bald Eagle,” offers a private reception and photo shoot with the newly-minted President, four autographed guitars from Toby Keith and the band Alabama, and a multi-day hunting or fishing trips with Trump’s sons and their confidants. Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump are known for their enthusiasm for long-standing American pastimes of hunting and fishing, though they also have had more than one foray into big game hunting. In a May interview with the New Yorker, Donald Trump Jr alluded to his affinity for the outdoors and his defense of keeping public land in the hands of the people, a controversial issue among outdoorsmen. Though some liberal media outlets have doubted whether the fundraiser will really benefit conservation causes or not, they fail to recognize the possibility that Trump’s sons are not carbon copies of their father.

However, the issue here is not whether or not the fundraiser will actually benefit conservation efforts, but is instead the precedent the fundraiser sets for a “pay to play” set-up in the upcoming Trump administration. The term “pay to play” was largely associated with Democrats during the past election as Hillary Clinton’s shady dealings via the Clinton Foundation showed that her family’s “charity” was little more than a slush fund used to collect money from those who wanted access. Trump criticized the arrangement on more than one occasion on the campaign trail, but it seems that this may be yet another one of his “flip-flops” since winning the electoral contest last month. Considering the enormous wealth of his cabinet picks (nearly $14 billion in combined net worth) and the lofty sums required for personal access to Trump and his kin, it is becoming more and more likely that the next administration will be less about “draining the swamp” and more about expanding the family’s business empire and influence.

It is actually damaging to your health to work too hard and not get enough rest. Yet, many people are doing this on a regular basis. In America, we do everything on the go and at a hurried pace. Slowing down and taking a breather is mandatory!

Just as you need to breathe deeply (literally) from time to time to gain clarity, you also need to sleep to take care of the mind and body. It is how we are designed to recuperate from the activities of the day. Proper rest also is needed for your morning elimination cycle to be healthy.

One way to facilitate good sleep is to sleep in the darkest setting you can tolerate. Light disturbs the rhythm of the pineal gland’s production of serotonin and melatonin. If you need some light at night, it’s a good idea to not have it evenly in your line of sight. And, along with diminishing the quality of your rest, it also can ruin your night vision.

But, the well-scripted performance raised some suspicion with a YouTuber named Spanglevision who decided to dig a little deeper. And, wouldn't you know it, the ""random"" participant was none other than child actor, Brennan Leach, whose father just happens to be Pennsylvania democratic State Senator Daylin Leach. Oh, and in case it wasn't obvious, Daylin supports Hillary for president...shocking.

So, here was the original question from Brennan:

Brennan: ""Hi Madam Secretary. I'm Brennan and I'm 15 years old. At my school, body image is a really big issue for girls my age. I see with my own eyes the damage Donald Trump does when he talks about women and how they look. As the first female president how would you undo some of that damage and help girls understand that they're so much more than just what they look like?""

And here was Hillary's attempt at knocking the soft ball out of the park...it's almost like she knew the question was coming.

Hillary: ""I'm so proud of you for asking that question. You are right -- my opponent has just taken this concern to a new level of difficulty and meanness. And, it's shocking when women are called names and judged solely on the basis of physical attributes. ""My opponent insulted Miss Universe. I mean, how do you get more acclaimed than that? But, it wasn't good enough. So we can't take any of this seriously any more. We need to laugh at it. We need to refute it. We need to ignore it. And we need to stand up to it.""

Here is the full analysis from Spanglevision. Among other things, he points out that Brennan is the only participant of the night who reads her question from a prepared script.

And, of course, as pointed out by Spanglevision, the mainstream media couldn't get enough of the adorable young girl and her ""brave"" question. Here's coverage from the New York Times....

...and CNN...

In fact, pretty much everyone covered the story including The Washington Post, New York Magazine, The Chicago Tribune, Cosmopolitan...it's pretty hard to find a media outlet that didn't cover it actually.

But this isn't young Brennan's first acting gig in the political circus. Turns out her dad, Daylin, utilized her acting skills in the following campaign video when he ran for Congress back in 2014.

And, just in case you would like to see more of her acting work, here is Brennan acting in a movie entitled ""Once Upon A Time Trillium Vein."""

Terminology

The abbreviation, “MB/s”, used below refers to “Mega Bytes per Second”. This should not be confused with the abbreviation “Mb/s” or “Mbps” which refer to “Mega Bits per Second”; these later abbreviations are often used by Internet Service Providers (ISP’s) to express the transfer speeds available on their networks. As a rule of thumb, divide Mb/s by 8 to arrive at an equivalent rate expressed in MB/s.

Overview

This study analyzes the file metadata found in a 7zip archive file, 7dc58-ngp-van.7z, attributed to the Guccifer 2.0 persona. For an in depth analysis of various aspects of the controversy surrounding Guccifer 2.0, refer to Adam Carter’s blog, Guccifer 2.0: Game Over.

Based on the analysis that is detailed below, the following key findings are presented:

On 7/5/2016 at approximately 6:45 PM Eastern time, someone copied the data that eventually appears on the “NGP VAN” 7zip file (the subject of this analysis). This 7zip file was published by a persona named Guccifer 2, two months later on September 13, 2016.

Due to the estimated speed of transfer (23 MB/s) calculated in this study, it is unlikely that this initial data transfer could have been done remotely over the Internet.

The initial copying activity was likely done from a computer system that had direct access to the data. By “direct access” we mean that the individual who was collecting the data either had physical access to the computer where the data was stored, or the data was copied over a local high speed network (LAN).

They may have copied a much larger collection of data than the data present in the NGP VAN 7zip. This larger collection of data may have been as large as 19 GB. In that scenario the NGP VAN 7zip file represents only 1/10th of the total amount of material taken.

This initial copying activity was done on a system where Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) settings were in force. Most likely, the computer used to initially copy the data was located somewhere on the East Coast.

The data was likely initially copied to a computer running Linux, because the file last modified times all reflect the apparent time of the copy and this is a characteristic of the the Linux ‘cp’ command (using default options).

A Linux OS may have been booted from a USB flash drive and the data may have been copied back to the same flash drive, which will likely have been formatted with the Linux (ext4) file system.

On September 1, 2016, two months after copying the initial large collection of (alleged) DNC related content (the so-called NGP/VAN data), a subset was transferred to working directories on a system running Windows. The .rar files included in the final 7zip file were built from those working directories.

The computer system where the working directories were built had Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) settings in force. Most likely, this system was located somewhere on the East Coast.

The .rar files and plain files that eventually end up in the “NGP VAN” 7zip file disclosed by Guccifer 2.0 on 9/13/2016 were likely first copied to a USB flash drive, which served as the source data for the final 7zip file. There is no information to determine when or where the final 7zip file was built.

Analysis

The Guccifer 2 “NGP VAN” files are found in a password protected 7zip file; instructions for downloading this 7zip file can be found at https://pastebin.com/fN9uvUE0.

Technical note: the size of the 7zip file is 711,396,436 bytes and the MD5 sum is: a6ca56d03073ce6377922171fc8b232d.

This .7z file contains several .rar files – one for each top-level directory, as shown below.

The times shown above are in Pacific Daylight Savings Time (PDT). The embedded .rar files are highlighted in yellow. The “*” after each file indicates that the file is password encrypted. This display of the file entries is shown when the .7z file is opened. A password is required to extract the constituent files. This aspect of the .7z file likely motivated zipping the sub-directories (e.g. CNBC and DNC) into .rar files; this effectively hides the structure of the sub-directories, unless the password is provided and the sub-directories are then extracted. The last modification dates indicate that the .rar files were built on 9/1/2016 and all the other files were copied on 7/5/2016. Note that all the times are even (accurate only to the nearest 2 seconds); the significance of this property will be discussed near the end of this analysis. The files copied on 7/5/2016 have last modified times that are closely clustered around 3:50 PM (PDT); the significance of those times will be described below.

The Guccifer 2 “NGP/VAN” file structure is populated by opening the .7z file and then extracting the top-level files inclusive of the .rar files. The .rar files are further unpacked (using WinRAR) into directories with a name derived by dropping the .rar suffix.

Note: although other archive programs claim to handle .rar files, only WinRAR will reliably restore the archived files, inclusive of their sub-microsecond last modification times.

The times recorded in those .rar files are local (relative) times; this determination is detailed in the blog post, RAR Times: Local or UTC? . The times recorded in the .7z file are absolute (UTC) times. If you look at the recorded .rar file times, you will see times like “7/5/2016 6:39:18 PM” and the times in the .7z file will be at some offset to that depending on your time zone. For example, if you are in the Pacific (daylight savings) time zone, the files shown in the .7z file will read 3 hours earlier than those shown in the .rar files, as shown below.

In this case, we need to adjust the .7z file times to reflect Eastern Time. Something like this command if you are on the West Coast (using Cygwin) will make the adjustment.

find . -exec touch -m -r {} -d '+3 hour' {} \;

The .rar files can be unpacked normally because they will appear with the same times as shown in the archive.

Conclusion 1: The DNC files were first copied to a system which had Eastern Time settings in effect; therefore, this system was likely located on the East Coast. This conclusion is supported by the observation that the .7z file times, after adjustment to East Coast time fall into the range of the file times recorded in the .rar files.

Next, we generate (for example, using a Cygwin bash prompt) a tab-separated list of files sorted by last modified date.



echo -e 'Top\tPath\tFile\tLast Mod\tSize' > ../guc2-files.txt # Truncate the 10 fractional digits in last mod time to 3. # Excel won't print more than 3 fractional digits anyway. find * -type f -printf '%h\t%f\t%TF %TT\t%s

' | \ sort -t$'\t' -k3 -k1 -k2 | \ perl -F'/\t/' -lane '$F[2] =~ s/(?<=\.\d{3})\d+$//; ($top=$F[0])=~s{/.*}{}; print join (""\t"", $top, @F);' \ >> ../guc2-files.txt



This file is then imported into an Excel spreadsheet for analysis.

Many archive file formats (e.g., zip and 7zip) record file times only to whole second resolution. The .rar format however records file times to a higher (nanosecond) resolution. This can be difficult to confirm; the GUI interface will only display whole seconds. The included command line utility, rar, however can be used to display the sub-second resolution. The lt (“list technical”) command will provide further detail. For example, the following command will list additional detail on the file 48HourNotice-20081019-174240.fec in the FEC.rar archive.

""c:\Program Files\WinRAR\rar"" lt FEC.rar FEC\48HourNotice-20081019-174240.fec

Conclusion 2: The DNC files were first copied to a file system that was formatted either as an NTFS file system (typically used on Windows systems) or to a Linux (ext4) file system. This conclusion is supported by the observation that the .rar file(s) show file last modified times (mtime) with 7 significant decimal digits (0.1 microsecond resolution) ; this is a characteristic of NTFS file systems.

It is possible that the DNC files were initially copied to a system running Linux and then later copied to a Windows system. Modern Linux implementations use the ext4 file system by default; ext4 records file times in nanoseconds. Thus, if the files were initially copied to a Linux ext4 file system and subsequently copied to a Windows NTFS file system the file times would have been preserved with the 0.1 microsecond precision shown above.

We observe that the last modified times are clustered together in a 14 minute time period on 2016-07-05. If the DNC files were copied in the usual way to a computer running a Windows operating system (e.g., using drag-and-drop in the File Explorer) the last modified times would typically not change (from the original) — the create time would change instead (to the time of the copy). The Windows File Explorer will typically only show the last modified time (by default). A file copy operation using the ‘cp’ command line utility commonly found on a UNIX system (e.g., Linux and Mac OS X) however will (by default) change the last modified time to the time that the copied file was written.

Conclusion 3: The DNC files may have been copied using the ‘cp‘ command (which is available on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X in some form). This (tentative) conclusion is supported by the observation that all of the file last modified times were changed to the apparent time of the copy operation. Other scenarios may produce this pattern of last modified times, but none were immediately apparent to this author at the time that this article was published.

The combination of an NTFS file system and the use of the UNIX ‘cp’ command is sufficiently unusual to encourage a further search for a more plausible scenario/explanation. One scenario that fits the facts would be that the DNC files were initially copied to a system running Linux (e.g., Ubuntu). The system might have had Linux installed on the system’s hard drive, or Linux may have been booted from a USB flash drive; bootable flash drive images with Linux installed on them are widely available.

A review of the DNC file metadata leads to the observation that significant “time gaps” appear between various top-level directories and files. In the spreadsheet, we first mark (with x’s) places where the top-level directory name changes or the top-level directory is the root (“.”) directory. We further calculate the “time gap” which is the difference between the last mod. time of a current entry and its previous entry; from this we subtract an approximation of the transfer time (using our knowledge of average transfer speed) to go from the last mod time to a likely time that the transfer started. We use a cut off of at least 3 seconds to filter out anomalies due to normal network/OS variations. Here are the entries with significant time gaps.

Conclusion 4: The overall time to obtain the DNC files found in the 7z file was 14 minutes; a significant part of that time (13 minutes) is allocated to time gaps that appear between several of the top-level files and directories.

Note that significant time gaps always occur at top-level directory changes (only x’s in the “Top-Level Changed” column). To put the time gaps in better perspective, here is a listing of all top-level changes. A top-level change is defined as either a change in the top-level directory name, or when the parent directory of a file is the root (“.”) directory.

In the “Last Mod” ordered list above, top-level directories and files are intermixed, and they are not in alphabetic order. This pattern can be explained by the use of the UNIX cp command. The cp command copies files in “directory order”, which on many systems is unsorted and will appear to be somewhat random.

The time gaps that appear in the chronologically ordered listing above could indicate that these files and directories were chosen from a much larger collection of copied files; this larger collection of files may have first been copied en masse via the ‘cp -r’ command.

Initially when this data was analyzed, the “time gaps” were attributed to “think time”, where it was assumed that the individual who collected the files would copy the files in small batches and in between each batch would need some “think time” to find or decide on the next batch to copy. This may be an equally valid way to explain the presence of time gaps at various junctures in the top-level files and folders. However, in this analysis we will assume that a much larger collection of files were initially copied on 7/5/2016; the files in the final .7z file (the subject of this analysis) represent only a small percentage of all the files that were initially collected.

We can estimate the transfer speed of the copy by dividing the total number of bytes transferred by the transfer time. The transfer time is approximated by subtracting the time gap total from the total elapsed time of the copy session. This calculation is shown below.

Conclusion 5: The lengthy time gaps suggest that many additional files were initially copied en masse and that only a small subset of that collection was selected for inclusion into the final 7zip archive file (that was subsequently published by Guccifer 2).

Given the calculations above, if 1.98 GB were copied at a rate of 22.6 MB/s and all the time gaps were attributed to additional file copying then approximately 19.3 GB in total were initially copied. In this hypothetical scenario, the 7zip archive represents only about 10% of the total amount of data that was initially collected.

Conclusion 6: The initial DNC file collection activity began at approximately 2016-07-05 18:39:02 EDT and ended at 2016-07-05 18:53:17 EDT. This conclusion is supported by the observed last modified times and the earlier conclusion that the ex-filtrated files were copied to a computer located in the Eastern Time zone.

Conclusion 7. A transfer rate of 23 MB/s is estimated for this initial file collection operation. This transfer rate can be achieved when files are copied over a LAN, but this rate is too fast to support the hypothesis that the DNC data was initially copied over the Internet (esp. to Romania). This transfer rate can also be achieved when copying directly from a computer’s hard drive to a fairly slow USB flash drive; there is a lot variability in USB flash drive speeds. To get a sense of where 23MB/s (23 Mega Bytes per Second) falls in the range of supported speeds for various network and media storage technologies, consult the blog entry titled MB: Mega Bytes or Mega Bits?. We can shorten this statement and say that the 23 MB/s transfer rate supports the conclusion that the files were initially copied locally and not over the Internet.

We turn our attention to the .rar files embedded in the .7z file. Here is an illustrative example (FEC.rar).

From this listing of FEC.rar above, we make the following observations:

The directories were last modified on 9/1/2016 at approximately 12:50 PM.

The file entries are shown with last modified times on

7/5/2016 at approximately 6:45 PM.

7/5/2016 at approximately 6:45 PM. We note that the last modification date for FEC.rar is 12:56:56 PM, EDT on 9/1/2016 after adjusting this time stamp to the Eastern Time zone.

As mentioned earlier, the seconds part of the file and directory last modified times are recorded in the .rar file with a 0.1 microsecond resolution, which is typical of an NTFS file system.

The file last modified times maintain the 7/15/2016 date – they were not changed to dates and times on 9/1/2016 when the sub-directories were created.

last modified times maintain the 7/15/2016 date – they were not changed to dates and times on 9/1/2016 when the sub-directories were created. When WinRAR restored the .rar files it preserved the directory last modification times recorded in the .rar file.

Recall that the NGP/VAN 7zip file has several .rar files which unpack into top-level directories. We can correlate the last modified times of the .rar files with the last modified times of the directories saved in the .rar files as shown below.

Conclusion 8: The .rar files that ultimately are included in the NGP/VAN 7zip file were built on a computer system where the Eastern Daylight Savings Time (EDT) time zone setting was in force. This conclusion is supported by the observation that if the .rar last modified times are adjusted to EDT they fall into the same range as the last modified times for the directories archived in the .rar files.

In the following table, we combine the last modified times of the directories restored from the .rar files with the last modified times of the .rar files themselves and sort by last modified time. The .rar file last modified times shown have been adjusted so that they reflect Eastern Daylight Savings Time (EDT).

From this data, we make the following observations.

On 9/1/2016, some of the directories that were initially collected on 7/5/2016 were copied to working directories. The working directories were zipped into .rar files that were added to the 7zip file that is the subject of this analysis.

The working directories likely reside on an NTFS-formatted file system (they have last modified times with 0.1 microsecond resolution – typical of NTFS). The NTFS file system is commonly used in modern Windows operating system installations.

The DNC directory was the first directory copied to its working directory.

Shortly after that, “DNC.rar” was created.

A series of directories (“DonorAnalysis” through “FEC”) were copied to their working directories.

Shortly after that, the .rar files were created from those working directories.

Approximately 7 minutes later, two more directories were copied to their working directories: “Reports for Kaine” and “Security“.

Finally, almost 3 hours after that, the .rar files were created from those two working directories

We notice no obvious pattern in the order of choosing the directories to copy to their working copies nor in the creation of .rar files.

The varying order of copying directories to their working copies and the observation that they may have been copied in at least three separate batches adds support to the theory that these directories were selected from a larger collection of files and directories that was initially collected on 7/5/2016.

Given the lack of uniformity in the metadata, we decided not to try to estimate the transfer times for the copy operations which copied the source directories to their working copies.

A question that comes up at this point is: Why were the directories first copied to a working directory before zipping them into .rar files? Two alternative explanations are offered:

The larger collection of files that were copied on 7/5/2016 reside on a computer running the Linux operating system. They need to be copied to a Windows operating system if programs like WinRAR (which runs only on Windows) are going to be used. In this case they may have been exported from the Linux system via a Samba network share.

Or, the larger collection of files that were copied on 7/5/2016 is some distance away from the system where the .rar files will be built; they need to be copied over the Internet. It makes sense to transfer only the directories that have been selected for inclusion into the 7zip file, because copying the entire collection over the Internet may be relatively slow.

Neither of the alternatives above suggest that making local working copies was truly necessary, because if we hypothesize that the original collection was exported via a network share, it would seem that this share could have been used directly. That may not have occurred to the person building the .rar files, or perhaps they had some other motivation to make local copies. One idea might be that the local working copies were made to facilitate some internal pruning, but we so no evidence of that — the time gaps occur only at the top level (as discussed earlier).

Conclusion 9: The final copy (on 9/1/2016) from the initial file collection to working directories was likely done with a conventional drag-and-drop style of copy. This conclusion is based on the observation that the file last modified times were preserved when copying from the initial collection to the working copies, unlike the first copy operation on 7/5/2016 (which is attributed to the use of the cp command).

Conclusion 10: The final working directories were likely created on an NTFS file system present on a computer running Windows. This conclusion is based on the following observations: (1) the file timestamps have 0.1 micro-second resolution (a characteristic of NTFS file systems), (2) NTFS file systems are widely used on Windows systems, (3) NTFS file systems are typically not used on USB flash drives, and (4) WinRAR is a Windows based program and was likely used to build the .rar files.

At the beginning of this analysis, we noted that the seconds part of the file last modified times that appear at the top-level in the .7z file were all even (a multiple of 2). Windows FAT formatted volumes are constrained to represent times only to the nearest two (2) seconds. USB flash drives are typically formatted FAT or FAT32.

Conclusion 11: The .rar files and plain files that were combined into the final .7z file (the subject of this analysis) were likely copied to a FAT-formatted flash drive first. This conclusion is supported by the observation that the seconds part of all the last modified times are all exact multiples of 2."
219,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3842846/Rumors-swirl-Pamela-Anderson-poisoned-Julian-Assange-vegan-meal-Pret.html,newsbbc,Rumors swirl that Pamela Anderson poisoned Julian Assange with vegan meal from Pret,"['Anneta Konstantinides For Dailymail.Com', 'Martin Robinson', 'Uk Chief Reporter For Mailonline']","WikiLeaks continues to release damaging information about Hillary Clinton from the hacked emails of her campaign's chairman John Podesta

Now he claims that state agents have 'severed' his embassy internet link

Many on Twitter believed the tweets, which referenced John Kerry, Ecuador and the UK Foreign Office, were triggered by Assange's death

Said Assange joked she had 'tortured' him by bringing only vegan food

Julian Assange says his internet link was 'severed' by the country granting him asylum just hours after claims he was poisoned by a Pret vegan sandwich brought to him by Pamela Anderson.

The WikiLeaks founder's only connection to the outside world from his Ecuadorian embassy hideout in London was cut today, with supporters saying America was behind the cyber attack.

But the organisation has since confirmed it was actually Ecuador who cut off his internet access shortly after Saturday night's publication of what appeared to be speeches Hilary Clinton was paid to deliver to financial giant Goldman Sachs.

Wikileaks tweeted this evening: 'We can confirm Ecuador cut off Assange's internet access Saturday, 5pm GMT, shortly after publication of Clinton's Goldman Sachs speechs.'

Revealed: Julian Assange, pictured on October 4, is alive but WikiLeaks claim his internet connection was cut by 'state' agents this morning

Visit: Rumours started that Julian Assange died after eating a poisoned vegan Pret a Manger meal that was brought to his room by Pamela Anderson on Saturday (pictured)

But Wikileaks revealed this morning that Assange's internet link had been 'intentionally severed by a state party'

It is not clear why Ecuador severed the connection but a source at the Ecuadorian Ministry in Ecuador previously said it would not respond to Twitter speculation but reiterated its commitment to Assange.

The source said: 'We don't respond to speculation circulating on Twitter.

'Ecuador will continue to protect Julian Assange and uphold the political asylum granted to him in 2012.'

The controversial anti-secrecy website has been busy aggravating Washington - in particular the Clinton family - this month by methodically releasing damaging information about the prospective First Family from the hacked emails of Hillary's campaign’s chairman John Podesta.

The Clinton campaign has called the hacking akin to a modern Watergate and has blamed the Russians for trying to influence the presidential elections, which WikiLeaks denies.

It came as bizarre rumors spread that Mr Assange may have died over the weekend after a visit from Pamela Anderson, 49.

On Saturday the former Baywatch star walked into the Ecuadorian embassy in London clutching bags from Pret A Manger, the popular UK sandwich shop.

HOW SUN-STARVED ASSANGE'S HEALTH HAS SUFFERED IN EMBASSY The hacker has endured a self-imposed imprisonment in a single room after being given diplomatic asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London’s Knightsbridge. The embassy — strewn with red, yellow and blue Ecuadorian flags — takes up a single floor of an imposing block behind Harrods. Initially, Assange slept on an inflatable mattress donated by embassy staff, who are described as having become ‘like family’ to him. But when it became clear his stay was not going to be temporary, a small room was transformed into his living quarters and a bed installed. He is thought to have stood in direct sunlight for only about 20 minutes during his incarceration, when he emerged on the balcony to address his supporters in August 2012. He has a specially adapted lamp to mimic sunlight in his room — which measures just 15ft by 13ft. Near a Victorian fireplace he has a treadmill donated by the Left-wing film-maker Ken Loach and in his first year at the embassy he notched up 744 miles on the running machine. Sources have said his health has suffered ever since he walked in four years ago, and there is a suspicion Assange, still unapologetic about his role in leaking government secrets, had pushed to leave because of illness.

She said afterwards she was worried for his health and when a series of mysterious tweets were sent by WikiLeaks on Sunday his fans feared that he had perished after eating her food.

Assange, 45, who has been hiding in the London embassy since 2012 to avoid sex crime allegations in Sweden, is alive and well according to the embassy and now appears to be the victim of a cyber attack.

At 6.30am this morning WikiLeaks tweeted: 'Julian Assange's internet link has been intentionally severed by a state party', with conspiracy theorists claiming that it is linked to John Kerry's visit to London to meet Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.

WikiLeaks say they 'have activated the appropriate contingency plans' as they try to restore his internet link.

It all began when Anderson paid Assange a visit on Saturday at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he has been hiding out for more than four years to avoid a rape investigation in his native Sweden.

In her hands were two bags from Pret, a popular sandwich shop chain based in the UK.

Anderson, an advocate for animals' rights, later said that she brought Assange 'a nice vegan lunch'.

'He said I tortured him with bringing him vegan food,' she then joked.

The former Playboy model said the WikiLeaks founder was doing 'really well' but expressed concern for him and his family.

The Australian has been living in the embassy for over four years and has been granted political asylum by Ecuador.

He is due to be questioned over a sex allegation in Sweden - which he denies. Mr Assange believes that if he goes to Sweden he will be extradited to the United States for questioning over the activities of WikiLeaks.

The ex-Baywatch star told the Press Association: 'I really believe in him and think he's a good person, and I'm concerned about his health, his family, and I just hope that by some miracle he's set free.'

Twitter was alight with the conspiracy theory on Sunday night after these three tweets that appeared to be coded were posted on the WikiLeaks account and branded a 'dead man's switch'

Twitter was alight with the conspiracy theory on Sunday night after a series of tweets that appeared to be coded were posted on the official WikiLeaks account.

The three tweets were headlined 'pre-commitment 1: John Kerry', 'pre-commitment 2: Ecuador' and 'pre-commitment 3: UK FCO', the latter appearing to refer to the United Kingdom's Foreign & Commonwealth Office.

Each tweet was then followed by a series of numbers and letters, causing many on the social media site to believe they were a 'dead man's switch' meant to be activated if Assange is killed.

The conspiracy theories were also fueled by the fact that WikiLeaks dumped more than 1,000 emails leaked from the account of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, to the public on Saturday.

But Twitter users weren't only speculating on whether Assange was alive or dead - they believed they knew who his alleged killer was as well: A certain Baywatch blonde bombshell.

But many on Twitter took Anderson's words seriously - and they weren't laughing.

'Don't trust unconfirmed reports of Assange being alive. The Clinton machine is capable of body doubles,' wrote one user.

'ARREST PAMELA ANDERSON NOW', they added.

'GET ASSANGE OUT OF THERE AND INTO HIDING,' a user named Rosa Marzullo frantically tweeted to citizen journalist James Albury.

'How do we know that Pamela Anderson isn't working 4 (sic) someone to set him up?'

Roosh V, the controversial blogger who has called for the legalization of rape, tweeted out an article about Anderson bringing Assange lunch.

'If he's dead, I'd have that food tested,' he added.

Each tweet was then followed by a series of numbers and letters, causing many on the social media site to believe they were a 'dead man's switch' meant to be activated in case he is killed

But fashion designer Vivienne Westwood revealed on Sunday that Anderson had met with Assange to discuss a new trust she wants to set up.

'I was supposed to take Pamela Anderson to see Julian in the embassy but she got the date wrong, so she went on her own the day after me,' Westwood told the Mail On Sunday.

'She told me afterwards that they got on very well. Julian was just brilliant.'

'Pamela's trying to help people with her new trust and he gave her some ideas on how to do that.'"

221,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-china-idUSKBN15504D,newsbbc,"Chinese state media hopes for best with Trump, prepares for worst",['Reuters Editorial'],"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese state media on Saturday said that it hoped the new U.S. administration of President Donald Trump understood the importance of relations with China, but that Beijing should also prepare for the worst.

On the campaign trail, Trump railed against China, accusing it of stealing American jobs, and also angered Beijing by taking a call from the president of self-ruled Taiwan, which China views as a wayward province with no right to formal foreign ties.

While Trump made no direct mention of China in his inaugural address, he struck a defiant tone, saying American workers have been devastated by the outsourcing of jobs abroad.

In a front page commentary, the overseas edition of the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily said the two countries should not try to force each other into submission, but look for win-win cooperation and manage their disputes.

""The new U.S. government should realize that it's normal for these two great countries to have problems and disagreements. What is crucial is to control and manage disputes and find a way to resolve them,"" it said.

""China hopes the inauguration of the new U.S. president can be a new starting point for the development of China-U.S. ties,"" the paper said.

""The stable and healthy development of relations accords with the interests of both peoples, and is the common expectation of the international community.""

Sister paper the Global Times, an influential publication which often strikes a stridently nationalistic tone, noted that while Trump has said a lot about China, his actual policy has yet to take shape.

""Definitely, the Trump administration wants to boost exports to China and relocate factories from China back to the US. Taiwan will be merely a bargaining chip for them to put trade pressure on China,"" it said in an editorial.

The paper said Trump's China policy will hinge on how well he understands the overlapping interests of the world's two largest economies and whether he will be motivated enough to change the existing structure with force.

""Undoubtedly, the Trump administration will be igniting many 'fires' on its front door and around the world. Let's wait and see when it will be China's turn."""

226,http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/the-top-5-harmful-toxins-in-air/?a_aid=54e3fadc2316d,newsbbc,The Top 5 Harmful Toxins in Air,"['Kathrine Hansen', 'Ha Phan']","A major part of how healthy we are comes from how clean the air we breathe really is. Fumes and carcinogens from factories and automobile exhaust, and tons of other harmful gases are all around us. These are dangerous molecules to inhale, and they also decrease the actual amount of oxygen in the air. Now, consider this: most of our airborne toxins are inhaled while we’re inside because we spend most of our lives indoors whether it’s in offices, homes, schools, churches.

And since that’s where most of our time is spent – at home, in stores, restaurants and more, it’s important to be aware of what’s in that air you breathe most often: smoke, pet dander, paint fumes, mold, mildew and possibly billions of microorganisms.

Oxygen is the major component that the body uses to neutralize toxins and remove them from the body. The air we breathe is low in oxygen content when it is polluted with carcinogens; toxic factory and auto exhaust fumes, and many other things. We are suffocating. “Dirty” air presents less than adequate oxygen levels for your body to perform its tasks optimally. That means less oxygen and more toxins to the bloodstream, and the colon, which is responsible for eliminating toxins from your body.

There is very little chance that you or a group of you will make any significant changes in the way that factories burn off waste, or change the way that car manufacturers design their exhaust systems in a significantly short amount of time. Because most of your toxic molecules are inhaled while inside anyway, we are going to focus the top 5 toxins from indoor air.

1. Tobacco Smoke

Almost no one argues against the fact that cigarettes are bad. Not anymore, anyway. And unfortunately for us all, we now know that quitting doesn’t save us all. We know that there is danger in smoking. We are now attending to the secondhand smoke dangers as well. Secondhand smoke is a real problem that requires uncomfortable ways of living in order to compensate for it.

For many years smoking has been linked to lung cancer. It’s also been linked to colorectal cancer. Polyps become enlarged and irritated with secondhand smoke inhalation. The larger the polyp, the greater is the risk of it metastasizing into cancer. People are paying attention to the dangers of secondhand smoke. This awareness is the reason that you now experience ‘SMOKE FREE’ restaurants and workplaces and homes. When you inhale cigarette smoke, you are breathing in tar and other additives which are difficult to expel from your body. In the human body they can cause cancer, in children, there is the added danger of causing damage to their still-developing organs.

2. Paint Fumes

The dangers of lead and mercury added to paints have been assessed and addressed by eliminating them from paint formulas. Some paints on the market give off fumes called Volatile Organic Compounds which is unsafe for inhaling. Even with a high vapor pressure causing it to dissipate quickly, there are times when it is inhaled. Over time, the buildup of these VOC’s causes toxins to build up in the body which can lead to headaches, loss of coordination, liver damage and other disorders. You should know that there is a danger to breathing in these fumes even outdoors. However, the greater threat is indoors, which is why many paints come with the warning that you should use them only in well ventilated areas.

An even better solution is to buy paints that do not contain these compounds. Know too that the fumes don’t come only from some paints. The EPA has a long list of common products that emit these harmful fumes, such as, minerals, varnishes, enamels, lacquers, stains, latex, and water colors. It really would be an impossible task to eliminate the threat from all products that contain these volatile compounds. For that reason you should make the effort to reduce them in your home by using VOC-Free Paints.

3. Micro-Organisms

According to the EPA, biological contaminants are “living organisms or their derivatives,” and they include mold, mildew, bacteria, dust mites, animal dander and viruses. These organisms build up in the body to toxic levels and they can cause respiratory problems among other things. Children, elderly and people with weakened immune systems are especially susceptible to airborne biological contaminants.

4. Pet Dander

Pet dander is dead animal skin cells, reminiscent of human dandruff, which sloughs off naturally as the animal’s skin becomes dry. These skin cells are found in concentrated amounts around the animal’s sleeping area. Once airborne these particles can be inhaled or swallowed. It’s estimated that 30% of allergy sufferers are pet owners. So they definitely need to reduce the airborne particles from their pets.

5. Mold & Mildew

Mold is naturally occurring outdoors. It’s only natural that some of the spores will get into your home just as a matter of moving in and out. When they enter and begin to multiply then there is the danger of inhaling dangerous quantities. The threats from the spores of mold and mildew can include: respiratory ailments, headaches, nausea and diarrhea. Mold found in damp areas like bathrooms are generally referred to as mildew. These spores are unclean and unsightly. When you go in and scrub them away, you are actually making them airborne and that’s when there’s a chance that you will inhale them.

I highly recommend cleansing the air in your home with the REME+ advanced air purification unit. I also suggest regular lung cleansing with a product such as Allertrex®.

227,http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-attacks-clinton-for-foundation-pay-to-play-allegations-2016-10,newsbbc,Trump: The Clintons 'were willing to play fast and loose' with their Foundation,['Lisa Lerer'],"WASHINGTON (AP) — Seeking to lash Hillary Clinton to her husband's sprawling post-presidential empire, Donald Trump accused the couple of turning to corruption to enrich themselves while in public service.

On Thursday, the GOP nominee cited newly released emails from her campaign chairman's personal account showing Doug Band, a former Bill Clinton aide, describing overlapping relationships between the Clinton Foundation and the family's private gains.

""Mr. Band called the arrangement 'unorthodox.' The rest of us call it outright corrupt,"" said Trump at the first of three campaign rallies in Ohio. ""If the Clintons were willing to play this fast and loose with their enterprise when they weren't in the White House, just imagine what they'll do in the Oval Office.""

Band wrote the 2011 memo to defend his firm, Teneo, describing how he encouraged his clients to contribute to the foundation and get consulting and speaking gigs for Bill Clinton. Some of his work included obtaining ""in-kind services for the president and his family — for personal travel, hospitality, vacation and the like.""

The message was released by WikiLeaks after a hack by others of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's private email account.

""I think we've had enough of the Clintons, in all fairness,"" Trump said. ""Don't you think?""

Band called the business, ""Bill Clinton Inc."" — a term Trump referenced to paint the family as using their public profiles for personal gain, a line of attack Republicans have long tried.

The hacked emails, as well as recent news of an ""Obamacare"" premium hike, have appeared to hand Trump a pair of potent gifts in the campaign's final fortnight. But to the frustration of many in his party, Trump has struggled to stay on message, often turning to personal attacks against private citizens who he feels have wronged him, like the Gold Star family of a deceased Muslim-American solider.

Any newfound focus is coming late: Opinion polls indicate Clinton has a significant advantage in the race.

Her campaign is so comfortable with her position that she's begun expanding the scope of her campaign to help down-ballot Democrats — her party sees an opportunity to win control of the Senate and reduce its deficit in the House — and retool her campaign message to emphasize unifying the country after a divisive race.

A new Associated Press-GfK poll released Wednesday found Clinton on the cusp of a potentially commanding victory, fueled by solid Democratic turnout in early voting, massive operational advantages and increasing enthusiasm among her supporters.

The survey shows her leading Trump nationally by a staggering 14 percentage points among likely voters, 51-37. That margin is the largest national lead for Clinton among recent surveys. But other polls generally have shown her ahead of Trump for the past several weeks.

Clinton was unveiling a new policy plan aimed at reducing bullying at a campaign stop with Michelle Obama Thursday in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, marking the first joint appearance for the two first ladies on the campaign trail. Mrs. Obama's appearances have become a key part of Clinton's effort to fire up women, particularly black women for whom she's a model and a source of pride.

Clinton's plan would provide $500 million in new funding to states that develop comprehensive anti-bullying efforts. The campaign said states must address spoken and cyber bullying, establish a process for addressing incidents and ban bullying on the ""basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and religion.""

It would be paid for through Clinton's proposed tax increases on the wealthy.

The presidential candidates and dozens of outside groups involved in the race are also due to file their final major fundraising reports before Election Day. These documents will show fundraising and spending between Oct. 1 and Oct. 19_giving a sense of what resources each side had available as the campaign entered its frantic final stretch."

In Addition To Practicing Law', ""Stephen'S Passions Include Education"", 'Officiating Swimming On National']","On April 19th, Microsoft announced its new SQL 2017 server edition. While this product is, of course, not geared exclusively toward lawyers and law firms, there are implications for the legal profession based on what Microsoft says the new version of this product can do.

Microsoft has offered the SQL Server for several years. It is, in essence, a relational database management system. Since it is a database server, it is also a software product that can store and retrieve data requested by other software, which may run either on the same computer or on other computers across a network (including the internet).

Microsoft has provided new and improved data analytic tools that will enable analysis of all sorts of data in all sorts of ways across all sorts of different platforms.

Because of that, SQL can undertake analytics of data of various types. Over the years, Microsoft has developed and marketed at least a dozen different editions aimed at different audiences and workloads, although none of these have been specifically directed toward lawyers or the legal profession.

This year’s edition offered three new significant improvements:

In a growing trend for Microsoft to make its products more available and usable to iOS people, SQL can now be used with Linux-based platforms like iOS. This is good news for Apple users that want to use the product or who interact with hardware on which SQL runs.

SQL 2017 introduces a new and faster migration tool. It has reduced migration to five or six steps, which means you can quickly move large databases from one place to another. Microsoft also introduced elements that improve abilities to move databases to the cloud and back again.

SQL 2017 promises to offer such time-saving tools as face recognition and cognitive services, designed to make the platform easier and faster.

However, it is what Microsoft promises SQL 2017 will now do on the analytics front that’s intriguing, and which may ultimately affect legal tech. Microsoft has provided new and improved data analytic tools that will enable analysis of all sorts of data in all sorts of ways across all sorts of different platforms. This will extend SQL Server’s use in analytics: Microsoft is touting that SQL 2017 will offer artificial intelligence tools and deep and adaptive learning systems to provide even more in-depth and tailored analysis. This will allow the system to do such things as make predictions and calculate probabilities of events based on data. According to Microsoft, SQL 2017 is the first commercial database that has built-in deep learning and artificial intelligence.

Could SQL 2017, with the right data, predict such things as the chances of a jury verdict or court ruling?

The analytics and AI functions in SQL 2017 could enable law firms and in-house departments to make improved decisions and perform better analysis. Industries that use and depend on legal services can make both quantitative and qualitative assessments about such things as the value added by outside counsel. Insurance companies, for example, have for many years collected and tried to use and compare data about the time spent by lawyers to review and analyze legal bills. Whether SQL 2017 might be a better and easier to use tool for these functions remains to be seen. But since this is the year that many firms, in-house departments and legally related businesses are reviewing their Microsoft products and moving to such things as Office365 and Azure, SQL 2017, with its improved AI and deep learning capabilities, may be attractive.

But the really intriguing thing about SQL 2017 is the potential use of the software to analyze data and make predictions in law. Could SQL 2017, with the right data, predict such things as the chances of a jury verdict or court ruling? Could it better examine billing rates and trends and success rates of lawyers? Or perhaps it could help do a deep dive on the proclivities of appellate judges to predict opinions better.

Given the vast amount of businesses and governmental systems using Microsoft in one form or another, including SQL Server, the potential data stream housed on Microsoft servers and available to be analyzed could be huge. And the opportunity for combining data from various sources into a super-database that allows the application of AI and analysis promised by Microsoft could be quite significant to the legal profession.

SQL 2017—if it does what Microsoft says—could open up increased data analytics and AI for lawyers and those who use lawyers.

Microsoft has always been a player in document storage and cloud computing, which indirectly affect the practice of law. Granted, Microsoft has not previously participated directly in the legal space in a significant way. But in the past year, Microsoft has been injecting itself more and more in legal tech, such as committing money to Legal Services Corporation to help build out legal service portals for low-income individuals. So, while not directed toward the legal profession, SQL 2017—if it does what Microsoft says—could open up increased data analytics and AI for lawyers and those who use lawyers.

This alone won’t allow Microsoft to move into the legal space in a big way. To do that, it would likely need to acquire a legal analytics startup or even a more mature company to increase its role. And it would likely need to invest in a team of lawyers and technologists to make it happen. It must also get lawyers to move more data into Azure, its cloud platform, than what it has managed so far. Whether Microsoft wants to make this kind of investment remains to be seen, but the advances in SQL 2017 could be a good start."

Between now and Election Day on Nov. 8, WikiLeaks is expected to release more than 40,000 more emails about Clinton that are meant to damage her run for the White House — possibly in batches on a near-daily basis.

ADVERTISEMENT

The emails, from hacks of the Democratic National Committee and Clinton confidante John Podesta’s email account, may be the best chance Republican presidential nomineehas of knocking off Clinton, the Democratic nominee and heavy favorite to win the White House.

That makes WikiLeaks founder Assange one of 2016’s biggest wild cards.

Assange appears to relish the role.

“He has become which is what I think he always wanted to be: an alternative statesman,” said Daniel Domscheit-Berg, a former spokesperson from the organization’s early days.

“He’s not officially elected, but he’s involved in the highest level of political debate. He can have an influence on the U.S. election. It doesn’t really get much bigger than this.”

Assange has repeatedly vowed to release information expected to be damaging to Clinton, and on Thursday made public the sixth installment of material allegedly stolen from Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chairman.

The WikiLeaks Twitter account, believed to be manned by Assange, vacillates daily between defending the organization against detractors and promoting damaging stories about Clinton — some of which border on conspiracy theory.

It rarely touches on Trump, and Assange in interviews has been cagey about his support of the business mogul. Trump confidante Roger Stone has repeatedly claimed contact with Assange, telling CBS Miami Wednesday that he has “a back channel communication” with Assange via a mutual friend with whom he dined as recently as last week.

U.S. intelligence last week publicly blamed the Russian government for the hack on the DNC and other political organizations, leading many to question whether WikiLeaks is now an agent of Moscow.

“Media needs to stop treating WikiLeaks like it is same as FOIA. Assange is colluding with Russian government to help [GOP nominee Donald Trump],” Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon tweeted Monday, referring to the Freedom of Information Act.

Suspicion that Assange might be acting at the behest of the Russian government gained steam in 2012 when he briefly hosted a talk show on RT, a Kremlin-backed news network.

But Domscheit-Berg and others tracking Assange’s organization say they doubt he is taking orders from Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“I’m leery of attributing Assange as being directly supported [by Russia]. I think it’s fair to say that in furthering his own agenda, he is willing to be a tool of the Russians,” said Nicholas Weaver, a senior researcher at the International Computer Science Institute.

Weaver and others have long warned that WikiLeaks has no compunction about publishing information stolen by foreign intelligence agencies who want to use the group as a bullhorn to damage another government — or another political party.

“For Russia, WikiLeaks is more like a useful idiot because they are too cowardly and dumb to be in on the master plan,” a U.S. official told The Daily Beast — one of several who told the publication that WikiLeaks is merely the beneficiary of stolen documents, not the architect.

Assange has pushed back on accusations that he is colluding with the Russian government, tweeting that “Democrat-aligned journalists threw the facts out the window to make a Russian conspiracy about WikiLeaks & Trump.”

In interviews over the summer, Assange claimed to also have some material on Trump, but “from a point of view of an investigative journalist organization like WikiLeaks,” it was “hard for us to publish much more controversial material than what comes out of Donald Trump’s mouth every second day.”

The Hill reached out to WikiLeaks for this story but did not receive a response.

It’s unclear why Assange has such a grudge against Clinton, though it appears to be rooted in part in the prosecution of former Army Pvt. Chelsea Manning for the leak of hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables during Clinton’s tenure at the State Department.

In a June 12 interview on British TV, the Australian-born Assange argued against a Clinton presidency based on his ""personal perspective.”

He said Clinton is one of the main U.S. officials pushing to punish him for the release of the Manning cables.

At the time, Clinton called the publication “an attack on the international community.”

Manning is currently serving a 35-year prison sentence. Assange has not been charged.

“We do see her as a bit of a problem for freedom of the press more generally,” Assange said.

In February, Assange, who is living in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and is avoiding a rape charge in Sweden he claims is politically motivated, published an editorial on WikiLeaks calling Clinton a “war hawk with bad judgment who gets an unseemly emotional rush out of killing people.”

“She shouldn't be let near a gun shop, let alone an army. And she certainly should not become president of the United States,” he wrote.

Shortly after Clinton, sick with pneumonia, staggered leaving a Sept. 11 memorial event this year, the account tweeted a public poll inviting users to speculate whether she had an allergy problem, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis or head injury complications.

WikiLeaks later deleted the tweet shortly thereafter, saying that “the possibilities are too speculative.”

For some former employees who believed in WikiLeaks’s stated mission of transparency, the attacks on Clinton have been deeply demoralizing.

Domscheit-Berg and others left the organization over concerns that Assange’s autocratic grip over the organization had led him to use it as a platform to promote his own agenda, not root out abuses of power.

WikiLeaks “has no board, no governance, and no effective rules. In such a febrile environment, and with Julian so central to the organisation's ability to function, it's not hard to see how such decisions came to be seen as correct,” wrote former employee James Ball, who defected in 2011.

“He likes using the material he’s publishing, and he’s mixing this with his own personal views,” said Domscheit-Berg."
231,http://yournewswire.com/ron-paul-cia-meddled-in-hundreds-of-elections/,newsbbc,Ron Paul: CIA Meddled In ‘Hundreds’ Of Elections,[],"While the US continue to blame Russia for interfering in the US election, it seems the CIA are the experts when it come to meddling in other country’s elections.

Former presidential candidate Dr. Ron Paul said that US government “propagandists” push for a foreign policy of “intervening around the world”

After Hillary Clinton blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for personally directing a cyberattack that cost her the 2016 presidential election, Dr. Paul shrugged off the allegations as a “fiasco” in an interview for RT where he discusses “fake news” and more

RT reports:

“I think they’re just agitating, because they lost the election. They’re throwing out accusations and they have no proof,” the former Republican congressman for Texas said.

“The same people who are making all these charges, they didn’t seem to be worried a bit by the secretary of state having a private server,” Paul said, “which made it much easier for Russia or anybody else to know what was going on.”

Paul, a libertarian advocate of a foreign policy of non-intervention, went on to explain that ideally, the US should not have to worry about any other country having an incentive to interfere in US elections. The root of the problem, Paul believes, is in the US government doing the exact thing it now accuses Russia of doing.

“The American people should be worried about the influence of our CIA in other people’s elections, I mean probably hundreds. It’s constant,” he said, even going as far as to allude to “domestic assassinations” the CIA has allegedly taken part in.

Paul then brought his two points together in describing a sort of shadow government in cahoots with the major media, saying that the anti-Russian narrative was being promulgated in order to “amplify the arguments between Republicans and Democrats,” which he discounted as political theater.

“Our government doesn’t change a whole lot,” Paul explained. “The people, who behind the scenes control the government, are always the same. And I consider that to be the case in most governments.”

“The propagandists are on the side of the people who want us to be intervening around the world, and I imagine that because Trump has suggested maybe we ought to do a little bit less of that, maybe they don’t like that idea, and they want to discredit him for that approach,” Paul said.

Moving to the matter of “fake news,” another controversial issue heating up after the November election result, Paul was asked about Facebook unrolling a new policy of fact-checking, potentially pushing down news stories in its News Feed.

“If it’s a private organization,” Paul said, “they have a right to monitor. And they probably will make mistakes, but that is so much different than when a company like Facebook works with the government. That’s where the real danger is.”"

If music improves cognitive functions, it is reasonable to believe you can reap those same rewards, leading to increased performance and efficiency at work. Increased efficiency means you get things done quicker. Finishing earlier means you have increased free time to put towards another assignment or to spend relaxing.

Music Increases Cognitive Function: Several studies have shown cognitive improvements in those who listened to classical music prior to performing certain tasks or taking tests. Functions that demonstrated in increase in capacity included: Language skills, reading skills, spatial tasks, verbal communications, quantitative abilities, concentration, memory, and motor skills.

Several studies of students preparing to take the SAT test compared test scores of those who listened to classical music prior to taking the test with those who did not. Those who preceded the test with classical music scored higher on the SAT than the students who did not.

A study by the University of Washington showed that copyeditors who listened to classical music for 90 minutes while editing copy found 21% more mistakes than those who did not.

Improved Interpersonal Relations through Music: Listening to music not only improves functions within your brain, but music has also been shown to have a profound effect on mood. The style of music correlated with the mood experienced by the listener.

Those who listened to music that was considered positive or upbeat were asked questions about their impressions of other people, and these individuals generally responded in a positive manner. Likewise, those who listened to music that was considered sad or depressing, and then were asked to form impressions of the same people as the first group, generally responded in a negative manner.

This suggests that listening to music can have a profound effect on the way people view life and on their success in maintaining interpersonal relations. If listening to music that is considered positive or upbeat improves overall mood, it stands to reason that life will be viewed in a more favorable manner, and the listener will experience greater success in his relationships.

Success in work and life can rely largely on our approach to each. With an improved outlook and a happier mood, we can achieve much more than if we proceed with negativity.

Music and Healing: Researchers have studied the effects of music on patients that have had strokes, have epilepsy, or suffer from developmental disabilities. Those who had strokes were able to regain speech and language abilities much faster and more completely when music was incorporated into their recovery. Epileptics – even those in a coma – who were exposed to music showed a reduced incidence of seizures. Autistic children who had difficulty expressing themselves began showing great improvements once music was incorporated into their therapy.

Evidence continues to surface reinforcing music’s positive impact on not only the human brain, but on overall health and well being. In addition to stimulating the mind, classical music can calm and soothe, thereby reducing stress. Stress is one of the biggest causes of illness, so it stands to reason that by reducing the amount of stress your body experiences, the healthier it will be. And the healthier you are, the more likely you are to achieve your goals.

Companies Coordinate Song & Learning: As the benefits of incorporating music into our lives become more and more apparent, many universities, companies, and large corporations have begun including music in their training programs.

The Shell Corporation, DuPont, and IBM, among others, have begun using classical music to compliment corporate training programs. The results have shown participants learn new material in about half the time and demonstrate increased retention.

Improve Your Performance With Music: Music stimulates parts of the mind in ways never thought possible, having far reaching effects on brain function. Whether a temporary improvement caused by an increase in arousal or improvement in mood, or an actual raising of mental ability caused by neuron stimulation deep within the brain, you can incorporate music into your life to help you reach your goals faster and more easily.

Making this one simple change is easy to do, yet can potentially have widespread benefits. Any increase in cognitive ability will help you complete your work more quickly and accurately, providing a positive impact on your career. Increased efficiency will provide you with more free time, which in turn can help you better achieve work life balance. Not to mention the positive change in mood, which gives you a happier outlook on life as a whole. So turn up the Mozart, and see where the music takes you.

Bush paintings and recently claimed to have hacked Hillary Clinton's email server.

In the interest of transparency, and to let readers judge for themselves, we decided to publish the full chat log. We kept the parts in Romanian, adding the English translation, according to Google Translate.

Motherboard: So, first of all, what can you tell me about yourself? Who are you?

Guccifer 2.0: i'm a hacker, manager, philosopher, women lover. I also like Gucci! I bring the light to people. I'm a freedom fighter! So u can choose what u like!

I hacked that server through the NGP VAN soft, if u understand what I'm talking about.



So that was your entry point, what happened next?

I used 0-day exploit of NGP VAN soft then I installed shell-code into the DNC server. it allowed me to intrude into DNC network. They have Windows-based domain architecture. then I installed my Trojans on several PCs. I had to go from one PC to another every week so CrowdStrike couldn't catch me for a long time. I know that they have cool intrusion detection system. But my heuristic algorithms are better.



When did you first hack them?

Last summer.

And when did you get kicked out?

June 12, when they rebooted their system.



And why did you hack the DNC in the first place?

DNC isn't my first deal.

Who else have you hacked?

Follow my blog and u'll know! I can't tell u now about all my deals. My safety depends on it.

OK, I understand. But why did u target DNC? why are you interested in them?

Lazar began this deal and I follow him! I think we must fight for freedom of minds, fight for the world without Illuminati

As its first step, the LSC’s portal project will create pilot websites in one or two states, with the aim of creating a template that can be replicated elsewhere. Pro Bono Net, a nonprofit that promotes innovative uses of technology to increase access to justice, will also work with Microsoft and LSC. “The current system of accessing legal services is confusing, opaque and inefficient for many people,” said LSC president James Sandman in a statement. “The goal of the portals is to simplify the process by providing a single, statewide point of access to effective help for people needing civil legal assistance.”

While this may seem somewhat attenuated or small in scope, it is important to remember that access to justice only works when people can easily find resources. A patchwork of government services, courts, non-profits, and private corporations can be prohibitively hard to navigate. LSC says that it hopes to have the first programs up and running within two years."

239,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pence-asia-japan-idUSKBN17L066,newsbbc,Pence says working with allies to put pressure on North Korea,['Roberta Rampton'],"TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Wednesday that Washington would work with its allies and China to put economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea but added that America would defeat any attack with an ""overwhelming response"".

Pence arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday from South Korea and reassured Japan of U.S. commitment to reining in North Korea's nuclear and missile ambitions in a series of meetings with Japanese leaders, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

Speaking aboard the USS Ronald Reagan, a Nimitz class aircraft carrier undergoing scheduled maintenance at its home port of Yokosuka, Pence said U.S. intentions remained unwavering in the face of the threat posed by the reclusive North, which has conducted a series of missile and nuclear tests in defiance of U.N. sanctions, most recently with a failed missile launch on Sunday.

""Those who would challenge our resolve or readiness should know, we will defeat any attack and beat any use of conventional or nuclear weapons with an overwhelming and effective American response,"" Pence said to loud applause, reiterating that all options are on the table in dealing with Pyongyang.

Pence made his remarks as the White House grappled with controversy over the location of the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier strike group that U.S. President Donald Trump said last week had been sent to near the Korean peninsula as a warning to North Korea, but which headed towards Australia instead.

Pence did not mention the Carl Vinson or the controversy.

Pence said he had spoken with Trump and by 2020 some 60 percent of the U.S. naval fleet would be in the region and Japan's role would grow.

""The United States will strengthen its presence in the Asia Pacific,"" he said. ""Japan will assume a larger role and responsibility in our alliance in the years ahead.""

Defence officials from the United States, South Korea and Japan, who were in Tokyo for trilateral security talks, said in a statement North Korea should give up its weapons development irrevocably.

""The officials call on North Korea to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs in a complete, verifiable, and irrevocably manner, to cease its provocative actions that only increase tensions in the region,"" they said.

'Serious Concern'

A senior North Korean official said in an interview with the BBC this week that North Korea would conduct missile tests ""on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis"", and any military action against it by the United States would prompt ""all-out war"".

North Korea's deputy representative to the United Nations, Kim In Ryong, accused the United States on Monday of creating ""a situation where nuclear war could break out an any time"" and said the North's next nuclear test would take place ""at a time and at a place where our headquarters deems necessary"".

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said all parties should make efforts to resolve the situation.

""China expresses serious concern with recent trends about North Korea's nuclear and missile development,"" he said.

The situation was tense and China was resolutely opposed to any words or actions that could further raise tension, he added.

North Korea regularly threatens to destroy Japan, South Korea and the United States and it showed no let-up in its belligerence after the failed missile test on Sunday, a day after putting on a huge display of missiles at a parade in Pyongyang.

Pence also said the United States would protect freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea, where Beijing is entangled in territorial rows with several Southeast Asia nations.

Pence heads for Indonesia later on Wednesday."
240,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-cabinet-richest-in-us-history-historians-say/,newsbbc,"Donald Trump's Cabinet richest in U.S. history, historians say",['Julianna Goldman'],"As he traveled the country on his thank you tour, President-elect Donald Trump touted his choices for his Cabinet and inner circle, a group historians say is the richest in U.S. history.

“And one newspaper criticized me, ‘Why can’t they have people of modest means?’” Trump said at a Des Moines, Iowa rally. “Because I want people that made a fortune. Because now they’re negotiating with you, okay?”

How rich? CBS News estimates seven of Trump’s picks are worth a combined $11 billion.

Betsy DeVos, nominated for secretary of education, comes from a family worth more than $5 billion; Linda McMahon, picked for small business administrator, has family wealth worth $1.2 billion; And Vincent Viola, the choice for Army secretary, is worth $1.77 billion.

“I guess they have a few poor millionaires on it, but mostly it’s billionaires,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Critics like Sanders say Trump’s choices fly in the face of his populist campaign message. “You don’t appoint a Cabinet of billionaires to be taking on the establishment,” he said on Sunday’s “Face The Nation.”

Steve Mnuchin, Trump’s Treasury pick has been estimated to be worth as much as $655 million. He and commerce secretary nominee Wilbur Ross, worth $2.5 billion, recently said they were attuned to the plight of working Americans.

“It’s also not true all jobs are created equal. A guy that used to work in the steel mill, now flipping hamburgers, he knows it’s not the same,” Ross said in an appearance on CNBC.

Having millionaire and billionaire cabinet secretaries is not unprecedented. They tend to attract slots at Treasury and Commerce. But neither President Obama nor President George W. Bush had a single billionaire in their first Cabinets."

It was taken on Saturday, four days after the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, described its mission in the Sea of Japan.

Now, the Carl Vinson is finally on a course for the Korean Peninsula, expected to arrive in the region next week, according to Defense Department officials. White House officials declined to comment on the confusion, referring questions to the Pentagon. “Sean discussed it once when asked, and it was all about process,” a spokesman, Michael Short, said of Mr. Spicer.

Privately, however, other officials expressed bewilderment that the Pentagon did not correct its timeline, particularly given the tensions in the region and the fact that Mr. Spicer, as well as the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, were publicly answering questions about it.

“The ship is now moving north to the Western Pacific,” the Pentagon’s chief spokeswoman, Dana White, said Tuesday. “This should have been communicated more clearly at the time.”

The miscues began on April 9 when the public affairs office of the Navy’s Third Fleet issued a news release saying that Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., the Pacific commander, had ordered the Carl Vinson, a Nimitz-class nuclear-powered carrier, and its strike force — two destroyers and one cruiser — to leave Singapore and sail to the Western Pacific. As is customary, the Navy did not say exactly where the carrier force was headed or its precise mission.

Given the timing, it hardly needed to: Mr. Trump had just wrapped up a two-day summit meeting with Mr. Xi at his Palm Beach club, Mar-a-Lago, with a message that the United States had run out of patience with North Korea’s dictator, Kim Jong-un, and its nuclear and missile programs.

That Sunday, General McMaster told Fox News that the deployment was a “prudent” move, designed to give the president “a full range of options to remove” the threat posed by Mr. Kim.

What the Navy did not say was that the Carl Vinson had to carry out another mission before it set sail north: a long-scheduled joint exercise with the Australian Navy in the Indian Ocean.

South Korean and Japanese news media, as well as The New York Times, reported Admiral Harris’s order as evidence that the crisis was intensifying. While an aircraft carrier is not the weapon of choice for a strike on North Korea — such an operation would more likely involve long-range bombers and cruise missiles — it sends a vivid message of military might.

In July 2010, President Barack Obama ordered the aircraft carrier George Washington to the Sea of Japan to intimidate the North after it had torpedoed a South Korean Navy corvette, killing 46 sailors. When his defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, asked him to reroute the carrier to the Yellow Sea, to send an additional message to Beijing, Mr. Obama resisted.

“I don’t call audibles with aircraft carriers,” he said, using a football metaphor to reject the midcourse correction.

By all accounts, Mr. Trump is less worried than Mr. Obama about making such calls on the fly. His aides have praised this unpredictability as a virtue in dealing with rogue leaders in North Korea and Syria.

In South Korea, though, fears of a full-blown war erupted. The government rushed to reassure the public that the Carl Vinson was coming only to deter North Korean provocations. April 15 is the birthday of Kim Il-sung, the nation’s founder and the grandfather of Kim Jong-un — an occasion the North typically uses to conduct celebratory weapons tests.

On April 11, Mr. Trump stoked the fears of military action with an early-morning Twitter post: “North Korea is looking for trouble. If China decides to help, that would be great. If not, we will solve the problem without them! U.S.A.” Later that day, Mr. Spicer was asked by a reporter, who assumed the Carl Vinson was on its way north, why the United States had decided to dispatch the carrier group to the Sea of Japan.

“A carrier group is several things,” Mr. Spicer replied. “The forward deployment is deterrence, presence.” He added, “I think when you see a carrier group steaming into an area like that, the forward presence of that is clearly, through almost every instance, a huge deterrence.”

Mr. Spicer did not point out that the Carl Vinson was not, in fact, steaming into the area and would not be for 14 more days. A senior administration official said the press secretary was using talking points supplied by the Pentagon. He was discussing the rationale for sending a carrier, this official said, not confirming the ship’s schedule.

An hour after Mr. Spicer left the podium, Mr. Mattis, the defense secretary, reinforced the perception of ships racing to the scene. Speaking at the Pentagon, he said the Navy disclosed the Carl Vinson’s itinerary in advance because the exercise with the Australians had been canceled. “We had to explain why she wasn’t in that exercise,” he said.

Mr. Mattis, however, had conflated two things: Admiral Harris had canceled only a port call for the Carl Vinson in Fremantle, Australia, according to Pentagon officials, because he feared that images of sailors on shore leave would be unseemly at a time when North Korea was firing missiles.

Navy officials said Admiral Harris never meant to suggest he was canceling the naval exercise. Organizing such exercises is a complicated effort that takes months. One official described it as a high-end exercise, raising the possibility that the two navies practiced scenarios to counter China, or tested new missile defenses or cyberoperations.

Some officials expressed irritation with Admiral Harris, saying he did not think through the consequences of announcing the deployment of an aircraft carrier during a period of high tension.

Mr. Mattis sent mixed signals about the mission. He stressed the need for the Navy to operate freely in the Pacific but added, “There’s not a specific demand signal or specific reason why we’re sending her up there.”

After a week of war drums, fueled by the reports of the oncoming armada, tensions subsided when the weekend passed with only a military parade in Pyongyang and a failed missile test.

Then, on Monday, the Navy posted the photo of the Carl Vinson, bristling with fighter jets as it passed Indonesia. It was spotted by Defense News, a trade publication, which broke the news that the ship was thousands of miles from where most of the world thought it was."

243,http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/benefits-of-water-for-your-body/?a_aid=54e3fadc2316d,newsbbc,Water: The Foundation of a Healthy Body,[],"The human body is a machine designed to run on water and minerals. The body is about 72% water and water is vitally important for every important bodily function. The bottom line is that without water, your body doesn’t work, and the quality of the water you consume can have a dramatic impact on your health.

A Crucial Element to Good Health

The human body has tremendous healing abilities and water is a major component. With proper nourishment and hydration, the body instinctively strives to be young and healthy, working to repair and rebuild bone, regenerate and replace tissue, and attack hostile organisms. In each of these miraculous processes there is one common factor — water.

How Hydration Affects Your Brain and Mental Health

The brain consists of over 75% water and controls nearly every one of the body’s processes by sending and receiving electrical signals through the nervous system. [1] Tiny messengers called “transporter proteins” travel at the speed of light to carry life giving messages to every cell and organ. Like any communication network, the purity of the carrier affects the speed and clarity of the signal. If the fluid, mostly water, inside of nerves is laced with traces of chemicals or toxic metals, the result is a delayed and distorted signal. Many experts believe signal distortion is linked to nervous system disorders like ADD, chronic fatigue syndrome, Alzheimer’s, and mood imbalance. [2]

How Hydration Affects Energy Levels

Water consumption directly affects energy levels. Just a 5% drop in body fluids can cause a 30% reduction in energy; the problem is not uncommon. By some estimates, two-thirds of the population suffers from some degree of chronic hydration. Rather than drink more water, many people turn to stimulants like caffeine and sugar to artificially boost their energy, quickly leading to a downward spiral. Caffeine and sugar are diuretics and cause your body to lose water, resulting in a further loss of energy and a dependency on artificial energy.

Water for Detoxing

The body’s detoxification system is major component to good health and relies heavily on adequate hydration. Filtering and flushing out toxins is very water intensive. It’s just another one of the reasons that staying hydrated has a tremendous impact on health.

How Much Water Do We Need?

We’ve all heard that eight glasses of water each day is an absolute minimum for the body to maintain basic functions. Every time you exhale, blink an eye, or make a movement, water is used. Even the beating of your heart requires water. Keep in mind that eight glasses is the minimum and one half your body weight in ounces is a better measuring stick (for example, if you weigh 180 pounds, drink 90 ounces of water per day).

How to Make Dr. Group’s Toxin-Free “Super Water”

A lot of public drinking water systems have contaminants you’re better off avoiding; drinking purified or distilled water is key. To add a boost to your water, or if you’re drinking distilled water and want to add back some of the minerals lost during the distillation process, try the following recipe.

One gallon distilled or purified water, preferably stored or purchased in a glass container. Add two to three tablespoons of raw, organic apple cider vinegar. If the taste is too strong, reduce to one tablespoon. Optional: Add the juice of one half organic lemon and 1-2 ounces organic aloe vera per gallon of water.

'Ye even took a crack at sparking a devil-friendly trending topic.

""#DoyouthinkLucifer uses in in ear monitors or signature Beats by Dre headphones???!!!"" Yeezy wrote.

The MC did say he was cool with legendary hip-hop spinner and producer DJ Clue, who's known for lacing many of his projects with a chant that sounds similar to Illuminati.

""I am down with Cluemanotti though,"" he wrote. ""That's my boy.""

Yeezy joked about claims that he's down with the devil on Twitter, but he has also recently addressed one of his lyrics that may have riled up fans. In a sit-down with MTV News after the premiere of ""Runaway,"" broke down the meaning of a rhyme from a freestyle he kicked last year that lit up the blogosphere.

""There's this line where I say, 'I sold my soul to the devil, that's a crappy deal,' and all these people said, 'What you mean you sold your soul to the devil?' But when I say it, I'm saying, when I allow other people's ideals to interfere with what I know is true to myself, that's the devil,"" West explained. ""So, it's like, people talking mess on the blogs is the devil or ...trying to call me names, that's what the devil is. And me thinking twice about what it is that's really in my heart because of what people's reaction would be is me selling my soul to the devil.""

The lyricist maintained that he will no longer let others' opinions stifle his creative expression.

""You're on earth for only 80, 90 a hundred years,"" he said. ""I have to create from my dreams, from the dreams I had as a 5-year-old, and use everything — all the greatest people and all the tools I have around me — and ask as many questions as I can to help facilitate and bring this out. And this [film] is one of the first examples of a dream coming true.""

Yeezy isn't the only hip-hop star to catch heat about a visual supposedly packed with satanic imagery. Jay-Z and Swizz Beatz batted away rumors, earlier this year, that the slick video for their collabo ""On to the Next One"" was riddled with demonic references.

What do you think about the rumors about Kanye West? Let us know in the comments!"
245,http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/6-health-benefits-of-eating-organic-food/?a_aid=54e3fadc2316d,newsbbc,6 Health Benefits of Eating Organic Food,[],"Agribusiness is all about profits, not your health. It is an industry that has developed a system of food production that’s completely forgotten what food is all about: nutrition and health — not to mention taste. It’s gotten so bad that it’s becoming difficult to even call the stuff that agribusiness produces food. It would be more honest if they were to call it “stuff for ingestion” and include a warning label.

The voice of those of us who are not interested in what’s now called “conventional” farming is ever increasing. We’re not interested in consuming chemicals, toxins, or GMOs. What are we interested in? Organic food. Why? It’s better. Here’s a quick list of six reasons why you should make it a point to consume organic whenever possible.

1. No GMOs

Genetically modified organisms, including GM foods, are a horrible mutation of real food. The claim that GMOs are just like any other method of improving foods is simply nonsense. Never before have genetics been manipulated by taking the genes from one species and inserting them into another.

Animal genes are spliced into plants, and plant genes into animals, something that cannot happen in nature. The claims that GMOs and breeding are virtually identical and safe are clearly nonsense, with studies like the one done by Gilles-Eric Séralini showing that rats fed a diet of Roundup-Ready GM corn developed massive tumors and died younger. [1]

Although other countries in the world have rightfully shut the door on GMO junk being sold within their boundaries, organic foods are the only foods that people in America can be reasonably sure are GMO-free!

2. Better Nutrition

Conventionally grown “stuff for ingestion” is produced in played-out soil under the delusion that all the nutrients you require can be replaced by artificially-produced fertilizers. There is a fallacy that bigger and prettier produce is synonymous with healthy produce. The fact is that study after study has proven that organic food is more nutritious. By the way, more nutritious food usually tastes better, too.

Here are some nutrient facts reported by Organic.org: [2]

One study showed that organic fruits and veggies contain 27% more vitamin C, 21.1% more iron, 29.3% more magnesium, 13.6% more phosphorus, and 18% more polyphenols.

Salicylic acid is an important and health-promoting substance. Researchers have found that there is an average of 600% more salicylic acid in organic soups, and that organic carrot and coriander soup contains 1,040 nanograms of it, compared with only 20 nanograms in typical nonorganic soups!

Organic meats are less fatty, and the fats are healthier.

The only US beef that has been free of the fatal prion brain disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob, is organic.

The science is clear: organic food is more nutritious.

3. No Pesticides or Herbicides

Pesticides and herbicides are poison. It’s that simple. Their function is to poison things. Food that’s grown with the use of pesticides and herbicides are, therefore, poisonous. Don’t kid yourself into believing that you can effectively wash it off. You cannot. For lack of better words, it’s in all the nooks and crannies. It’s taken up by the roots and soaked in when it’s sprayed. Nearly all pesticides function by harming the nervous system. So, if you eat foods that were grown by agribusiness, you are eating neurotoxins and gradually poisoning your nervous system. [3]

The way to avoid these poisons is to eat only organic foods.

4. Higher Quality Meat and Dairy

When you see studies claiming that meat is bad for you, take note that they never distinguish between organic husbandry and the stuff that comes from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). If you eat most of the stuff sold for ingestion that supermarkets sell, then you should pay attention because that stuff is truly bad for you. It’s loaded with antibiotics and other drugs, and it is, frankly, dirty. Animals raised wallowing in their own feces and the stench of old urine are not healthy. If you eat meat that comes from such places, you’re not helping your health. [4]

If you’re going to eat meat, the way to avoid such cruelty to animals and unhealthy meat is simple: Eat only organic and free range meats.

5. Less Chance of Food-Borne Illness

The news media keeps reporting about massive outbreaks of food-borne illness. Cabbage. Eggs. Fast food restaurants. Spinach. Melons. Peanut butter. The list goes on and on. The more our foods are produced by agribusiness, the more such outbreaks happen.

What the news media fails to report is that virtually every one of these outbreaks is a direct result of agribusiness. Animals in CAFOs are sick. No matter how much they’re vaccinated or drugged, they just get more sick. Factory farms are the primary source of drug-resistant infections. In fact, they were the first source. E. coli was not even considered an infectious bacterium until around 1983. It’s a necessary probiotic found in everyone’s gut. It’s necessary for digestion. The E. coli that causes deadly infections is a mutant caused by CAFOs. [5]

The best way to be safe from food-borne illness is to choose organic foods. The insane rush to sterilize our foods and farms simply makes us less healthy, and ultimately results in exposure to the worst food-borne illnesses that have ever existed.

6. Better for Your Conscience

By now, it’s clear that the stuff for ingestion sold by most supermarkets is devastating for our health, devastating for the animals raised for this travesty, and devastating to the environment. So, my final health benefit of eating organic is your conscience.

When you’re aware of the devastation brought by agribusiness to animals and the environment, surely your conscience suffers-and the fact is that a bad conscience is bad for your health. So do yourself a huge favor — make organic food as big a part of your diet as possible. Not only will your health benefit, but so will the rest of the world. In fact, it may be the most important action you ever take.

246,http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2016/10/04/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-fabricated/,newsbbc,"Kim Kardashian, Kanye West Could Face Criminal Charges Over Paris Robbery",[],"Kim Kardashian, Kanye West Could Face Criminal Charges Over Paris Robbery

Was it all made up? Strangely, no surveillance footage has been found, despite reports of a robbery involving five people. Now, French officials may be wondering if Kim Kardashian and Kanye West fabricated the entire thing.

Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are masters of the publicity stunt, but the pair may have gone too far last weekend in Paris. Yesterday, Digital Music News raised a number of glaring problems with the reported jewelry heist, including the possibility that the story was completely fabricated.

It just doesn’t seem to pass the sniff test. And that could be a big, big problem for French officials desperately trying to repair the image of Paris.

Among the obvious problems are the absence of any security the night of the heist, the presence of just one night watchman in the entire hotel, an immediate escape by Kardashian and the watchman despite being tied up, and the absence of even one message to the outside (including from another person downstairs in the multi-level suite).

No security footage captured.

But this one may just take the cake. According to details somehow ‘leaked’ to TMZ, there isn’t any security footage of the crime. Somehow, a five-person crew managed to evade every single camera, either inside the hotel or outside the building. At this point, no other cameras have recorded anything, even though Paris is littered with cameras on every block.

In fact, one police surveillance camera outside the building shows zero activity. That could be because it was pointed away from the building, or, perhaps there was absolutely nothing to record.

Additionally, there isn’t one witness to the crime outside Kim Kardashian and the unidentified night watchman. Fashion stylist Simone Harouche, who called the cops after allegedly hearing screams from Kardashian on the hotel balcony, has declined to comment.

Back in the US, even Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer is raising questions about the heist. Opining about a separate case, Breyer referenced “Kardashian’s thief, if there is one.”

No leads, no suspects, no nothing .

More importantly, French police seem to have absolutely no leads in this case. Nobody saw anyone riding a bicycle in a police uniform, or even walking away. Not one witness has come forward, if a witness even exists. In fact, not one individual has even been detained, with French police failing to name one suspect.

All of which raises the possibility of a criminal probe ahead by French authorities. For starters, Paris is a city suffering billions in losses from slumping tourism, thanks to a spate of horrific terrorist attacks. Add a complicated jewelry heist into the mix, and the world’s most visited city could suffer another plunge in tourism.

French authorities may be considering a serious criminal investigation, if only to prove to the world that Paris is safe to visit.

Ryan Lochte, anyone?

Strangely, Kardashian’s reported heist bears an uncanny resemblance to a recent robbery wise tale. During the recent Olympics in Rio, American swimmer Ryan Lochte claimed that robbers dressed as police officers accosted him with guns. That story was widely accepted by the mainstream media, though Brazilian officials smelled a rat.

For starters, the Rio ‘robbers’ decided not to steal an expensive watch, among other glaring inconsistencies. Soon, video footage revealed that Lochte and team were merely vandalizing a gas station bathroom while drunk, while urinating outside a locked door. The ‘robbers’ were actually security guards trying to control the situation.

Ultimately, Lochte was shamed for cooking up a story and almost damaging the reputation of Rio. Could Kim Kardashian and Kanye West be guilty of the same crime?

More as this develops."

251,http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/china-must-expand-nuclear-arsenal-in-response-to-trump-global-times,newsbbc,China must expand nuclear arsenal in response to Trump: Global Times,[],"BEIJING (AFP) - China must strengthen its nuclear arsenal to ""force the US to respect it"" in response to the stance of new US President Donald Trump, a leading newspaper said Tuesday (Jan 24).

The comments in the Global Times, a popular paper known for its inflammatory rhetoric and hawkish views, came just days after President Xi Jinping called for the eventual global elimination of atomic weapons.

In recent days, Chinese social media has carried pictures purporting to show an advanced intercontinental ballistic missile system deployed in the northeast.

The Dongfeng-41 is reportedly a nuclear road-mobile missile thought to have a payload of 10-12 warheads and a range of 14,000km, according to the Global Times.

The paper, a subsidiary of the Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily, plays to nationalist sentiment and is often believed to channel hardline views within the government.

The Global Times said some media claimed the People's Liberation Army leaked the photos as a warning to Trump.

""They think this is Beijing's response to Trump's provocative remarks on China,"" it added.

The US president, who took office Friday, has rattled Beijing with tough talk on trade and national security.

On Monday White House spokesman Sean Spicer warned China the US would ""defend"" American and international interests in the disputed South China Sea, where China has built a series of artificial islands capable of military use.

""If those islands are, in fact, in international waters and not part of China proper, yeah, we'll make sure we defend international interests from being taken over by one country,"" he said.

Trump's nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, said last week China's access to the islands might be blocked - raising the prospect of a military confrontation.

China lays claim to a vast stretch of the waterway within a so-called ""nine dash line,"" including waters claimed by several of its neighbours.

The Global Times said Trump had called repeatedly for a US nuclear arms build-up.

""Even Washington feels that its naval forces and nuclear strength are lacking, so how can China be content with its current nuclear strength when it is viewed by the US as its biggest potential opponent?"" it asked.

The paper said China's nuclear forces ""must be so strong that no country would dare launch a military showdown"" with it.

""China must procure a level of strategic military strength that will force the US to respect it."" The comments were in marked contrast to Xi's speech at the United Nations days earlier.

""Nuclear weapons should be completely prohibited and destroyed over time to make the world free of nuclear weapons,"" Xi said.

China has been a nuclear power since 1964.

The PLA has been flexing its muscles since Trump's election, showing off upgraded combat aircraft and new fighters. The country's only aircraft carrier entered the Taiwan Strait this month in a symbolic show of strength.

On Monday the PLA navy announced it had commissioned its fifth ""carrier killer"" guided-missile destroyer and delivered it to the North Sea Fleet.

The system is believed to be designed to deter the US Navy, which has the world's largest number of carriers."

In a breaking news story, we have received evidence that Obama and John Kerry did not require Irans leaders to sign the nuclear deal that his team negotiated with the regime, and the deal is not “legally binding,” his administration acknowledged.

Obama and Iran agreed that a legally binding deal would be strongly discouraged and disapproved of in the United States, so they wanted to skip the “legally binding” part and just give Iran everything they asked for if Iran promised not to use the nuclear weapons on countries.

In a non legally binding agreement, Iran was given:

Advertisement

A lift on $100 billion in sanctions.

They were paid more than $36 billion for “long overdue actions.”

Unlimited access to trade with Europe again.

A lift on the arms embargo. They can buy and sell weapons from anyone, anywhere, anytime they want to.

They are allowed to run “safety tests” on themselves.

They report “illegal actions” themselves to the U.N. Meaning, Iran will tell Obama and the U.N. if they are acting criminally or inappropriately.

What the United States got:

Anti-American propaganda videos where American sailors were captured and humiliated.

Iran has test-fired an illegal long-range missile on several occasions.

Iran detained dozens of Americans and held them until Obama paid them a ransom.

That is it. We got absolutely nothing. We armed a jihadi maniac with nuclear weapons and gave them everything they asked for.

There is a silver lining: The deal was never signed, so two things can occur.

First, Trump can rip the deal up on day one and we can place all of the restrictions and bans right back on Iran while forcing them to destroy their nuclear systems.

Second, this was a clear act of treason by Obama and Kerry, and they should be charged once Trump is in office. The United States labels Iran as the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism, so that means the United States is working with terrorists.

Under the “Stop Funding Terrorists Bill,” which is going to House floor next week, if Republicans vote to pass this, Obama and any other government agency or official that supplies terrorists can be charged with treason.

Would you support Donald Trump charging Obama and Kerry with treason for this horrendous deal that placed the entire world at risk?

256,http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/donald-trumps-new-attack-ad-896660,newsbbc,Donald Trump's New Attack Ad Features Bill Clinton Accuser Juanita Broaddrick,['Ryan Parker'],"The black and white spot runs for about 20 seconds and includes quotes from a 1999 interview on 'Dateline.'

On Monday, Donald Trump released over social media his newest attack ad against Hillary Clinton which focuses on her husband, former President Bill Clinton.

Along with the ad, the presumptive GOP presidential candidate asks: ""Is Hillary really protecting women?""

The black and white spot runs for about 20 seconds and features women's voices, including Juanita Broaddrick, who accused Bill Clinton of rape. Bill Clinton is shown with a cigar in his mouth. The ad ends with Hillary laughing and the words: ""Here we go again?""

In a Dateline NBC interview that aired in February 1999, Broaddrick talked about Clinton in 1978, then Attorney General of Arkansas, sexually assaulting her.

In a particularly emotional part of her interview, Broaddrick describes the aggressive way Clinton was allegedly kissing her while she was trying to ward off his advances.

""He starts to bite on my top lip and I try to pull away from him,"" Broaddrick said in the interview. This is the exact segment Trump uses in his new attack ad.

Broaddrick sued Bill Clinton in 1999 to stop the White House from keeping files on her in order to ""smear and destroy her reputation."" The suit was dismissed in 2001.

These days, Broaddrick uses Twitter — her account verified by multiple reporters — to criticize Hillary Clinton and continue to tell her story about the former president.

I was 35 years old when Bill Clinton, Ark. Attorney General raped me and Hillary tried to silence me. I am now 73....it never goes away. — Juanita Broaddrick (@atensnut) January 6, 2016

Thoroughly disgusting--Hillary's comments on rape. Shame on you, Hillary, shame on you!! — Juanita Broaddrick (@atensnut) September 15, 2015

Mr. Namazi had been in Tehran since September, when he was visiting from Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, where he lives. He had apparently intended the trip to be short. His passport was confiscated, said the people close to him, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because his arrest has not been officially announced.

Mr. Namazi’s relatives declined to comment. Officials at Crescent Petroleum did not respond to attempts to reach them by telephone and email for comment.

Mark Toner, a deputy spokesman for the State Department, issued a statement in response to queries about Mr. Namazi: “We’re aware of recent reports of the possible arrest in Iran of a person reported to have U.S. citizenship. We’re looking into these reports and don’t have anything further to provide at this time.”

The arrest coincided with increasingly shrill accusations by some members of Iran’s Parliament that one of the other imprisoned Iranian-Americans, Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post’s Tehran correspondent, heads a network of spies. Mr. Rezaian, arrested in July 2014, was convicted of espionage this month, but the details and his sentence have not been made public.

The Iranian authorities have also imprisoned Saeed Abedini, a Christian pastor, and Amir Hekmati, a Marine veteran. There had been hopes that all would be freed after the nuclear accord was reached.

Experts on Iranian politics said the reported arrest of Mr. Namazi was a signal of a possible backlash by opponents of the nuclear agreement in Iran. They view the accord as a nefarious way for Americans to gain influence in Iranian society.

“It’s not a good sign for those who want to open Iran to the West and the United States,” said Alireza Nader, an Iran specialist at the RAND Corporation in Washington.

Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has made clear in speeches and letters that in his view the nuclear agreement should not lead to more cooperation with the United States. In September, he called on the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps to “guard the Islamic Revolution,” and he warned that the United States was trying to “infiltrate” the country, politically and culturally.

Mr. Namazi, a graduate of Tufts University, moved between the United States and Iran, settling down in Tehran in the mid-1990s. He and some relatives started a successful consulting firm, Atieh Bahar, that advised Western oil and multinational companies.

After the 2009 re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose administration accused the company of having improper relations with Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former president and rival to Mr. Ahmadinejad, Atieh Bahar’s top leadership was ousted. Harassed by security forces, Mr. Namazi left Iran in 2009.

He returned for brief family visits after the 2013 election of Mr. Ahmadinejad’s successor, Hassan Rouhani, who had campaigned on a desire to have the Western economic sanctions on Iran eased. In September, The Daily Beast published a highly critical, anonymously written article about Mr. Namazi and his family.

The Daily Beast article, which friends of Mr. Namazi have said they believe was part of a campaign to incriminate him, said that he played a leading role in the National Iranian American Council. The group said in a statement on its website on Thursday that neither Mr. Namazi nor his family “have had any leadership or any other significant role.”"
258,http://www.trueactivist.com/donations-to-the-clinton-foundation-plummet-as-familys-political-clout-evaporates/,newsbbc,Donations To The Clinton Foundation Plummet As Family’s Political Clout Evaporates,"['Whitney Webb', 'True Activist']","Following her “shocking” loss in the recent US election, donations to Hillary Clinton's family foundation are drying up as her political career is effectively over.

During the recent US presidential campaign season, there was no shortage of controversy as both candidates were regularly embroiled in scandals regarding their financial dealings and other questionable acts. Wikileaks, through its releases of emails tied to Clinton insiders, focused much more attention on Hillary Clinton’s scandals as mountains of evidence began to emerge exposing the corruption inherent in her political career and her family’s “charitable” foundation. The Clinton Foundation became so controversial that it even made its way onto the presidential debate stage, with Clinton’s opponent and now-President Elect Donald Trump threatening to hire a special prosecutor to investigate the foundation’s financial dealings.

Some of the chief allegations surrounding the foundation was its facilitation of Clinton’s “pay-to-play” dealings that occurred while Clinton was both a private citizen and US Secretary of State. In one egregious example, the King of Morocco “donated” $12 million to the Clinton Foundation in return for a meeting with Hillary, ultimately resulting in a $157 million weapons deal for the African monarchy only a few months later. Though the Clintons have long maintained that the foundation is a simple, innocent charity not connected to political favors, new post-election evidence is painting a different picture.

With Clinton’s loss, her family is effectively out of politics and their reputation stained by the numerous scandals that appeared during the campaign. As the family’s political clout dries up, so to has their foundation’s donations, suggesting that these donations were not for charitable purposes and instead for political favors and access. Prior the election, the wealthy Norwegian government was previously the donation’s third largest donor after Australia and Saudi Arabia. Between 2007-2013, Norway donated around $5 million annually to the foundation. However, when Hillary’s decision to run for president was all but confirmed, Norway’s donations increased significantly to $15 million in 2014 and $21 million in 2015. Now, with Clinton out of power, Norway’s contributions to foundation have plummeted by 87%, totaling $2.6 million – less than half of their pre-election contributions.

Foreign governments aren’t the only ones seeking to distance themselves from the Clintons and their foundation. As the “pay to play” allegations began to surface overall donations to the foundation dropped 37% with major donors such as Samsung and ExxonMobil cutting their ties completely. Internal strife between Clinton insiders and Chelsea Clinton as well as a low rating from a charity watchdog were also likely contributing factors. In addition, Hillary Clinton’s private speech revenue has also suffered. In 2014, Clinton made a massive $3.6 million from private speeches alone. However, that figure has now fallen to $357,500. It seems the political fallout from Hillary’s loss and numerous scandals is having much more of an effect than was anticipated, which may explain her visibly strained appearance at her only post-election speech.

However, the Clintons aren’t likely to give up their empire of influence that easily. According to rumors, Chelsea Clinton is expected to run for a congressional seat in the near future, which would keep the Clinton “brand” alive to the chagrin of many Americans.

ONE week after Kim Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in Paris while her security guard Pascal Duvier was out of the picture, the reality star has been left by the guard again.

German born Pascal was spotted accompanying Kim’s husband Kanye West to his gig in Chicago, leaving Kim with their two children, ten-month old Saint and North, three, in Los Angeles.

Splash News 5 Concert goers said Kanye was in ‘good spirits’ a week on from his wife’s terrifying ordeal

Kanye previously left the concert halfway through his set in Chicago after he received news of the robbery.

The rapper told the crowd during his performance: “I can safely say that tonight is a victory,” he told the crowd at one point.

“If your dreams keep you up at night and your ideas keep you up at night then your vision will come alive.”

Pascal faced criticism after Kim was left unprotected at the couple’s base in the French capital.

While she slept, with her friend in another room in the multi million pound apartment, Pascal looking after Kim’s sisters Kourtney and Kendall in a Parisian nightclub.

Despite her terrifying ideal, Kim made sure no blame was laid at Pascal’s door with sources confirming he would continue working for the family.

“That I promise you... you messed with the wrong one.”

The robbery, which took place on 3 October, saw Kim bound and gagged and put into a bathtub, with reports later claiming the 35-year-old begged for her life - telling the armed robbers: “I have babies at home.”

The gang got away with £8.5 million worth of jewellery, including Kim’s engagement ring.

Following Putin’s remarks that Democrat’s and Clinton are losing in a most undignified manner, Trump commented that his remarks are “So true!”

“Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and Dems: “In my opinion, it is humiliating. One must be able to lose with dignity.” So true!” Trump tweeted.

Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and Dems: ""In my opinion, it is humiliating. One must be able to lose with dignity."" So true! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2016

The Economic Times reports:

At his annual news conference in Moscow yesterday, Putin said the Democrats “are losing on all fronts and looking elsewhere for things to blame”, The Washington Post reported.

“In my view, this, how shall I say it, degrades their own dignity. You have to know how to lose with dignity,” he said.

The Democratic party and the Clinton Campaign have been blaming Russian hacking into their emails and servers for their loss.

Outgoing US President Barack Obama has ordered an investigation into the alleged Russian interference in US presidential elections.

Putin criticised the Democrats for blaming him for their defeat.

“Outstanding figures in American history from the ranks of the Democratic Party would likely be turning in their graves. Roosevelt certainly would be,” Putin said.

“Trump understood the mood of the people and kept going until the end, when nobody believed in him… except for you and me,” he added.

Earlier yesterday, the Trump Transition Team released a letter from Putin to Trump in which he called for strong bilateral relationship.

“Serious global and regional challenges, which our countries have to face in recent years, show that the relations between Russia and the US remain an important factor in ensuring stability and security of the modern world,” Putin wrote.

“I hope that after you assume the position of the President of the United States of America we will be able – by acting in a constructive and pragmatic manner – to take real steps to restore the framework of bilateral cooperation in different areas as well as bring our level of collaboration on the international scene to a qualitatively new level,” said the Russian President.

“Please accept my sincere wishes to you and your family of sound health, happiness, well-being, success and all the best,” Putin wrote as per the unofficial translation of the letter released by the Presidential Transition Team.

Trump praised the letter, saying a “very nice letter from Vladimir Putin; his thoughts are so correct. I hope both sides are able to live up to these thoughts, and we do not have to travel an alternate path”."

On Friday the U.S. government formally accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations.

In a joint public statement the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said it was confident that Russia’s most senior officials had ordered the attacks.

According to the joint statement, “disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts.”

Breaking: Joint statement from intel director & homeland security attributing recent political hacks to Russian gov pic.twitter.com/W5XziuzI7X — Shane Harris (@shaneharris) October 7, 2016

The Mail Online reports:

The statement amounts to an accusation that Vladimir Putin ordered interference in the American political system.

It is impossible for such an explosive charge to have been made without authorization from President Obama.

The statement said: ‘The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.

‘We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia’s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.’

It added: ‘It would be extremely difficult for someone, including a nation-state actor, to alter actual ballot counts or election results by cyber attack or intrusion.

‘This assessment is based on the decentralized nature of our election system in this country and the number of protections state and local election officials have in place. States ensure that voting machines are not connected to the Internet, and there are numerous checks and balances as well as extensive oversight at multiple levels built into our election process.’

The statement comes just hours after Secretary of State John Kerry called for Russia to face a war crimes investigation over its actions in Syria “

Moscow dismissed Kerry’s words as “propaganda” intended to distract from US failure to implement the Syrian ceasefire agreement."

265,http://time.com/25150/rape-victims-talk-about-tweeting-their-experiences-publicly/,newsbbc,Is a Twitter Debate about Sexual Assault a Legitimate form of Healing?,[],"JoAnne Cusick was wearing a pink floral sundress and jelly sandals when she was sexually assaulted at the age of eight by a group of neighborhood boys. Believing that she was to blame, she kept the secret for nine years until she told a priest about the attack during confession. He assured her that she was innocent in the eyes of God, and the eyes of the world.

Twenty-eight years later, Cusick, now a 37-year-old nurse living in Colorado, shared that secret on social media joining hundreds of other victims who tweeted their stories of assault. These women (and a number of men) were responding to a simple question that went viral on Twitter Wednesday night asking victims what they were wearing when they were assaulted. Within hours, a long list of outfits—ranging from sweatshirts to pajamas to bathing suits—accompanied by stories of rape and assault filled Twitter feeds, replacing the normal news items and GIFs.

The huge response ignited a conversation on social media and blogs among victims and health professionals as to whether sharing stories on highly public, semi-anonymous social media forums could be a healthy step in the recovery process—a way to make those who've been assaulted feel less alone, less stigmatized and shamed. Or does sharing leave survivors open to online shaming and undermine a more traditional route of coping, like therapy?

The debate started when Christine Fox, a young woman who tweets under the handle @steenfox, got into an argument on Twitter with a follower who insisted that women who wear revealing outfits are at fault if they are sexually assaulted. Fox i nvited those on the social media network who had been victims of rape or sexual assault to tweet the outfits they wore at the time of the attack in hopes of convincing this man not to victim blame.

""I was trying to make him understand that it absolutely does not make a difference, and that the responsibility does not lie on women,"" she told The Root. Over the next several hours, Fox received hundreds of replies. With the users' permission, she retweeted stories as she received them.

The campaign of sorts took on another life when Adrienne Simpson from Philadelphia, who has never been a victim of sexual assault, saw the conversation on Twitter and thought that it could take on a new visual format. ""I am a marketer, so I think in campaigns and imagery,"" she tells TIME. ""I was thinking they need pictures with this because that's what's going to drive home the idea that you can have on corduroy pants and a camouflage shirt—there's nothing remotely sexual about that—and this can still happen to you.""

She created five images from the texts of five tweets that caught her attention: the camouflage shirt and cords a 15-year-old had been wearing; a school uniform (buttoned-up polo, knee-length khaki shorts) worn by a 13-year-old; a sundress a 19-year-old was wearing to Church on Sunday when she was raped by her 50-year-old minister; jeans and a hoodie for a 22-year-old girl who was acting as a designated driver at a party and whose soda was roofied; and—the one that got the most retweets all night—the Barney pajamas worn by a seven-year-old when she was raped.

She added a hashtag: #RapeHasNoUniform. “I think as a victim, when you speak out, you want it to matter. The bigger this gets, the more it matters. I think it should be an organized, public campaign.”

But without expecting attention or publicity, many just tweeted in the hopes of helping others. “[The assault] had nothing to do with anything I did. And I think hearing one survivor being able to say that is a good for people who may still be blaming themselves,” Cusick tells TIME. She has shared her story with friends before, and says she felt comfortable opening up on Twitter.

Sarah Webster said she tweeted with a similar motive. Webster has tweeted about her assault in the past and says that nothing is too private for her to share on her account, which is focused on sex and body image. During the course of the Twitter conversation, the question of whether most assailants are strangers or not arose, and Webster decided it was important to share her story. Webster says she was raped by someone she was very close to and hoped her experience would show others that even those you trust can be perpetrators. ""I was sexually assaulted by someone I knew, and at the time I wasn't wearing anything at all. It was in my home by someone who was never supposed to do that to me,"" she says. ""I wanted to contribute another side of the story.""

Scott Berkowitz, the President and Founder of the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN) was not surprised that seeing so many people share the same experience on Twitter motivated people to share their stories for the first time. ""Having this whole community of other people who have been through something similar can be really empowering for people,"" he says. ""I think there's safety in numbers. We see that in a lot of scenarios with sexual assault survivors. When there's allegations, say, against a particular priest that becomes public, suddenly many other people who were abused by that person are okay with coming forward.""

Those who posted compared the spontaneous movement to Take Back the Night and Slut Walk—two organized campaigns that have aimed to create safe environments for rape victims to share their stories, debunk the notion of victim blaming and restore safety to campuses and neighborhoods. The popularity of such projects proves that large groups of victims speaking out can bolster other survivors' confidence. But unlike past movements, this one took place on social media, which can be simultaneously both anonymous and extremely public.

Anyone on the Internet can read your tweets; and anyone on Twitter can respond to them. You can choose how much information you share about your real identity in your Twitter profile. Some shared their experiences anonymously; others had names and faces attached to their profiles and hence, their stories. Either way many thousands of strangers read their tweets, a fact that became controversial when some media outlets reprinted the tweets and were accused of doing so without everyone's permission. An argument ensued as to whether tweets are public or private and whether extra consideration should be given to sensitive cases such as this one .

The anonymity, after all, is exactly what convinced some victims to share their stories. Many of those who posted who I interviewed said that though Twitter was public, their family didn't know that they tweeted and were unlikely to see the tweets. Sharing their story on Twitter with other survivors felt safer than sharing on someplace like Facebook where their tight circle, that might include family members who don't know about the assault or even the assailant him or herself, might be able to see.

RAINN has found that some anonymity helps those who have never shared before. ""We launched an online hotline in 2006 to compliment our telephone hotline because we were finding that younger victims in particular just weren’t comfortable picking up the phone and saying out loud what happened to them,"" says Berkowitz. ""But that sitting in the privacy of their room at their computer with at least a measure of anonymity there that they tend to open up much more.""

But that's an anonymous hotline. Twitter is a public forum, where there's always gong to be backlash. “In a [therapy] group, you generally sign a confidentiality agreement. There are no agreements on Twitter. Nobody cares about you. It’s the Internet,” says Nicole Aghaaliandastjerdi who shared her experience and now runs a women’s abuse support group in Louisville, KY. Along with all the supportive messages came the the kind of slut-shaming that originally spurred the conversation. “I remember someone was tweeting, ‘Look at all the damaged goods.’ That was really hard for even me to read, and I’m pretty far along in my healing process.”

Despite such comments, Aghaaliandastjerdi focuses on the good that came out of it, like her friend who had only shared once before but decided to participate on Twitter. “That was huge for her. For a lot of people, they’re taking back whatever had been taken from them. They’re claiming it and giving the story a different kind of power.”

Indeed, many first-time sharers found safety in numbers. Clifford Johnson, 31, hadn't shared his story before except with a few close family members. “When I think about it, it kind me feel like a little less than a man—just the fact that it happened.”

But seeing others share their story and the ease of tweeting allowed him to post. ""I don't think I intended to go that deep. I almost deleted it because I didn't know if I wanted this out there."" But as people began to respond he changed his mind. “It was a forum for the first time I was able to say what happened and get feedback from other people who went through the same thing. Plus, everyone there was a woman, you know? And it just kind of got me to thinking about things that happened to me as a child, and I wanted to put it out there to say, ‘It doesn’t matter what you’re wearing. It doesn’t even matter your race or sex. It could happen to anybody.’”

The experience made him want to become involved in advocacy for male victims of rape.

The Twitter conversation was a healing process for many of those who participated. The majority of responses were ones of love and support from strangers.

""What made me feel okay is that it’s so much more prevalent than one might initially think. Even though in my personal network that I follow I didn’t see anyone else respond, the fact that there were so many people responding to the question made me realize it’s not an uncommon thing,"" says Ayanna who wanted her last name to be withheld and tweeted despite the fact that her ex-boyfriend and assailant still follows her on social media. ""Some women tweeted at me who had been through the same thing. They really identified with what I said and it made me feel validated in my decision.""

Of the seven assault survivors I interviewed, none regretted having tweeted.

“I’m sure hundreds of people probably woke up today with a heavy burden lifted off them,"" Johnson says."

268,http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/refined-sugar-toxic-to-your-health/?a_aid=54e3fadc2316d,newsbbc,Refined Sugar: Sweet but Toxic to Your Health,[],"Most of us recognize that sugar does not promote good health. In fact, most people know that sugar is unhealthy, but not everyone understands the full extent of its unhealthiness. Refined sugar, such as high fructose corn syrup, is nothing but empty calories and it’s highly addictive; artificial sweeteners like aspartame are even worse. Sugar is added to many food products and it’s almost impossible to escape.

There was a time when bread consisted of flour, yeast, salt, and water. Now, sugar and a number of other, questionable ingredients can be found in most types of bread. For example, we looked at a few of the most popular brands of white bread on the market. For most, just two slices account for almost 20% of your daily sodium allowance, have more calories than beer, almost no fiber, and about 6 grams of sugar in the form of high fructose corn syrup.[1]

What Makes Refined Sugar Toxic to the Body

The dangers of sugar have been known for decades. William Dufty described the sugar problem in his book Sugar Blues , published in 1975.[1]

“Refined sugar has been depleted of its life forces, vitamins and minerals. What is left consists of pure, refined carbohydrates. The body cannot utilize this refined starch and carbohydrate unless the depleted proteins, vitamins and minerals are present. Nature supplies these elements in each plant in quantities sufficient to metabolize the carbohydrate in that particular plant. There is no excess for other added carbohydrates. Incomplete carbohydrate metabolism results in the formation of ‘toxic metabolite’ such as pyruvic acid and abnormal sugars containing five carbon atoms. Pyruvic acid accumulates in the brain and nervous system and the abnormal sugars in the red blood cells. These toxic metabolites interfere with the respiration of the cells. They cannot get sufficient oxygen to survive and function normally. In time, some of the cells die. This interferes with the function of a part of the body and is the beginning of degenerative disease.”

“Refined sugar is lethal when ingested by humans because it provides only that which nutritionists describe as ‘empty’ calories. It lacks the natural minerals which are present in sugar beet or cane.”

“In addition, sugar is worse than nothing because it drains and leaches the body of precious vitamins and minerals through the demand its digestion, detoxification, and elimination makes upon one’s entire system.”

William Dufty may have been ahead of his time; he understood that acidity leads to health problems.

“Sugar taken every day produces a continuously overacid (sic) condition, and more and more minerals are required from deep in the body in the attempt to rectify the imbalance. To protect the blood, so much calcium is taken from the bones and teeth that decay and general weakening begin. Excess sugar eventually affects every organ in the body.”

When Sugar Enters the Body

Initially, sugar is stored in the liver. When the liver can no longer handle the load, excess sugar, known as glycogen, is returned to the blood as fatty acids. Fatty acids are stored in organs such as the heart and kidneys. Here the tissues degenerate and turn to fat, affecting the whole body.

“The circulatory and lymphatic systems are invaded, and the quality of the red corpuscles starts to change. An overabundance of white cells occurs, and the creation of tissue becomes slower. Our body’s tolerance and immunizing power become limited. We cannot respond properly to extreme attacks, whether they be cold, heat, mosquitoes or microbes.”

“When refined sugar is taken daily, these bacteria wither and die, and our stock of B vitamins gets very low. Too much sugar makes one sleepy; our ability to calculate and remember is lost.”

There is also a strong correlation between sugar consumption and diabetes.[2] Sugar-filled foods and soft drinks have led to a diabetes epidemic. In the U.S., almost 30 million people have diabetes and 86 million adults over 20 have pre-diabetes. One in four diabetic Americans does not even know they have the disease.[3]

“In 1929, in Panama, for sugar plantation owners who ate large amounts of their refined stuff, diabetes was common. However, native cane-cutters, who only chewed the raw cane, saw no diabetes.”

The Sugar Industry’s Creative Marketing Tactics

The sugar takeover is no accident. Serious marketing efforts and even more serious dollars are at work. There are actually many similarities between big tobacco and the sugar producers. Both have invested billions of dollars developing creative ways to convince consumers that their deadly products are actually healthy.

“Beginning with World War I, the sugar pushers coated their propaganda with a preparedness pitch. Dietitians have known the high food value of sugar for a long time, said an industry tract of the 1920s. But it took World War I to bring this home. The energy-building power of sugar reaches the muscles in minutes and it was of value to soldiers as a ration given them just before an attack was launched.”

“Later, the sugar pushers advertised that sugar was chemically pure, being 99.9 percent pure. ‘No food of our everyday diet is purer,’ we were assured. What was meant by purity, besides the unarguable fact that all vitamins, minerals, salts, fibers, and proteins had been removed in the refining process? Well, the sugar pushers came up with a new slant on purity. ‘You don’t have to sort it like beans, wash it like rice. Every grain is like every other. No waste attends its use. No useless bones like in meat, no grounds like coffee. ‘Pure’ is a favorite adjective of the sugar pushers because it means one thing to the chemists and another thing to the ordinary mortals.”

The Carbohydrate Deception

Rebranding sugar as “carbohydrates” was another clever way to influence consumers. While technically true, the phrasing creates an impression that sugars are like other carbohydrates, such as cereal grains. Today, sugar is still listed under “Total Carbohydrates” on the Nutrition Facts label of food products.

“The use of the word “carbohydrate” to describe sugar is deliberately misleading. Since the improved labeling of nutritional properties was required, refined carbohydrates like sugar are lumped together with those carbohydrates which may not be refined. The several types of carbohydrates are added together for an overall carbohydrate total. Thus, the effect of the label is to hide the sugar content from the unwary buyer.”

Refined sugar manufacturers often twist the word ‘natural’ to mislead the public. Saying that something is made from “natural ingredients” creates the perception of a healthy, plant-based product. In reality, “natural” has become a marketing buzzword. Consider this example: apple and maple oatmeal. It sounds like a nutritious, vegetarian breakfast made from healthy, natural ingredients. However, a popular fast food chain has this item on the menu and it contains 31 grams of sugar — not too healthy.

Sugar: Toxic to Digestion

Much like pouring sugar into the gas tank of a car will gum up the engine, sugar has a negative effect on digestion and nutrient absorption.

“When starches and complex sugars (like those in honey and fruits) are digested, they break down into simple sugars called “monosaccharides”, which are usable substances-nutrients. When starches and sugars are taken together and undergo fermentation, they are broken down into carbon dioxide, acetic acid, alcohol, and water. With the exception of the water, all these are unusable substances—poisons. When proteins are digested, they are broken down into amino acids, which are usable substances-nutrients. When proteins are taken with sugar, they putrefy; they are broken down into a variety of ptomaines and leucomaines, which are nonusable substances-poisons. Enzymic digestion of foods prepares them for use by our body. Bacterial decomposition makes them unfit for use by our body. The first process gives us nutrients; the second gives us poisons.”

The bottom line? Refined sugar is one of the most toxic, least beneficial substances you can put into your body. If sugar, or its artificial substitutes, have a hold on your life, it’s time for a change. Sugar causes inflammation, which leads to all sorts of health problems, sugar is bad for your teeth, sugar slows digestion, sugar even has an effect on your brain. Stop drinking the nutrient-deficient soft drinks and start drinking life-supporting water. Stop consuming pre-packaged snacks loaded with refined sugar or dangerous artificial sweeteners and start consuming foods that don’t have a label. And, if you’re tired, weary, and need a boost, start cleansing your body!

Working with younger children in an early childhood education setting, you may only need an associate degree, but sometimes these positions do require a Bachelor’s degree. If you prefer to teach in a school, you will need to enroll in a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree program to meet your goals. In addition to a college degree, teachers also need certification or licensure from the state in which they wish to teach, which can sometimes be obtained while working on the degree or can be gotten after the degree coursework is complete. Another degree option is obtaining a Ph.D. to teach college or university level courses.

For a Bachelor’s degree online, you can expect to spend about 2 to 3 years on your studies and about 1 1/2 to 2 years for a Master’s program. Many programs also include the certification process as a part of their curriculum. If you want to teach elementary school, your studies will likely include a range of all subjects you will be teaching such as math, English, social studies, and science, as well as teaching theories, classroom management, and child development. Middle school and high school teachers will probably focus more intently on their subject of choice during their education rather than the wider range seen with elementary school teachers.

Teaching early childhood, elementary, middle school, and high school are not the only options for those interested in education. Special education, school administration, and reading specialists are among the other careers available for those working in the education and teaching fields. The field of education is a stable one with schools continuing to expand as the population continues to grow. Median salaries for regular education teachers is between $43,580 to $48,690 while special education teachers earn an average closer to $46,360."

By Arun Goel With the ever-increasing incidence of lifestyle diseases like cardio-vascular and nervous system disorders, the time has come for us to address this ourselves, fair and square WITHOUT external dependence. Did you know that reprogramming your natural breathing technique would not only help in preventing these problems but also help in the “reversal” of several such harmful conditions? Yes, it’s not only possible but proven too. In fact leading cardiac experts are advocating the benefits of “correct” breathing to their patients. Surprising as it is, almost none of us use the full capacity of our respiratory organs. This is aggravated by our sedentary lifestyles and leads to several complications popularly called - lifestyle disorders. The first question that comes to mind is – “How can I alter my natural breathing process?” Well, astonishing as it may seem, it’s true. By training our body to breathe in a particular fashion, we re-program our involuntary system to adopt this new way of breathing. This breathing technique is called the “Full Yogic breath” or simply Yoga breathing. Without wasting time, I’ll plunge right away into the technique followed by its overwhelming benefits. First, lie down on your back, relaxed, with hands and legs outstretched and eyes looking up at the roof. Gently close your eyes and relax. Step 1: Abdominal breathing Observe your natural breath. You will notice that as you inhale the abdomen rises and then falls with exhalation. Watch this for a few moments to check this flow. Now begin to deepen, lengthen and extend that movement. That is, while inhaling, let the abdomen rise to its limit and at exhalation let it fall completely. Keep the chest still during this entire process – only move the abdomen. Continue this for 20 breaths and then rest. Step 2: Thoracic (chest) breathing Again observe your normal breath, this time focusing your attention on the chest. You will notice the chest moving slightly up at inhalation and down with exhalation. Again observe this pattern for a few moments. Now again, begin to deepen, lengthen and extend that movement. This time, on inhalation expand and lift the rib cage, filling the lungs completely. Then on exhalation, let the lungs collapse fully, sinking to the limits. In this step, keep the abdomen still, moving only the chest. Do this for 20 breath cycles and then stop Step 3: Full Yogic breathing This combines the above 2 steps in the following way:

First inhale by filling the abdomen and then CONTINUE inhaling as you expand and fill the chest. Then exhale first from the chest as it empties and falls and then CONTINUE exhaling from the abdomen as it draws inwards completely. This is one round of the full yogic breath. Repeat this for 20 rounds. Remember the pattern… Inhaling - abdomen then chest; Exhaling – chest then abdomen. GOLDEN RULE: All of the above steps should be done WITHOUT strain. The natural tendency is to heave with effort. The right way is to make it smooth and effortless. Go slow and easy. Initially you will experience unevenness or bumps in this breathing process – as if there are 4 separate parts to the full yogic breath. This is natural considering the years we have spent breathing improperly. Instead, try to picture this breath as a continuous wave like pattern – as if the breath moves up from the navel to the throat with every inhalation and then, down from the throat to the navel with each exhalation. It may take a few weeks of practice to perfect a “SMOOTH flowing pattern with MINIMUM effort and with MAXIMUM capacity.”



This is the desired effect!! Over time, the yoga way of breathing will come naturally to you. And now for the all-important benefits… The full yogic breath is the basic building block of the powerful yoga breathing techniques, also called ‘Pranayama’ in Sanskrit, which are known for their multifarious benefits.



But the tangible benefits of the full yogic breath are that it: Releases acute and chronic muscular tensions around the heart and digestive organs.

Helps sufferers of respiratory illnesses such as asthma and emphysema to overcome the fear of shortness of breath. It actually increases lung capacity.

Encourages proper nervous stimulus to the cardio-vascular system

Dramatically reduces emotional and nervous anxiety

Improves detoxification through increased exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen

Amplifies the auto immune system by increased distribution of energy to the endocrine system

Calms the mind and integrates the mental / physical balance. And the real icing is that it contributes to both vitality and relaxation through this single practice. With such powerful all-round benefits, do you really need to be “motivated” to get going? Go ahead, and take charge of your life like never before. All the best,

The individual most likely used a USB drive to copy the information. The groundbreaking new analysis irrevocably destroys the Russian hacking narrative, and calls the actions of Crowdstrike and the DNC into question.

The document supplied to Disobedient Media via Adam Carter was authored by an individual known as The Forensicator. The full document referenced here has been published on their blog. Their analysis indicates the data was almost certainly not accessed initially by a remote hacker, much less one in Russia. If true, this analysis obliterates the Russian hacking narrative completely.

The Forensicator specifically discusses the data that was eventually published by Guccifer 2.0 under the title “NGP-VAN.” This should not be confused with the separate publication of the DNC emails by Wikileaks. This article focuses solely on evidence stemming from the files published by Guccifer 2.0, which were previously discussed in depth by Adam Carter.

Disobedient Media previously reported that Crowdstrike is the only group that has directly analyzed the DNC servers. Other groups including Threat Connect have used the information provided by Crowdstrike to claim that Russians hacked the DNC. However, their evaluation was based solely on information ultimately provided by Crowdstrike; this places the company in the unique position of being the only direct source of evidence that a hack occurred.

The group’s President Shawn Henry is a retired executive assistant director of the FBI while their co-founder and CTO, Dmitri Alperovitch, is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, which as we have reported, is linked to George Soros. Carter has stated on his website that “At present, it looks a LOT like Shawn Henry & Dmitri Alperovitch (CrowdStrike executives), working for either the HRC campaign or DNC leadership were very likely to have been behind the Guccifer 2.0 operation.” Carter’s website was described by Wikileaks as a useful source of primary information specifically regarding Guccifer 2.0.

Carter recently spoke to Disobedient Media, explaining that he had been contacted by The Forensicator, who had published a document which contained a detailed analysis of the data published by Guccifer 2.0 as “NGP-VAN.”

The document states that the files that eventually published as “NGP-VAN” by Guccifer 2.0 were first copied to a system located in the Eastern Time Zone, with this conclusion supported by the observation that “the .7z file times, after adjustment to East Coast time fall into the range of the file times in the .rar files.” This constitutes the first of a number of points of analysis which suggests that the information eventually published by the Guccifer 2.0 persona was not obtained by a Russian hacker.

The Forensicator stated in their analysis that a USB drive was most likely used to boot Linux OS onto a computer that either contained the alleged DNC files or had direct access to them. They also explained to us that in this situation one would simply plug a USB drive with the LinuxOS into a computer and reboot it; after restarting, the computer would boot from the USB drive and load Linux instead of its normal OS. A large amount of data would then be copied to this same USB drive.

In this case, additional files would have been copied en masse, to be “pruned” heavily at a later time when the 7zip archive now known as NGP-VAN was built. The Forensicator wrote that if 1.98 GB of data had been copied at a rate of 22.6 MB/s and time gaps t were noticed at the top level of the NGP-VAN 7zip file were attributed to additional file copying, then approximately 19.3 GB in total would have been copied. In this scenario, the 7zip archive (NGP-VAN) would represent only about 10% of the total amount of data that was collected.

The very small proportion of files eventually selected for use in the creation of the “NGP-VAN” files were later published by the creators of the Guccifer 2.0 persona. This point is especially significant, as it suggests the possibility that up to 90% of the information initially copied was never published.

The use of a USB drive would suggest that the person first accessing the data could not have been a Russian hacker. In this case, the person who copied the files must have physically interacted with a computer that had access to what Guccifer 2.0 called the DNC files. A less likely explanation for this data pattern where large time gaps were observed between top level files and directories

in the 7zip file, can be explained by the use of ‘think time’ to select and copy 1.9 GB of individual files, copied in small batches with think time interspersed. In either scenario, Linux would have been booted from a USB drive, which fundamentally necessitates physical access to a computer with the alleged DNC files.

The Forensicator believed that using the possible ‘think-time’ explanation to explain the time-gaps was a less likely explanation for the data pattern available, with a large amount of data most likely copied instantaneously, later “pruned” in the production of the Guccifer 2.0’s publication of the NGP-VAN files.

Both the most likely explanation and the less likely scenario provided by The Forensicator’s analysis virtually exclude the possibility of a Russian or remote hacker gaining external access to the files later published as “NGP-VAN.” In both cases, the physical presence of a person accessing a containing DNC information would be required.

Importantly, The Forensicator concluded that the chance that the files had been accessed and downloaded remotely over the internet were too small to give this idea any serious consideration. He explained that the calculated transfer speeds for the initial copy were much faster than can be supported by an internet connection. This is extremely significant and completely discredits allegations of Russian hacking made by both Guccifer 2.0 and Crowdstrike. This conclusion is further supported by analysis of the overall transfer rate of 23 MB/s. The Forensicator described this as “possible when copying over a LAN, but too fast to support the hypothetical scenario that the alleged DNC data was initially copied over the Internet (esp. to Romania).” Guccifer 2.0 had claimed to originate in Romania. So in other words, this rate indicates that the data was downloaded locally, possibly using the local DNC network. The importance of this finding in regards to destroying the Russian hacking narrative cannot be overstated. If the data is correct, then the files could not have been copied over a remote connection and so therefore cannot have been “hacked by Russia.” The use of a USB drive would also strongly suggest that the person copying the files had physical access to a computer most likely connected to the local DNC network. Indications that the individual used a USB drive to access the information over an internal connection, with time stamps placing the creation of the copies in the East Coast Time Zone, suggest that the individual responsible for initially copying what was eventually published by the Guccifer 2.0 persona under the title “NGP-VAN” was located in the Eastern United States, not Russia.

The implications of The Forensicator‘s analysis in combination with Adam Carter‘s work, suggest that at the very least, the Russian hacking narrative is patently false. Adam Carter has a strong grasp on the NGP-VAN files and Guccifer 2.0, with his website on the subject called a “good source” by Wikileaks via twitter. Carter told Disobedient Media that in his opinion the analysis provided by The Forensicator was accurate, but added that if changes are made to the work in future, any new conclusions would require further vetting.

On the heels of recent retractions by legacy media outlets like CNN and The New York Times, this could have serious consequences, if months of investigation into the matter by authorities are proven to have been based on gross misinformation based solely on the false word of Crowdstrike.

Assange recently lamented widespread ignorance about the DNC Leak via Twitter, specifically naming Hillary Clinton, the DNC, the Whitehouse and mainstream media as having “reason” to suppress the truth of the matter. As one of the only individuals who would have been aware of the source of the DNC Leaks, Assange’s statement corroborates a scenario where the DNC and parties described in Adam Carter’s work likely to have included Crowdstrike, may have participated in “suppressing knowledge” of the true origins and evidence surrounding the leak of the DNC emails by confusing them with the publication of the Guccifer 2.0 persona.

Despite Guccifer 2.0’s conflicting reports of having both been a Russian hacker and having contact with Seth Rich, the work of The Forensicator indicates that neither of these scenarios is likely true. What is suggested is that the files now known as “NGP-VAN” were copied by someone with access to a system connected to the DNC internal network, and that this action had no bearing on the files submitted to Wikileaks and were most likely unassociated with Seth Rich, and definitively not remotely “hacked” from Russia.

Kanye West has postponed upcoming concerts in Philadelphia and Detroit.

In the wake of wife Kim Kardashian West's robbery Sunday night in Paris, the Famous rapper has rescheduled Tuesday's Philadelphia show at Wells Fargo Center for Dec. 13, a Live Nation representative confirmed to USA TODAY. Thursday's Detroit concert at the Palace of Auburn Hills will now be held Dec. 22.

Ticketholders can use their original tickets on those dates.

West abruptly cut short his Sunday headlining set at The Meadows Music & Arts Festival in Queens, N.Y., when he was advised onstage of a ""family emergency."" Kardashian, who was in France for Paris Fashion Week, was robbed at gunpoint in a private residence by masked men, who made off with more than $10 million worth of jewelry. The reality TV mogul has since returned to New York.

The Saint Pablo tour will resume Friday in Chicago. The North American trek, which West launched this summer in support of album The Life of Pablo, will hit major cities across the Midwest and West Coast throughout October and November.

274,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-southchinasea-idUSKBN1572M4,newsbbc,China says will protect South China Sea sovereignty,"['Ben Blanchard', 'David Brunnstrom']","BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China said on Tuesday it had ""irrefutable"" sovereignty over disputed islands in the South China Sea after the White House vowed to defend ""international territories"" in the strategic waterway.

White House spokesman Sean Spicer in his comments on Monday signaled a sharp departure from years of cautious U.S. handling of China's assertive pursuit of territorial claims in Asia.

""The U.S. is going to make sure that we protect our interests there,"" Spicer said when asked if Trump agreed with comments by his secretary of state nominee, Rex Tillerson. On Jan. 11, Tillerson said China should not be allowed access to islands it has built in the contested South China Sea.

""It's a question of if those islands are in fact in international waters and not part of China proper, then yeah, we're going to make sure that we defend international territories from being taken over by one country,"" Spicer said.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular news briefing on Tuesday ""the United States is not a party to the South China Sea dispute"".

China claims most of the South China Sea, while Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Brunei claims parts of the sea that commands strategic sealanes and has rich fishing grounds along with oil and gas deposits.

China's sovereignty over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea was ""irrefutable"" Hua said. But China was also dedicated to protecting freedom of navigation and wants talks with nations directly involved to find a peaceful solution.

""We urge the United States to respect the facts, speak and act cautiously to avoid harming the peace and stability of the South China Sea,"" Hua said.

""Our actions in the South China Sea are reasonable and fair. No matter what changes happen in other countries, what they say or what they want to do, China's resolve to protect its sovereignty and maritime rights in the South China Sea will not change,"" she added.

Bar Access to Islands

Tillerson's remarks at his Senate confirmation hearing prompted Chinese state media to say at the time that the United States would need to ""wage war"" to bar China's access to the islands, where it has built military-length air strips and installed weapons systems.

Tillerson was asked at the hearing whether he supported a more aggressive posture toward China and said: ""We're going to have to send China a clear signal that, first, the island-building stops and, second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed.""

The former Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) chairman and chief executive did not elaborate on what might be done to deny China access to the islands.

But analysts said his comments, like those of Spicer, suggested the possibility of U.S. military action, or even a naval blockade. Such action would risk an armed confrontation with China, an increasingly formidable nuclear-armed military power. It is also the world's second-largest economy and the target of Trump accusations it is stealing American jobs.

Spicer declined to elaborate when asked how the United States could enforce such a move against China, except to say: ""I think, as we develop further, we'll have more information on it.""

Tillerson narrowly won approval from a Senate committee on Monday and is expected to win confirmation from the full Senate.

Risk of Dangerous Escalation

Military experts said that while the U.S. Navy has extensive capabilities in Asia to stage blockading operations with ships, submarines and planes, any such move against China's growing naval fleets would risk a dangerous escalation.

U.S. President Donald Trump signs an executive order on U.S. withdrawal from the Trans Pacific Partnership while flanked by Vice President Mike Pence (L) and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus (R) in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington January 23, 2017. Kevin Lamarque

Aides have said that Trump plans a major naval build-up in East Asia to counter China's rise.

China's foreign ministry said earlier this month it could not guess what Tillerson meant by his remarks, which came after Trump questioned Washington's longstanding and highly sensitive ""one-China"" policy over Taiwan.

Washington-based South China Sea expert Mira Rapp-Hooper at the Center for a New American Security called the threats to bar China's access in the South China Sea ""incredible"" and said it had no basis in international law.

""A blockade - which is what would be required to actually bar access - is an act of war,"" she added.

""The Trump administration has begun to draw red lines in Asia that they will almost certainly not be able to uphold, but they may nonetheless be very destabilizing to the relationship with China, invite crises, and convince the rest of the world that the United States is an unreliable partner.""

Bonnie Glaser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank called Spicer's remarks ""worrisome"" and said the new administration was ""sending confusing and conflicting messages.""

Dean Cheng, a China expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Spicer's remarks showed the South China Sea was an important issue for the Trump administration.

He said it was significant that neither Spicer nor Tillerson had been specific as to what actions would be taken and this left open the possibility that economic measures - instead of military steps - could be used against China and firms that carry out island building.

To ease the family’s financial burden, a GoFundMe campaign was set up. Incredibly, $325,000 was raised in just one week!

Casualties in war are inevitable. However, coping with the absence of an individual after they’ve passed never gets easier. Fortunately for the family of Special Forces Sergeant Mark De Alencar, kind people from all around the globe have reached out to honor the military member who was killed while fighting ISIS and in doing so, have greatly alleviated the financial burden the family faces.

GoodNewsNetwork reports that last weekend, Alencar was killed while fighting in Afghanistan. During his time as a Green Beret, he was recognized with over 19 awards and badges, including the Purple Heart, the Iraq Campaign Medal with two stars, Expert Infantryman Badge, and others. He leaves behind a wife and five children.

To honor the fallen soldier, a close friend named Nikki Damron created a GoFundMe campaign to ease the grieving family’s financial burdens. The initial goal was set at $15,000, but incredibly, it raised over $200,000 in one night. One week later, it surpassed $325,000.

On the campaign page, Nikki wrote:

“Mark was a close friend of my husbands and my family, a hard working soldier and more importantly, an amazing father. Our community has been hit hard in the last passing months and I just felt the need to try and do my part and help out his family. “Joining SF was a huge dream of Marks, one he worked very hard to achieve. As a fellow military wife, I feel it is my duty to make every effort to ensure his wife and family are taken care of,” she added.

War easily paints the world as a terrifying, grim place to live. Fortunately, stories are frequently offered to remind one that plenty of positive happenings occur on this planet, as well. Please share this news and comment your thoughts below!

McCain said on Wednesday Russia’s alleged cyberattacks against US political organizations to influence the 2016 presidential election amount to an “act of war.”

""It's an act of war,"" McCain, a staunch opponent of Russia, told reporters on the US Capitol in Washington, DC.

""If you try to destroy the fundamentals of democracy, then you have destroyed a nation,” said McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

""I'm not saying it's an atomic attack. I'm just saying that when you attack a nation's fundamental structure, which they are doing, then it's an act of war,” he continued.

McCain also accused Moscow of committing an ""act of war"" against the United States last week, and demanded stronger sanctions against Russia over the hacking, which the US intelligence community claims amounted to meddling in the US election.

McCain has been a virulent critic of Russia and President-elect Donald Trump, who has repeatedly cast doubt over the claim that Russia launched cyberattacks on the US.

On Thursday, the Senate Armed Services Committee, led by McCain, is to hold the first public hearing in Congress on the alleged hacking.

McCain and other top congressional leaders have pledged to press legislation on sanctions against Russia in addition to those announced by President Barack Obama last month.

On December 22, Obama announced a series of economic sanctions against Russia, as well as expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats, over allegations that it interfered in the 2016 presidential election through cyberattacks.

McCain has criticized the sanctions as insufficient and overdue.

However, Trump, the incoming US president, has repeatedly questioned the accuracy of US intelligence pointing to Russia’s responsibility for the hacks and has said it was time to ""move on.""

The US claim has been rejected by Moscow. Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, which published the stolen emails, has also denied that the Russian government provided the files."

The undercover station was in 7 World Trade Center, a smaller office tower that fell several hours after the collapse of the twin towers on Sept. 11, a U.S. government official said.

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that immediately after the attack, a special CIA team scoured the rubble in search of secret documents and intelligence reports stored in the station, either on paper or in computers. It was not known whether the efforts were successful.

A CIA spokesman declined to comment on the existence of the office, which was first reported in Sunday's editions of The New York Times.

The New York station was behind the false front of another federal organization, which the Times did not identify. The station was a base of operations to spy on and recruit foreign diplomats stationed at the United Nations, while debriefing selected American business executives and others willing to talk to the CIA after returning from overseas.

The agency's officers in New York often work undercover, posing as diplomats and business executives, among other things. They have been deeply involved in counter-terrorism efforts in the New York area, working jointly with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies.

The CIA's main New York office was unaffected by the attacks, but agents have been sharing space at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, and have borrowed other federal government offices in the city.

The agency is prohibited from conducting domestic espionage operations against Americans, but it maintains stations in a number of major United States cities, where CIA case officers try to meet and recruit students and other foreigners to return to their countries and spy for the United States.

The New York station was believed to have been the largest and most important CIA domestic station outside the Washington area.

According to the most recent Federal Election Commission filing, Jill Stein still has $1,361,834.20 in the bank.

President Trump was critical of the Green Party recount effort. He mentioned this on several occasions while the recount was going on. He later Tweeted referring to the recount as a “Stein scam to raise money.”

It appears President Trump may have been right all along. The efforts to “scam” Democrats don’t seem to end there. Just yesterday Jill Stein sent a cryptic tweet.

She appears to be trying to gain support from former Bernie supporters, and from Trump supporters when she said:

“Bad Ideas survive in our society by going unchallenged”- Dr. Mike Adams

On Monday evening, March 6th Mike Adams, Ph.D. Professor of Criminology at UNC-W spoke to about 100 people at the UNC Student Union about Free Speech. Speaking about his experiences and his victories, Dr. Adams received enthusiasm.

Sam Cullier, an Economics student at UNC, wanted other students to know that there are plenty of students who feel as he does about Freedom of Speech, and he was anticipating a good speech from Dr. Adams, who he feels is a “Fantastic guy.” “I have seen many of his Social Media Posts on the topics of Political Correctness,” Sam told me. “I think that Political Correctness is like a Cancer on Campus,” he went on. “I think other students are willing to sacrifice the truth to preserve a Political Ideology,” he told me. And that bothers him.

Currently, Sam doesn’t do much on the topic of Free Speech, other than post on Social Media about it to his friends.

Dr. Adams encouraged the attendees to start Freedom of Speech Clubs wherever they could, giving them examples of how to make a lasting impact on the movement.

FREE SPEECH IS SEXY!

Readers may recognize the name. Professor Adams made this topic of Campus Reform hot before anyone else in the movement knew what Sexy was! Mike has given 94 speeches on the Topic of Freedom of Speech over the years. He may be an originator of Guerilla Theater for College Republicans.

Back in 2005 Professor Adams had made a name for himself as written about in this article with the Canadian Free Press

A FOUNDING FATHER IN THE MOVEMENT!

Mike Adams may be the Orginal Milo, in fact, having been escorted off two college Campuses, after offending “snowflakes,” himself. Dr. Adams told me that he isn’t afraid of facing violent opposition to his speeches because he demands that the Police do their job and protect his speech. He is very confident and unafraid.

In attendance were 7-8 local police to keep the order, if needed. Mike is no stranger to offending people, AND he speaks out loudly to encourage others to challenge Campus “Speech Codes.”

Dr. Adams has been actively involved in a few high-profile, Campus Free Speech cases. In fact, appearing on Fox News numerous times on the topic. He once was in a debate with a Porn Star, on MSNBC.

You may remember planking where a person would try to look like a board on top of some object. This challenge requires more than a single person with strong abs.

It reminds me of an extreme version of the “quiet game”. This High School just raised the bar on this challenge. I have to admit, this will be a fun challenge to watch over the next few weeks! This might just get interesting.

A High School in North Richland Hills, Texas, took the Mannequin Challenge to a whole new level today. It seems they had a Pep-Rally. The entire gymnasium full of students participated in the Mannequin Challenge. The Official Richland High School YouTube Account shared a video.

No, this video below is not computer generated graphics. This is an entire High School, over 1000 young adults standing still and silent. That is about as extreme as it gets.

About the only thing that could beat this is Jerry Jones getting his fans to participate in this challenge at a Cowboys Game! —Where you at Jerry Jones – Dallas Cowboys?!?

If you have any doubts about how EXTREME this really is, just ask any High School teacher how difficult it is to get a room full of High School students to be quite. This is just about a Extreme as it gets…

As you watch the video look at how many people near the President are armed.

That young Lance Corporal, who lost his cover, is armed with a Baretta M9 9mm pistol. When you look at his chest he has two marksmanship medals. The one on the left shows his rifle proficiency the smaller one on the right his pistol skills.

He is an Expert Rifleman and an Expert with a Pistol. Achieving “Expert” status with a pistol in very difficult.

You will also notice the Presidential Seal on the Marine’s right pocket. This Marine has earned his place amoung the Presidential Guard. He has a Military Occupational Specialty of 8152.

Marines who have earned the 8152 designations are called “Gun-Slingers” by the rest of the Marine Corp. They are the very elite in small arms. What does that mean? Gunslingers have extensive training in small arms and they are VERY, VERY FAST and DEADLY ACCURATE!

Sure, most Marines can shoot and do it very well, but this Marine can pull his pistol from the holster and hit a target 30 feet away, three times, in less than half a second. Why does that matter?

At least he isn’t the kind of person who would go off and do something outrageous. His response to the news that ABC was cutting his show was much more subtle, but none the less a powerful message.

ABC News announced they were cutting Tim Allen’s show “The Last Man Standing.” The announcement to cancel the third most watched comedy show in the history of ABC was a shock to loyal viewers. Frustration and surprise followed the announcement.

Tim Allen didn’t make much of a fuss about it. He just moved on. Although he did use his Twitter account to express his sadness over the show being canceled.

Stunned and blindsided by the network I called home for the last six years. #lastmanstanding — Tim Allen (@ofctimallen) May 16, 2017

Today rumors began to swirl that “Last Man Standing” may continue after all. Sources inside Fox suggest the show will move to Fox and its affiliates along with “certain streaming services.” The show is actually owned by 20th Century Fox, a subsidiary of Fox Entertainment Group a.k.a Fox, not ABC.

ABC has canceled the show, but since it is owned by Fox, Fox can just move it. We are told that negotiations are under way with Fox and their affiliates to find a time for the show on their network. The Official Announcement to come within the next month.

Update Added: 5/23/2017

According to Deadline, the Parent TV Council has now Officially recommended that Fox replaces “The Mick” with “Last Man Standing,” saying:

“it’s a much safer show for families than The Mick and, for that matter, much safer than most programs on air on primetime broadcast television.”

ABC has angered Conservatives by canceling the show. Tim Allen was the clear victim of an attack on Conservatives which will further hurt ABCs bottom line. It looks like the Last Man Standing will be Tim Allen, at a new time and place with Fox.

After you share this, check out this message that Trump has for supporters, you won’t hear about this from the Mainstream Media! ==> ABC and WaPo buried the truth, but Trump dug it up for all to see!"

Of course “their sources” tell them it was “retroactively” classified. They provided no details of when or by whom the alleged “retroactive” action was taken. Finally, Politico was forced to admit:

At least one of Comey’s memos remains unclassified, the source with knowledge told POLITICO.

She collected over seven million dollars to pay for her “recounts.”

Once the dust settled and it was clear that Donald Trump was the winner Stein released a statement to the Press. In that statement, she said what remained after the recount would go to charity.

According to the most recent Federal Election Commission filing, Jill Stein still has $1,361,834.20 in the bank.

President Trump was critical of the Green Party recount effort. He mentioned this on several occasions while the recount was going on. He later Tweeted referring to the recount as a “Stein scam to raise money.”

The Green Party just dropped its recount suit in Pennsylvania and is losing votes in Wisconsin recount. Just a Stein scam to raise money! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016

It appears President Trump may have been right all along. The efforts to “scam” Democrats don’t seem to end there. Just yesterday Jill Stein sent a cryptic tweet.

She appears to be trying to gain support from former Bernie supporters, and from Trump supporters when she said:

“I didn’t sabotage Bernie” and ” ludicrous Russia conspiracy theories”

Unlike the Dems, I didn't sabotage Bernie Sanders in the primaries, then try to cover my tracks with ludicrous Russia conspiracy theories. — Dr. Jill Stein🌻 (@DrJillStein) July 21, 2017

It remains unclear what Jill Stein is up to. One thing is very clear. She promised to donate the funds left over from the recount to charity, but, seven months laters, she still has over $1,300,000.00 on hand.

Democrats and Republicans alike have good reason to question Dr. Jill Stein. We attempted to contact Stein and her campaign several times in the last two weeks but received no response.

Following her cryptic Tweet aimed at a broad audience, we determined it was important for all Americans that we publish this today.

She won’t answer our requests for information about the money, so, maybe she will respond to a few million Americans. You know what to do."

CNN’s Jim Acosta continues to attack President Trump every chance he gets. Most of the time it results in Fake News. Today was no different!

Earlier this morning Jim Acosta sent out a Tweet, directed at President Trump. In that Tweet, he accused the President of “finally” holding a press conference overseas. He ignored the fact that this only President Trump’s second trip abroad. Then he starts his typical whining about being called “fake news.”

Trump finally held a news conference overseas. But he took a question from a friendly reporter and then attacked CNN as ""fake news."" — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) July 6, 2017

Everyone knows about Jim Acosta’s showboating and his attacks on the President. Do you remember the time he was rude and interrupted Donald Trump? Who can forget, right!?! Donald Trump made it clear back then that he thinks CNN is “fake news.”

The attacks from this CNN Reporter haven’t stopped. After Jim Acosta’s inflammatory Tweet this morning, he took it a step further. He implied that President Trump was holding a “fake news conference” because CNN was not given an opportunity to ask a question.

Isn't it a ""fake news conference"" to take a question from a reporter who is essentially an ally of the White House? https://t.co/vD7DgAZXIv — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) July 6, 2017

It only took a few minutes for the Internet to catch on fire. Conservatives and Liberals both fired back at Jim Acosta. The most notable response was from Donald Trump Jr. He pointed out a very important fact.

If Jim Acosta thinks it is “fake news” when the President won’t take questions from CNN, does that mean every press conference held by Obama was “fake?”

I believe that when it comes to women and work, there isn’t one right answer. The only person who can create a life you’ll love is you.- IVANKA TRUMP

By almost any definition Ivanka Trump is a successful woman. She is an author and businesswoman. The 35-year-old graduate of the University of Pennsylvania is married to Jared Kushner, a real estate executive who owns the New York Observer, who serves as a White House senior advisor in the new administration.

Aside from her husband’s wealth, Ivanka has an estimated personal net worth of $150,000,000! Yet she is one of the liberal media’s favorite targets.

The daughter of the president, graduated from the Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania, cum laude, meaning “with honor”, which typically means she finished within the top 25 to 30 percent of her class, with a bachelor’s degree in economics in 2004.

Ivanka appeared on the cover of Seventeen magazine in 1997, has walked the fashion runways for Versace, and is bilingual, speaking English and French fluently, yet she is often criticized in the media when given the slightest opportunity.

Whether working as a television personality or fashion model, Ivanka has always lived her adult life in the public eye. During the presidential campaign, she campaigned and gave speeches and interviews. She did this while raising three children

Political opponents often use criticism of Ivanka’s clothing brand, as a way to make a statement as to how they feel about her dad. As of February 2017, department store chains Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom dropped Trump’s fashion line, citing “poor performance.”

Yet, in reality, the clothing line is reporting it achieved record sales numbers in the month of February.

“Since the beginning of February, they were some of the best performing weeks in the history of the brand,” Abigail Klem, the president of the Ivanka Trump fashion brand reported on Wednesday, according to The Hill.

She is very proud of her father, President Donald Trump.

I am so proud of my daughter Ivanka. To be abused and treated so badly by the media, and to still hold her head so high, is truly wonderful! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 11, 2017

“One of my father’s greatest talents is the ability to see the potential in people”, and she said, “he will make America great again.”

“Women Who Work” will be the second book by Ivanka Trump and has a release date of May 2, 2017.

I am certain President Trump is proud of his daughter’s accomplishments. We all should hope to do so well."

Major media outlets are losing viewers to more contemporary sources like Breitbart or WND. Other sites like ours have thrived in this new world where a small paper can grow by simply telling the truth. It would seem the days of “broadcast” messaging by the establishment are numbered.

Obama is aware of the trend and is now calling it the “wild, wild west.” He claims that wild conspiracy theories run rampant on the Internet. What he really means is, he and others like him cannot control a truly FREE PRESS! That is what we are. We are FREE from the influences of political powers. We are FREE to publish what we choose. We are FREE to expose facts without fear of losing our empire.

In a speech given at the University of Pittsburg Obama says”:

“We are going to have to rebuild within this wild-wild-west-of-information flow some sort of curating function that people agree to .. …There has to be, I think, some sort of way in which we can sort through information that passes some basic truthiness tests and those that we have to discard because they just don’t have any basis in anything that’s actually happening in the world,”

Censorship

Notice the subtle word; he wants to “curate,” in other words; he wants to censor free speech. He even goes on to say that it is not censorship. He wants a place where people can go to see if something is reliable as if people cannot think for themselves.

In other words, he wants to control the PRESS. Over the past four decades, we have seen Civil rights taken by the courts. The one thing the courts has never touched in the Freedom of the Press.

This might be because the Establishment controlled the press. BUT, not anymore! If there is one thing mightier than an AR-15, it’s my KEYBOARD and my relationship with many FREE PRESS publishers who won’t “CURATE” the news!"

A talented comedian and outspoken Republican, his Comedy show “Last Man Standing” has crushed ratings for six straight years. To the shock and surprise of loyal fans, his show was canceled a few days ago.

Supporters of his show and his politics quickly came to the show’s defense. A Change.Org petition was started asking ABC to keep the show. Shortly after, sources told Nation One News that Fox was negotiating to find a spot for the show. Two days later the show’s leadership broke their silence in an exclusive with Variety confirming that they were indeed looking for a new home.

Fortunately, for fans, the show is owned by 20th Century Fox, a subsidiary of Fox. This means the show can be moved to another network or streaming service.

In the face of growing outrage from Conservative ABC viewers, ABC tried to defend the decision saying it wasn’t about politics. According to the Washington Post, Channing Dungey, the Entertainment Group President said:

“There’s a lot of news, and I think that people are definitely looking to television as a place they want to feel, they want to laugh, they want to cry … the mood of the country has told us that television is a little bit of an escape… …What people want to do now is connect and experience and to feel … that did frame a lot of our development thinking this season.”

So, that is the end of story right? No, Not so fast!

The Mainstream Media did not report what Channing Dungey’s said a few months ago. In December 2016, before the inauguration, Channing Dungey reportedly said she was rethinking programming after the Trump victory.

This was less than six months ago. We reached out to ABC for a comment, so far we have received no response from ABC.

At the conference she said:

“…the channel has not paid enough attention to some of the true realities of what life is like for everyday Americans”

She seemed to imply that Trump would not have won if ABC had better control of what “everyday” Americans think.

After what was said in December do you think the decision to cancel Last Man Standing was political? Tell us what you think, and then help us SHARE the truth."

Half an hour into her show, she dropped the bombshell.

Maddow produced two pages from Donald Trump’s 2005 tax returns . . . thereby proving to the world that then businessman Donald Trump — wait for it — paid his taxes!!!

In fact, he paid a fortune in taxes — $38 million on $150 million of income.

Thank you Rachel Maddow for proving to your #Trump hating followers how successful @realDonaldTrump is & that he paid $40mm in taxes! #Taxes — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 15, 2017

Doing the math, Donald Trump paid about 25% of his earned income in taxes.

Trump paid more in taxes than Rachel Maddow’s boss, MSNBC Comcast, which paid only 24% in taxes on average over the last five years.

Former president Obama’s tax rate for 2015 was only 18.7%.

Mitt Romey’s 2011 tax rate was 14%.

And Socialist Bernie Sanders paid only a 13.5% percent tax rate in 2014.

Even Maddow’s big tease went flat because twenty minutes before she went on air, the White House released this statement:

You know you are desperate for ratings when you are willing to violate the law to push a story about two pages of tax returns from over a decade ago. Before being elected President, Mr. Trump was one of the most successful businessmen in the world with a responsibility to his company, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required. That being said, Mr. Trump paid $38 million dollars even after taking into account large scale depreciation for construction, on an income of more than $150 million dollars, as well as paying tens of millions of dollars in other taxes such as sales and excise taxes and employment taxes and this illegally published return proves just that. Despite this substantial income figure and tax paid, it is totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns. The dishonest media can continue to make this part of their agenda, while the President will focus on his, which includes tax reform that will benefit all Americans.

It was such an epic fail that even The Hollywood Reporter mocked Maddow.

Rachel Maddow may just have helped Donald Trump win reelection in 2020."

A talented comedian and outspoken Republican, his Comedy show “Last Man Standing” has crushed ratings for six straight years. To the shock and surprise of loyal fans, his show was canceled a few days ago.

Supporters of his show and his politics quickly came to the show’s defense. A Change.Org petition was started asking ABC to keep the show. Shortly after, sources told Nation One News that Fox was negotiating to find a spot for the show. Two days later the show’s leadership broke their silence in an exclusive with Variety confirming that they were indeed looking for a new home.

Fortunately, for fans, the show is owned by 20th Century Fox, a subsidiary of Fox. This means the show can be moved to another network or streaming service.

In the face of growing outrage from Conservative ABC viewers, ABC tried to defend the decision saying it wasn’t about politics. According to the Washington Post, Channing Dungey, the Entertainment Group President said:

“There’s a lot of news, and I think that people are definitely looking to television as a place they want to feel, they want to laugh, they want to cry … the mood of the country has told us that television is a little bit of an escape… …What people want to do now is connect and experience and to feel … that did frame a lot of our development thinking this season.”

So, that is the end of story right? No, Not so fast!

The Mainstream Media did not report what Channing Dungey’s said a few months ago. In December 2016, before the inauguration, Channing Dungey reportedly said she was rethinking programming after the Trump victory.

This was less than six months ago. We reached out to ABC for a comment, so far we have received no response from ABC.

At the conference she said:

“…the channel has not paid enough attention to some of the true realities of what life is like for everyday Americans”

She seemed to imply that Trump would not have won if ABC had better control of what “everyday” Americans think.

After what was said in December do you think the decision to cancel Last Man Standing was political? Tell us what you think, and then help us SHARE the truth."

Trump Distances the United States from the Climate Change Scam

Climate change is a serious problem throughout the world. Developing nations dump large amounts of waste into our atmosphere while countries like the United States are held back by restrictions. Those restrictions don’t apply to the worst abusers.

President Trump was conveniently distanced from the worst environmental offenders. He seems to have made it a point to ensure that he wasn’t near the Globalist Elite when the photo was taken. He appeared to start a brief conversation with the Joko Widodo, President of Indonesia right before the photo was taken.

Several Main Stream Media outlets reported that Trump was unable to “shove his way” to the center of the stage. The reports are completely dishonest because President Trump knew exactly where to stand and he never moved. There are a lot of videos on Youtube claiming he tried to steal the spotlight.

The Telegraph created a video showing the moments leading up to the photo. It appears France’s Macron was the person who was trying to steal the spotlight or was Macron just secretly making sure Trump was distanced from the group? Have a look for yourself…

Finally, sources close to the Whitehouse told Nation One News that President Trump was aware of his position in the photo weeks in advance. Another source close to the President recounted part of an internal Whitehouse G-20 planning meeting where Trump said:

“This is great, great news! That picture will show Americans that I am not part of the Globalist crowd hurting America. I might big Big League, but I am not part of that crowd! Americans will understand that I am putting America First! I trust the American people because they trusted me!”

Overall President Trump drew a great deal of criticism about his stance on Climate Change. This was a huge success for Americans who believe that Climate Change is just another way for Globalists to steal American Jobs and strip America of her wealth.

319,https://nationonenews.com/2017/07/09/chicago-diploma.html,nationonenews,"If You Want Your Diploma ""Get A Job!""",[],"Chicago Mayor, Rahm Emanuel, announced new requirements for High School graduates today. He hopes the new rules will improve the already extremely high dropout rate of 30%.

Yes, you read that correctly. The government is adding more rules making it easier for predatory businesses to take advantage of High School graduates. Somehow they believe this will improve the dropout rate.

Beginning in 2020 Students must show they have something to do after High School. They can get a job, join the military, be accepted to college, or join a “gap year” program.

On this surface, this may seem like a good idea. A closer look at numbers tells a different story.

Chicago High School Graduates – New Jobs

In 2016 the Chicago school system announced a record breaking 20,438 graduates. Chicago added 34,400 new jobs in 2016. Sounds great right? NO!

Of the 34,400 jobs created only 7,500 of those jobs were available to High School graduates and even less to inexperienced High School graduates. That leaves the military, college or gap year programs.

The military recruits an average of 100,000 new members each year. That is an average of about 2,000 per state. Of course, some states are higher than others and we do not have access to that information. So, let’s assume that Chicago gets double the national average at 4,000.

So far, we have reached 11,500, which leaves about 9,000 students to college or gap year programs. The national average for college attendance between the ages of 18 and 24 is 33.6%. So this will account for another 6,900.

Chicago will be left with about 2,100 students attending gap year programs… Which leaves just one question.

How much does Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Barack Obama stand to gain from investments into Gap Year Programs?

Here is an idea Mr. Mayor. Bring more jobs to your city and stop creating new industries with your Crony Capitalist laws… Oh wait, but then how would you take advantage of the working poor???"

I don’t know about you, but I know some people who tasted a good bar soap growing up, sure helps remind a few people to keep their mouths clean.

The next four days could perhaps be the beginning of a return to the simple American idea of cooperation and common ground. Freedom Fest is based on one common theme. Working together to solve America’s problems.

Freedom Fest

Freedom Fest is all about respect, discussion, debate, reason, logic, leverage, and problem-solving. Nation One News is known for our entertaining and honest coverage and support of President Donald Trump. We make no apologies for sharing the truth and we look forward to bringing you honest coverage of Freedom Fest 2017.

Over the next four days, we are joining forces with online media. We will deliver in-depth and behind the scenes coverage of this important meeting of minds. To many, it looks like America is being ripped apart by a destructive political storm. Appearances can be deceiving. Amid the political storm, a calm center has formed.

President Trump

Slowly, but surely, President Trump is closing the gap between political extremes in America. Our country is staring down a double barrel crisis. On one side we have extremists who take to the streets destroying property, endangering lives, and towing the socialist line. On the other, extremists threaten to devalue President Trump’s work with their racist worldview and disruptive and unethical demeanor.

The far left and the far right can’t seem to reconcile their differences. Both sides use Trump to promote their causes. The far-left mouthpieces spew fake news, while the far-right damage the reputation of real journalism. In the middle of the storm, you can find the people who will always do what is right for America no matter what.

The Eye of the Storm

The eye of this political storm is growing in size. More and more Americans are seeking the safety, security, and CALM of historical American values. Meaningful discussion and debate about important American issues are happening despite this extremism. As you read this some of the smartest and brightest minds in the country converge on Las Vegas, Nevada. We are here.

You may not hear much about this from the Main Stream Media, but you can count on us to give you a blow by blow account of the hard work that will go down at Freedom Fest 2017.

So far we have counted three “Make America Great Again Hats,” and there are only about 150 people here… This is gonna be GREAT!

In the wake of endless articles about “rumors” from “sources,” the truth came out in the early afternoon hours of Friday, July 21, 2017. Sean Spicer is has resigned as the White Press Secretary, BUT despite several incorrect reports, Anthony Scaramucci is not replacing him.

We have seen no evidence that this change in staff is in any way a scandal, which is a distortion by the Main Stream Media. Several news organizations are screaming “Scandal, Scandal, Scandal.” For example, CNBC released the news with a salacious title that reads “Sean Spicer resigns as White House press secretary after objecting to Scaramucci hire.”

The fact is that Sean Spicer resigned, he was not fired, and he will appear on Fox’s Hannity alongside Scaramucci tonight. Anthony Scaramucci is ACTUALLY REPLACING Michael Dubke who resigned on June 2, 2017. Sean Spicer is being backfilled by Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

Through history, the Whitehouse Press Secretary and Communications Directors don’t last very long. Since Ronald Reagan took office we have seen twelve Press Secretaries and five Presidents. Bill Clinton burned through five all by himself.

Communications Directors are even more likely to have short terms. From Reagan to Obama we saw twenty-three different people walk through the revolving door. As some people at CNN might say, this is:

So, they are having to ask people to donate, to keep them open.

That is how the liberals are censoring speech they don’t like. They created the category of hate speech and are making it illegal, while making sure they are in charge of what is hate speech, which means that the truth is being labeled hate speech. As well as any speech that hurts their feelings and they don’t like.

So, the very unconstitutional thing they are doing is shutting down conservative’s free speech, while maintaining their own free speech, by getting the unethical congressmen to make unconstitutional laws limiting free speech of a targeted group of people.

If we don’t react to it, we will lose it and it will be our fault for letting it happen, because we are the many."

Trump Distances the United States from the Climate Change Scam

Climate change is a serious problem throughout the world. Developing nations dump large amounts of waste into our atmosphere while countries like the United States are held back by restrictions. Those restrictions don’t apply to the worst abusers.

President Trump was conveniently distanced from the worst environmental offenders. He seems to have made it a point to ensure that he wasn’t near the Globalist Elite when the photo was taken. He appeared to start a brief conversation with the Joko Widodo, President of Indonesia right before the photo was taken.

Several Main Stream Media outlets reported that Trump was unable to “shove his way” to the center of the stage. The reports are completely dishonest because President Trump knew exactly where to stand and he never moved. There are a lot of videos on Youtube claiming he tried to steal the spotlight.

The Telegraph created a video showing the moments leading up to the photo. It appears France’s Macron was the person who was trying to steal the spotlight or was Macron just secretly making sure Trump was distanced from the group? Have a look for yourself…

Finally, sources close to the Whitehouse told Nation One News that President Trump was aware of his position in the photo weeks in advance. Another source close to the President recounted part of an internal Whitehouse G-20 planning meeting where Trump said:

“This is great, great news! That picture will show Americans that I am not part of the Globalist crowd hurting America. I might big Big League, but I am not part of that crowd! Americans will understand that I am putting America First! I trust the American people because they trusted me!”

Overall President Trump drew a great deal of criticism about his stance on Climate Change. This was a huge success for Americans who believe that Climate Change is just another way for Globalists to steal American Jobs and strip America of her wealth.

At least he isn’t the kind of person who would go off and do something outrageous. His response to the news that ABC was cutting his show was much more subtle, but none the less a powerful message.

ABC News announced they were cutting Tim Allen’s show “The Last Man Standing.” The announcement to cancel the third most watched comedy show in the history of ABC was a shock to loyal viewers. Frustration and surprise followed the announcement.

Tim Allen didn’t make much of a fuss about it. He just moved on. Although he did use his Twitter account to express his sadness over the show being canceled.

Stunned and blindsided by the network I called home for the last six years. #lastmanstanding — Tim Allen (@ofctimallen) May 16, 2017

Today rumors began to swirl that “Last Man Standing” may continue after all. Sources inside Fox suggest the show will move to Fox and its affiliates along with “certain streaming services.” The show is actually owned by 20th Century Fox, a subsidiary of Fox Entertainment Group a.k.a Fox, not ABC.

ABC has canceled the show, but since it is owned by Fox, Fox can just move it. We are told that negotiations are under way with Fox and their affiliates to find a time for the show on their network. The Official Announcement to come within the next month.

Update Added: 5/23/2017

According to Deadline, the Parent TV Council has now Officially recommended that Fox replaces “The Mick” with “Last Man Standing,” saying:

“it’s a much safer show for families than The Mick and, for that matter, much safer than most programs on air on primetime broadcast television.”

ABC has angered Conservatives by canceling the show. Tim Allen was the clear victim of an attack on Conservatives which will further hurt ABCs bottom line. It looks like the Last Man Standing will be Tim Allen, at a new time and place with Fox.

After you share this, check out this message that Trump has for supporters, you won’t hear about this from the Mainstream Media! ==> ABC and WaPo buried the truth, but Trump dug it up for all to see!"
336,https://nationonenews.com/2017/07/09/chicago-diploma.html#comments,nationonenews,"If You Want Your Diploma ""Get A Job!""",[],"Chicago Mayor, Rahm Emanuel, announced new requirements for High School graduates today. He hopes the new rules will improve the already extremely high dropout rate of 30%.

Yes, you read that correctly. The government is adding more rules making it easier for predatory businesses to take advantage of High School graduates. Somehow they believe this will improve the dropout rate.

Beginning in 2020 Students must show they have something to do after High School. They can get a job, join the military, be accepted to college, or join a “gap year” program.

On this surface, this may seem like a good idea. A closer look at numbers tells a different story.

Chicago High School Graduates – New Jobs

In 2016 the Chicago school system announced a record breaking 20,438 graduates. Chicago added 34,400 new jobs in 2016. Sounds great right? NO!

Of the 34,400 jobs created only 7,500 of those jobs were available to High School graduates and even less to inexperienced High School graduates. That leaves the military, college or gap year programs.

The military recruits an average of 100,000 new members each year. That is an average of about 2,000 per state. Of course, some states are higher than others and we do not have access to that information. So, let’s assume that Chicago gets double the national average at 4,000.

So far, we have reached 11,500, which leaves about 9,000 students to college or gap year programs. The national average for college attendance between the ages of 18 and 24 is 33.6%. So this will account for another 6,900.

Chicago will be left with about 2,100 students attending gap year programs… Which leaves just one question.

How much does Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Barack Obama stand to gain from investments into Gap Year Programs?

Here is an idea Mr. Mayor. Bring more jobs to your city and stop creating new industries with your Crony Capitalist laws… Oh wait, but then how would you take advantage of the working poor???"

This past year with Arnold Schwarzenegger, the show’s rating’s fell to about 5,000,000!

But the former Terminator actor is somehow blaming Trump!

“With Trump being involved in the show people have a bad taste and don’t want to participate as a spectator or as a sponsor or in any other way support the show,” Schwarzenegger said. “It’s a very divisive period now and I think this show got caught up in all that division.”

Fail then blame Trump? Sound familiar?

It makes you wonder if the Globalist Hollywood Executives put the failed governor of California in the Apprentice just to tarnish Donald Trump’s legacy! It won’t matter! President Trump’s legacy will be so much better than his years building the Apprentice!

The next four days could perhaps be the beginning of a return to the simple American idea of cooperation and common ground. Freedom Fest is based on one common theme. Working together to solve America’s problems.

Freedom Fest

Freedom Fest is all about respect, discussion, debate, reason, logic, leverage, and problem-solving. Nation One News is known for our entertaining and honest coverage and support of President Donald Trump. We make no apologies for sharing the truth and we look forward to bringing you honest coverage of Freedom Fest 2017.

Over the next four days, we are joining forces with online media. We will deliver in-depth and behind the scenes coverage of this important meeting of minds. To many, it looks like America is being ripped apart by a destructive political storm. Appearances can be deceiving. Amid the political storm, a calm center has formed.

President Trump

Slowly, but surely, President Trump is closing the gap between political extremes in America. Our country is staring down a double barrel crisis. On one side we have extremists who take to the streets destroying property, endangering lives, and towing the socialist line. On the other, extremists threaten to devalue President Trump’s work with their racist worldview and disruptive and unethical demeanor.

The far left and the far right can’t seem to reconcile their differences. Both sides use Trump to promote their causes. The far-left mouthpieces spew fake news, while the far-right damage the reputation of real journalism. In the middle of the storm, you can find the people who will always do what is right for America no matter what.

The Eye of the Storm

The eye of this political storm is growing in size. More and more Americans are seeking the safety, security, and CALM of historical American values. Meaningful discussion and debate about important American issues are happening despite this extremism. As you read this some of the smartest and brightest minds in the country converge on Las Vegas, Nevada. We are here.

You may not hear much about this from the Main Stream Media, but you can count on us to give you a blow by blow account of the hard work that will go down at Freedom Fest 2017.

So far we have counted three “Make America Great Again Hats,” and there are only about 150 people here… This is gonna be GREAT!

Things are not always what they seem. Take, for example, Democrat Beto O’Rourke. The first thing that comes to mind when I see Beto is how did an Irish American named O’Rourke wind up with a common Hispanic first name like “Beto?”

Beto is the Spanish version of BOB! Most of us who only speak English have no idea. So whats the big deal?

Beto is not his given name. His name is Robert Francis O’Rourke. He is a descendant of Irish immigrants. This guy might be WHITER than I am! You wouldn’t know it from his name…

CNN’s Jim Acosta continues to attack President Trump every chance he gets. Most of the time it results in Fake News. Today was no different!

Earlier this morning Jim Acosta sent out a Tweet, directed at President Trump. In that Tweet, he accused the President of “finally” holding a press conference overseas. He ignored the fact that this only President Trump’s second trip abroad. Then he starts his typical whining about being called “fake news.”

Trump finally held a news conference overseas. But he took a question from a friendly reporter and then attacked CNN as ""fake news."" — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) July 6, 2017

Everyone knows about Jim Acosta’s showboating and his attacks on the President. Do you remember the time he was rude and interrupted Donald Trump? Who can forget, right!?! Donald Trump made it clear back then that he thinks CNN is “fake news.”

The attacks from this CNN Reporter haven’t stopped. After Jim Acosta’s inflammatory Tweet this morning, he took it a step further. He implied that President Trump was holding a “fake news conference” because CNN was not given an opportunity to ask a question.

Isn't it a ""fake news conference"" to take a question from a reporter who is essentially an ally of the White House? https://t.co/vD7DgAZXIv — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) July 6, 2017

It only took a few minutes for the Internet to catch on fire. Conservatives and Liberals both fired back at Jim Acosta. The most notable response was from Donald Trump Jr. He pointed out a very important fact.

If Jim Acosta thinks it is “fake news” when the President won’t take questions from CNN, does that mean every press conference held by Obama was “fake?”

Right away, we open with the experts feel sorry for her because she is married to a Bombastic Billionaire. She is on her way to becoming a Global Icon, they acknowledge. They say she always tuned heads in her home country of Slovenia. She grew up under Communist rule, and claim her father was in the Communist party. Her Mother was a hard worker.

Friends say she didn’t drink or stay up late- or enjoy being the center of attention. She enjoyed her craft and her big dreams. Melania wanted to get into the bigger world. She always loved fashion and modeling. In 1993 she played the first female President.

Melania moved to the US at the age of 24 to pursue modeling. She liked the culture in America. Sept 1998 at 28, she met Donald Trump at a Fashion show. She later reported that she felt he had “Sparkle”. The couple did break up for a little while in 2002 around the time Donald decided to run for office.

Melania tried to stay out of the lime light, except for her modeling career. Once they got back together after their short breakup, they did not break up again. She appears in the movie in Zoolander. There were brief and short appearances on Donald’s reality show.

The couple wed in 2005. She was on the cover of Vouge Magazine in her wedding gown and the couple was on Larry King. She was the Bride of the year in a popular Aflac Commerical. And soon Barron was born. There was a celebrated photo shoot in People Magazine. And Melania loved being a mother. Melania got her citizenship soon after Barron was born. The media had a love affair with everything Donald and Melania Trump. They were celebrated and admired. Her Biographer says that Melania is great for Donald, “Because she is playful and not afraid of him”.

YET- On the left, they hate her..

Perhaps because her husband wanted to be President, on the heels one of their idols. Donald enters the President race, with Melania’s blessing. The author of, The Trump About Trump, says that Melania was reluctant to campaign. Refocusing on Melania’s speech that appeared to be plagiarized from Michelle’s Obama’s speeches. And that is when the nude photos surfaced. The campaign had started against her. Her Immigration status was called into question. She tweeted her defense. Then attention on her college degree. Then again an anti-Trump super pack PRO-Ted Cruz ad, mocking her for her Glamor “Bond Girl” shots.

On twitter the Response to the program is interesting:

btw, CNN got zero access to Melania for special. but that's fine–CNN doing 60-minute infomercial — Eric Boehlert (@EricBoehlert) March 11, 2017

Then the response to the undercover video , where Donald was joking with a friend . Melania was brave enough to defend her husband. Then recall the Pussy Bow at the Debate. The Question remains, did she do it on purpose?

There were accusations of forcible kissing by numerous women. There were reports and retractions and lawsuits. Melania then came out so strongly for American and for Donald Trump.

Stop normalizing these people. Melania is the most useless ""First Lady"" in US history. — JenNJuice (@ZroFoxGivn) March 11, 2017

Melania wears what high fashion media call “Labels of Achievement”. She likes to shop online with a unique style. The FashionIndustryy says that is because she has a “Conflicted” relationship with the Fashion world. For example, she wore a sweater by a designer Derrek Lamb, who refused to dress her, “Because she could afford to buy it”.

She has a classic style. And her forcus is her face and hair, Canessa Friedman says. Even though she is not “Trumpian”, n Canessa’a opinion. Melainia helped design the dress she wore to the Inauguration. She is a “Throphy.”. One designer says she is the Mona Lisa of first Ladies.

But not to the Leftist Establishment Media:

Stop normalizing these people. Melania is the most useless ""First Lady"" in US history. — JenNJuice (@ZroFoxGivn) March 11, 2017

The reports are that Mrs. Trump dazzled the crowds. Yet she did not move to the White House. And now the discussion on Melania’s White House schedule. Although Melania has hired staff and made arrangements to have the East Wing decorated, the number of days Melania spends at the White House is a source of mockery for the left. Another topic that the left attacks Melaina on is her choice of social campaigns , Cyber Bullying.

Toward the end of the show, the interviews turn to digs at Melania for being very private. Overall the show was mostly positive, showing our first lady as strong, independent, beautiful and graceful. There were a few digs at her husband. There were no new interviews of Mrs. Trump.

We can see already that Melania will be loved by everyone except for those on the left who just hate President Trump’s platform of Free Enterprise and Freedom.

Then The White House Dropped the BOOM!,[],"MSNBC’s radical left-wing ideologue Rachel Maddow teased her cable news audience with the scoop of the century. Something that was sure to finally bring down President Donald Trump. It was on par with Geraldo opening Al Capone’s vault.

BREAKING: We've got Trump tax returns. Tonight, 9pm ET. MSNBC. (Seriously). — Rachel Maddow MSNBC (@maddow) March 14, 2017

Half an hour into her show, she dropped the bombshell.

Maddow produced two pages from Donald Trump’s 2005 tax returns . . . thereby proving to the world that then businessman Donald Trump — wait for it — paid his taxes!!!

In fact, he paid a fortune in taxes — $38 million on $150 million of income.

Thank you Rachel Maddow for proving to your #Trump hating followers how successful @realDonaldTrump is & that he paid $40mm in taxes! #Taxes — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 15, 2017

Doing the math, Donald Trump paid about 25% of his earned income in taxes.

Trump paid more in taxes than Rachel Maddow’s boss, MSNBC Comcast, which paid only 24% in taxes on average over the last five years.

Former president Obama’s tax rate for 2015 was only 18.7%.

Mitt Romey’s 2011 tax rate was 14%.

And Socialist Bernie Sanders paid only a 13.5% percent tax rate in 2014.

Even Maddow’s big tease went flat because twenty minutes before she went on air, the White House released this statement:

You know you are desperate for ratings when you are willing to violate the law to push a story about two pages of tax returns from over a decade ago. Before being elected President, Mr. Trump was one of the most successful businessmen in the world with a responsibility to his company, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required. That being said, Mr. Trump paid $38 million dollars even after taking into account large scale depreciation for construction, on an income of more than $150 million dollars, as well as paying tens of millions of dollars in other taxes such as sales and excise taxes and employment taxes and this illegally published return proves just that. Despite this substantial income figure and tax paid, it is totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns. The dishonest media can continue to make this part of their agenda, while the President will focus on his, which includes tax reform that will benefit all Americans.

It was such an epic fail that even The Hollywood Reporter mocked Maddow.

Rachel Maddow may just have helped Donald Trump win reelection in 2020."

We have seen no evidence that this change in staff is in any way a scandal, which is a distortion by the Main Stream Media. Several news organizations are screaming “Scandal, Scandal, Scandal.” For example, CNBC released the news with a salacious title that reads “Sean Spicer resigns as White House press secretary after objecting to Scaramucci hire.”

The fact is that Sean Spicer resigned, he was not fired, and he will appear on Fox’s Hannity alongside Scaramucci tonight. Anthony Scaramucci is ACTUALLY REPLACING Michael Dubke who resigned on June 2, 2017. Sean Spicer is being backfilled by Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

Through history, the Whitehouse Press Secretary and Communications Directors don’t last very long. Since Ronald Reagan took office we have seen twelve Press Secretaries and five Presidents. Bill Clinton burned through five all by himself.

Communications Directors are even more likely to have short terms. From Reagan to Obama we saw twenty-three different people walk through the revolving door. As some people at CNN might say, this is:

Josephine County , OR. —Josephine County, through the County Commissioners who are its governing body, has filed to join two lawsuits that are currently pending in the U.S. District Court for Washington D.C. Both lawsuits allege that federal officials have failed to follow federal laws.

Background:

The United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM) maintains 2,557,800 acres of federal forest land in western Oregon, including 2,151,200 acres that are commonly called the “O&C Lands”. The property is so named because at one point it was briefly owned by the Oregon and California Railroad. Congress passed an act in 1916 that reclaimed the property for public ownership. Congress then passed the “O&C Act” in 1937. The O&C act (43 U.S.C. §1181a) specifies how the federal government is supposed to manage the property.

The O&C Act directs that a portion of revenue from timber sales must be returned to the 18 western Oregon counties in which the O&C lands are located. Josephine County is one of those counties. The O&C Act also directs that, “[O&C lands]…shall be managed…for permanent forest production, and the timber thereon shall be sold, cut, and removed in conformity with the principal [sic] of sustained yield.” Sustained yield basically means harvesting the amount of timber that grows each year, and leaving the rest. For many decades after Congress passed the O&C Act, the BLM achieved an annual sustained yield production of 1.176 billion board feet of timber.

Many family owned forest-products businesses such as sawmills and plywood plants relied on timber sales from O&C lands for their supply of raw materials. These businesses employed large numbers of citizens who in turn paid taxes to fund their local governments and districts. Additionally, the governments of the O&C Counties enjoyed direct revenue from federal timber sales, which offset the taxpayers’ burden.

One of the cases that Josephine County has moved to join is the third in a series of related cases that began in 2010. The cases were brought by a coalition of local timber companies. Swanson Manufacturing Group, LLC from Glendale was one of the original plaintiffs, and thus the case is called “Swanson III” despite the fact that the only original plaintiff that the court continues to recognize is Rough and Ready Lumber. Josephine County moved to join the case in September of 2016. The BLM has opposed Josephine County’s presence in the case, and the court will decide the case’s fate in the coming months.

Swanson III is an important case because the court has previously issued a favorable ruling on the merits. The case is still pending while lawyers argue about technicalities, but in 2013 the court ordered the BLM to abide the legally required target for timber sales. In response to the court’s order, the BLM significantly increased its timber sale program for Fiscal Years 2014 and 2015 on the portion of the O&C property that was addressed by the ruling. The increased sales meant greater activity within the local timber processing industry, and greater revenue for county governments.

Through Swanson III, Josephine County is asking the court to apply its earlier ruling to all of the O&C property, and to order the BLM to temporarily offer even greater increased sales to make up for the years (2004-13) when the agency was out of compliance with federal law.

AFRC v. Jewell

The second case that Josephine County has joined is known as The American Forest Resource Council (AFRC) et al. v. Jewell. Like the plaintiffs in Swanson III, the plaintiffs in AFRC are asking the court to order the BLM to follow federal laws. However, while Swanson III challenges the BLM’s execution of an existing forest management plan, AFRC challenges the BLM’s adoption of a new resource management plan.

Getting favorable rulings on both cases is important not only because Swanson III addresses shortages that occurred in the past, but also because the AFRC court could order the BLM to continue with its current plan while the agency crafts its next proposal.

The Bureau of Land Management’s 2016 plan sets the sustained yield harvest level at 205 million board feet annually. That target is almost a billion board feet lower than the historical average for the O&C property. Thus, Josephine County and its co-plaintiffs are asking the court to order the BLM to abide the sustained yield requirements of the O&C Act. The Act also requires that until such time as the BLM becomes compliant, it must sell at least 500 million board feet of timber every year.

Conclusion

Josephine County is asking a court to order federal officials to follow existing laws. This is a common request which is very different from asking a court to strike down a law for unconstitutionality. The O&C Act directly benefits the citizens and taxpayers of Josephine County, and the Act should be applied in a straightforward manner.

Grants Pass, OR. —First, I wish to thank NewsWithViews for allowing me to submit occasional articles regarding important legal issues that impact our community. I won’t have enough material for monthly submissions, but from time to time I intend to discuss matters that I think will be of interest. Additionally, I welcome questions at feedback@newswithviews.com if you are wondering about something in particular.

Lately there has been a lot of renewed discussion in the local and national media about the laws regarding Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). Therefore, it is worth taking a look at the legal landscape surrounding this topic.

On March 26, 2013, President Barak Obama signed H.R. 933. The bill contained a contentious provision, Section 735 that allowed cultivators of GMOs to continue operating while legal challenges regarding the safety of those crops were being decided. This was probably done in response to a 2010 case in which a federal judge in San Francisco effectively banned the future planting of GMO sugar beets. The bill expired on September 30, 2013, but the debate about GMOs endured.

In the wake H.R. 933, some states, counties and citizens quickly set about creating laws that pertained to GMOs. In October, 2013, Oregon’s legislature and governor passed a bill that designated the state government as the level at which GMO seeds and crops could be regulated. At the time of the Oregon bill’s passage, a citizen’s group in Jackson County was known to have initiated a petition to pass an ordinance that prohibited GMOs there. Jackson County was therefore carved out of the Oregon bill.

Also in 2013, a group of Josephine County citizens initiated a petition to ban GMOs. Like the Jackson County petition, the Josephine County petition received enough signatures to appear before the voters in the May 20, 2014 election. The GMO ordinance received 16,137 votes (58.25%) out of 27,701 cast and went into effect upon passage.

Josephine County’s GMO ordinance declares that it is unlawful to propagate, cultivate, raise, or grow GMOs here, or to knowingly or negligently allow such activities to occur on one’s land, except for purposes of research. The ordinance also says that the Board of County Commissioners may designate a Code Enforcement Officer to administer and enforce its provisions. To date, the county has not opted to appoint a person to that specific post.

The ordinance states that the Code Enforcement Officer may take necessary actions required by law (such as obtaining a search warrant) to obtain access to private property. In accordance with due process, the official can collect samples of materials that are suspected to be GMO. Any GMOs the official finds may be confiscated, quarantined, and destroyed in accordance with due process. The cost of doing so may be imposed on the responsible parties.

On April 29, 2015, the Board of County Commissioners assigned ordinance number 2014-007 to the measure that was passed by the voters. The measure requires the county to make reasonable efforts to provide initial notification of the ordinance to farming operations within Josephine County. The Board therefore sent this notification (hyperlink to the notification) to the Grants Pass Daily Courier, the Illinois Valley News, and to the granges. The notice requires anyone who is currently growing GMOs to report their activities to the Sheriff before September 4, 2015.

Currently, Congress is considering H.R. 1599. The official bill summary states in part, “This bill preempts state and local restrictions on GMOs or GMO food and labeling requirements for GMOs, GMO food, non-GMO food, or “natural” food.” Preempt means “prevent”. The bill passed the U.S. House of Representatives on July 23, 2015, and is now in the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.

As your county legal counsel I will continue to stay on top of the laws surrounding GMO. Contact me any time at the courthouse if you wish to discuss this issue further.

By NWV Senior Political News Writer, Jim Kouri

President Donald Trump’s defensive action to protect the United States and the American people from radical Muslims seeking entry into the country was given at least a temporary go-ahead by the U.S. Supreme Court. The ruling was rendered by a 7-2 decision on Monday.

Trump’s executive order met with an enormous negative response by Democrats and the mainstream news media which intentionally misrepresented what was intended by the administration’s effort to prevent terrorist attacks like those occurring in France, Belgium, Germany, United Kingdom, Turkey and other NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) member nations.

The nation’s highest court declared that lower court injunctions put in place against Trump’s so-called travel ban — plainly a misnomer — prevented the government from initiating enforcement of any of the challenged provisions.

In demanding a stay of those injunctions, the government cited the compelling likelihood of irreparable harm: “Pointing to the descriptions of conditions in the six designated nations, the government argues that a 90-day pause on entry is necessary to prevent potentially dangerous individuals from entering the United States while the executive reviews the adequacy of information provided by foreign governments in connection with visa adjudications. Additionally, the government asserts, the temporary bar is needed to reduce the executive’s investigative burdens while this review proceeds.”

Seven of the nine SCOTUS justices agreed with that argument.

The six nations involved and stipulated in Trump’s executive order are all Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. Those nations are in the Middle East and North Africa.

Additional provisions ban entries more than 50,000 refugees from war-torn countries such as Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan for fiscal year 2017. It also directs the Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly to determine whether foreign governments provide verified information about nationals applying for U.S. visas.

Democratic Party and News Media Hysteria

On January 27, 2017, President Donald J. Trump signed Executive Order No. 13769, Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States. 82 Fed. Reg. 8977 (EO–1). EO–1 addressed policies and procedures relating to the entry of foreign nationals into this country.

Among other directives, the order suspended entry of foreign nationals from seven countries identified as presenting heightened terrorism risks—Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen—for 90 days. Executive officials were instructed to review the adequacy of current practices relating to visa adjudications during this 90-day period.

EO–1 also modified refugee policy, suspending the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for 120 days and reducing the number of refugees eligible to be admitted to the United States during fiscal year 2017.

When Muslim organizations, Democrats and members of the news media displayed their outrage and misinformed the American voters, the most left-wing judges in the country provided Trump’s opponents with two temporary restraint decisions.

EO–1 was immediately challenged in court. Just a week after the order was issued, a Federal District Court entered a nationwide temporary restraining order enjoining enforcement of several of its key provisions.

Washington v. Trump, 2017 WL 462040 (WD Wash., Feb. 3, 2017). Six days later, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied the Government’s emergency motion to stay the order pending appeal. Washington v. Trump, 847 F. 3d 1151 (2017). Rather than continue to litigate EO–1, the Government announced that it would revoke the order and issue a new one.

A second executive order followed on March 6, 2017. See Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States, Exec. Order No. 13780, 82 Fed. Reg. 13209 (EO–2).

EO–2 describes “conditions in six of the . . . countries” as to which EO–1 had suspended entry, stating that these conditions “demonstrate [that] nationals [of those countries] continue to present heightened risks to the security of the United States,” and that “some of those who have entered the United States through our immigration system have proved to be threats to our national security.”

On the “First Monday in October” — traditionally the day the SCOTUS reconvenes each year — the Supreme Court will revisit the so-called travel ban.

Elmers Restaurant, Tuesday, April 4, 6:00 PM.

Diann is an Alaska native, Haida Indian and Native American, Cherokee. She moved to Eugene in 1996 from Alaska. She Became Lane County coordinator for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign because she knew if he wasn’t elected president we would lose America. She said, “when he came down the escalator at Trump Tower to announce his presidency, I witnessed a man who loved America and wanted to protect her borders, restore law and order – most of all restore our pride in being “Americans, one nation under God!

He wanted to “make America great again.” I come from one of the most radical, extremist democratic cities in America – Eugene, Oregon. Yet, I convinced Donald Trump to come to Eugene where 16,000 people showed up for his rally, we turned half away, not enough room. To me this was the turning point in Oregon’s political landscape. I witnessed people coming out to see him who are hungry for a change in Oregon. And Donald Trump lost by 10% to Hillary!!! This is not a hard percentage to overcome in 2018 election.

This is why Diann has come to speak at Josephine county. To unify Republicans and undeclared voters. 662,000 registered Republicans. 660,000 undeclared voters. President Trump pulled 782,000.

Oregon hit a record 2 million, but one and five voters tossed out their ballots. 540,000 -And no one has gone to these registered voters who tossed out or ignored the ballots they received. This is what we need to do, because we need 350,000 more voters to remove the democratic control in our Senate and House, remove Governor Brown, PERS, Merkley, in 2018!

Our governor has issued a call to Oregonians to join her anti-Trump campaign. I am sending out a press release accepting her challenge. I am calling for Trump supporters – – the forgotten man and woman in Oregon to join us. This is kicking off her campaign for 2018. Since she cannot run on her abysmal failures and policies, and her governorship has been racked with one scandal after another. She chooses to focus on President Trump only because she has no record or a record that’s riddled with failures. There won’t be a contest if we get into a debate with her publicly.

We will issue a proclamation to Oregonians, “you the forgotten man and woman will be forgotten no longer!” This was Trump’s proclamation. This is how will we will defeat evil in Salem.

One by one our politicians have closed timber operations, mining and fish operations because of extreme environmental regulations. The wealth of our middle class in Oregon has been ripped from homes and then re-distributed as in socialistic countries who are in deep poverty. Oregon is one of those states in deep debt and ignores the needs of its people.

President Trump said, “we will no longer accept politicians Who are all talk and no action – – complaining constantly but never doing anything about it.” The time for empty promises is over in Oregon – now arises our hour of action in Oregon!

We must take our message to the forgotten man and woman. Those that are disenfranchised, powerless against the political machine in Salem who is bleeding it’s taxpayers paying for big government through it’s PERS , Illegal immigrants who are draining the healthcare system, education, housing: for Oregonians who give up family vacations, buying homes, even buying their children new school clothes.

We must band together and our voices will be heard at the ballot box in 2018 because we must go to those 540,000 who feel left out, and powerless, we must tell them they are the power of change!!!

Let’s issue them the same promise that President Trump gave to all Americans, “I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down. Oregon will start winning again. We will bring back jobs to Oregon. We will bring back our borders and our wealth, and our dreams!” We will cut Business taxes which will allow businesses to flourish!

For too long, a small group in Salem’s Capital have reaped the rewards of government, their death spiraling PERS Program, where one retiree receives, $32,000 a month, while we, the taxpayers have born the cost, and we the people in Oregon do not share in its wealth. In closing, I will quote President Trump.

“We assemble here in Josephine County today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, every rural community, in every hall of power, from this day forward, it’s going to be only Oregonians first, and America first”.

The World According to Luksha and Why Are Soviets Re-Engineering the Future?

In a dual education system, who determines who will be “educated” and those who will only be taught “functional literacy” in vocational services? The 1992 U.S. Department of Labor controversial SCANS Report, advocating controlling future “human capital” as each person’s assigned worth or worthlessness to the economy, is coming to fruition. Luksha describes the new global digital world to MIT observers in the following links: (Source-1) and (Source-2)

At the GEFF conference (Global Education Futures Forum) held in Menlo Park, CA in April of 2015 Luksha explained in detail what he has to offer the world as far as what the future in education would look like in the year 2035. The key to accomplishing longterm economic goals, education and technology were the main focus. The following links to this roadmap explore their ideas. (Source-1) and (Source-2) and (Source-3)

Many goals , I’m sure, will not be so easily accomplished in America. In fact their “future map” shows that there are many ethical and legal questions that have not been thoroughly thought out to become a reality in the land of the free. However, the push for global “deliberative democracy” is moving forward unhampered and unquestioned.

But one very important issue for the world to understand when looking at this plan is that these secular-humanist scientists scour and scrub the world to make it free of religion, or to make it a more accepting world religion with flexible morality and worldviews. They quote Karen Armstrong speaking at a TED talk about the community helping to build a “Charter for Compassion — to restore the Golden Rule as the central global religious doctrine.”

Values are to be taught by online virtual game apps that form common values, not churches. Child labor laws would have to be changed for the Mickey Mouse Club Law, legislation introduced for early intellectual labor, 10 years old and up. A Billion Student University emerges with IT companies consuming the roll as the leaders of the Global Education Market, not universities. The definition of a new “modernist family” will need “competent” parenting training, and a shift in the childhood model to a more flexible morality. This includes opening the door at a younger biological age to an ever expanding range of activities (education, business and political activities, sexual activity, right to access pharmacological “cognitive intensifiers,” etc. Well, are we ready for this? Does the Luksha agenda normalize all sexual activity like pedophilia, transgenderism, sexual predators, and homosexuality? Is there such a thing as a child’s consent to sexual activity?

(NOTE: The following link provided is a must read for the entire concept of Russian Futurist plans for America and the world.

The new family and a shift in the childhood model, page 60.

The extent of what the controlling factors are, and of which values gets implanted and who decides what that information will contain, will totally be controlled by top technology companies. This will curtail free and open sources of knowledge or scholars. We should question WHO is writing and analyzing the algorithms, and WHAT values and WHAT curriculum WILL be taught? Turning Western civilization on its head will ultimately convert moral, social, and aesthetic values to a more transformational acceptance of what is right/wrong, good/bad, or beautiful/ugly. Western society will be scrubbed of social norms, ethical values, traditional customs, belief systems, or a moral compass. Sin is erased. I’m OK, you’re OK, or what kids say today…whatever!

What Does the Future Hold?

Elon Musk of TESLA is preparing to link human brains with computers in 4 years. “Artificial intelligence and machine learning will create computers so sophisticated and godlike that humans will need to implant ‘neural laces’ in their brains to keep up,” Musk said last year. Over the top? Maybe. (Source)

Bryan Johnson, the founder and CEO of neuroscience startup Kernel, is trying to hack the human brain. And Facebook investor Yury Milner envisions a global brain with collective intelligence. The Matrix may not be too far away. (Source)

It is all very clear. The real coverup concerns the intel from Russia that is being used by US tech companies. The future of our education would be intertwined with neural brain research. The Alife agenda (artificial life) will control human behavior and what information would be fed through the cloud-based Internet of things. Cathy O’Neil, Harvard Ph.D. warns of big data’s dark side in ‘Weapons of Math Destruction’ states overtly, “Don’t Trust That Algorithm?” (Source)

However, this is a warning: Whoever compiles the algorithms, (Google, Intel, Facebook, Tesla, Microsoft, Cisco) will decide what the standards will be and what information will be available to “download” into your brain. After all, an algorithm is an opinion, and the opinion of developers will determine the standard of what will be taught by machine learning, and what information will be provided and shared. Education becomes selective, conditioned, and discriminating in this new world order. (More on Algorithms in Part 4.)

This brief overview gives you the importance of understanding this controlled universal collective intelligence drafting the pathway to digital globalization brought to you by Hillary Clinton, Zuckerberg, and their Russian cohort, and other SkolKovo friends, like Pavel Luksha. This is a closer look at the Global Future Agenda of transhumanism. Please read the entire synopsis of what the future will bring in the techno-religiousity, immoral future that is being portrayed merging humanity with technology while destroying the family. [Link]

It was a spontaneous event with historical significance. According to Faith Leader Johnnie Moore, a group of ministers were in the White house for an all-day meeting on policy that did not involve the leader of the free world. President Trump learned that they were there and insisted that they come to the Oval Office to say “hi.”

President Trump, who has an excellent relationship with faith leaders was more than willing when they offered to lay hands on him and pray for his success and safety as well as thanking God for placing him in the most powerful office in the world by overpowering a totally rigged election. That election was so rigged that the world was shocked when the results came in.

California Governor Moonbeam (Jerry Brown) made a rule that all illegals in the state could vote since voting is taking a valid part in a country you wish to be a part of. And vote they did. Over 2-3 million illegals cast their votes for Hillary. A knuckle-headed Virginia governor ordered a bill that would allow, now listen to this, all convicted felons to vote (for Hillary).That resulted in over 40,000 additional votes for the Hill on the Hill.

(A convicted felon loses his right to vote.) Voting machines, manufactured by George Soros flipped votes from Trump to Hillary…this has been documented. We’ve done our homework.

Of course the George Soros owned news media pulled every possible slam technique to make every single line with Trump in the story negative. With this latest nonsense one can see that the Soros Democrats can even turn praying for someone into a negative.

Clergy praying for the President of The United States was a part of America from her founding. They wanted a country of morals, integrity, character, honesty, and a belief and love of God, They wanted our lives to be patterned on the principles of The Bible. The founders, many of them clergymen understood fully that a country based upon the above noted principles would be a strong country, even in the face of enemies who may try to do us harm. And no country could defeat us until we began mocking God, celebrating perversion and riotous living while working to get the Bible out of sight.

It became illegal to have Bibles and prayer in schools. The term, Christmas, was banned and Christmas programs became, ‘Winter Celebrations.’ The following year following the banning of the Bible and Prayer, the crime rate increased over 300%.That percentage has continued to climb ever since.

As the result, our country became a land of chaos. Child rape is not only a common occurrence but indeed an expected one. RECENTLY three immigrant Muslim kids who had been brought into America and put up in an apartment, viciously and violently raped a little five year old girl in Twin Falls, Idaho. Not content with that these Muslim savages also urinated in the little child’s mouth.

We have just learned the outcome of that outrage. Those punks did not get one day in prison or even at a juvenile facility. They were simply let go with no punishment. Even more outrageous, the Obama appointed State Attorney General made a public statement that anyone who makes a negative statement about the Muslim refugees will be charged and punished.

This is a result of pushing God, the Bible, morality and Christianity out of our lives. There was a time when people showed respect for each other, were polite, honest and did not parade their sins publicly for the world to see. Talk about thumbing ones’ nose at God. That will not continue without severe consequences.

So at last, during the worst time of our history, we saw clergy laying their hands in prayer over our new President. Some photos were taken by Johnnie Moore, a former vice president of Jerry Falwell’s Liberty University, one used in this story, and a couple others were released on Twitter. This group inlcuded Vice President Mike Pence and top Presidential Adviser Jared Kushner . Moore is the author of: “Defying ISIS: Preserving Christianity in the Place of its Birth and in Your Own Backyard.”

Interesting, it is OK to defile the White House with rainbow colors celebrating the sin of homosexuality covering the People’s House, and to bring in anarchists and criminals, but bring in God and all hell comes alive. Here are some of the reactions from the Communist Democrat-progressives regarding praying in The White House:

CNN (Communist News Network) jumped into action immediately when that tweet got out about the prayers in the White House, by tying to convince their sucker-audiences that this proves the allegations of collusion between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government, which authorities believe (no “authorities” listed”) conducted a cyberwar and hacking campaign in a bid to disrupt the November election.

How’s that again? What does one have to do with the other? This is nuts! So praying for someone proves that Trump colluded with Russia to swing our election over to Hillary? Now we’ve heard it all. What’s more, other idiotic comments state that this entire prayer business in the White House is a cover up for “Russian Collusion,” and “this has all knocked the entire White House off Balance,” preached The Washington Post and The New York Times--All the fake news that’s not fit to print. We suppose this statement would prove that prayer is powerful

It gets even nuttier. When the twitter photo went out, the Dems went into a hissy fit sending vulgar curse words to Johnnie Moore who said these were the vilest messages he had ever received. And this was all over him praying with the president.

The image of prayer in the White House immediately sparked an angry backlash, including allegations that Moore is somehow racist for having a better relationship with Trump than with his predecessor. We knew racism had to get in here somehow.

The Democrats, who are experts at twisting every event in our society, are conniving, cunning schemers who are so uneducated that they have no idea how this New One World Government that they are pushing so hard to achieve will affect their own lives.

They are so misled and uninformed that they would probably try to get rich selling Songs without Words. Wait! Isn’t that basically what they are doing now?

What we saw at the White House this past Tuesday was totally correct, proper, and encouraging. I’m sure those pastors who prayed with the President also gave thanks to God for performing the miracle that put him in office, yes, I too believe, with the deck stacked the way it was for the most wicked candidate in history, almost fool proof, that prayers were answered as millions upon millions of people were up early every morning playing an Abrahamic prayer asking God’s intervention.

And against all odds, God stepped in and answered those prayers, the prayers that astonished the world. Russia had nothing to do with Trump’s victory. It was The Hand of God that stepped in and propelled millions of voters to head to the polls.

Moore said evangelicals “have a wide open door like never before into this administration,” and suggested progressives will have to make peace with the fact that the president of the United States openly prays with leading evangelicals. This is good news for millions of people, with the exception of the Democrat Communists, Satanists, LGBT, Progressives and deviants.

“This wasn’t the first time, it won’t be the last time,” Moore said. “And the principle promise that evangelicals have made to the president, the vice president, and the administration is that millions of us will be praying for him every day.”

All of us have a profound duty to pray for our president, to get back to church-if you hear a distortion of The Holy Scriptures or any of that New Age crap at any time, RUN, don’t walk to the nearest exit, then go find a church that preaches the uncompromised Gospel of Jesus Christ. Then join a Bible study group. Base your life on the principles of the Bible.

We now have a president who will stand with the Christians and the ministers. We have been miraculously given a second chance. Let’s not blow it. Let only God be the authority of your life

It is rare in these days to see such unashamed anti-Zionism displayed loud and proud by a seemingly conservative author, whose language and arguments are, however, more appropriate to the vile socialist left. Mr. Baldwin resorts to demagoguery by mixing together both valid and very invalid issues, i.e., anti-Zionism rants. [Link]

It is surely a valid observation that the spread of homosexuality in America is not confronted enough by our spiritual leaders, and worse, some priests and rabbis pander to and fear the homosexual Mafia more than God.

Yet, it is wrong and ugly to speak about Zionism as though something reprehensible.(*) It is wrong to blame renowned pastors such as John Hagee for their friendliness to the State of Israel and for being a Christian Zionist. In fact, every consistent Christian must be a Christian Zionist as I will explain. And, it is particularly ugly to blame the President-elect Donald J. Trump, for his promises to honor the rights of Israel for her land and capital, while the entire world, pandering to the left and Islam, have turned hatred against the Jewish Homeland.

It is both base and ugly to sarcastically characterize the year 2017 and Trump’s presidency as though it represents “The Year of the Zionists.” Your language, Pastor Baldwin, is no different than that of the Soviet Politburo. What a badge of honor you wear!

Let me clarify some of the basics of Zionism for you, Pastor Baldwin.

1) In a secular sense, Zionism is merely a case of the general formula that “Nation X belongs to people X” just as France belongs to the French, Britain belongs to the Brits, Germany to Germans, Spain to Spaniards, Greece to the Greeks, and yes, Israel to the Jews! Zionism is no different than Frenchism, Germanism, etc., except that the Jews ownership of their land began 3,000 years ago, before France, Britain, and Germany even existed.

2) The restoration of Israel on her ancient land is an act of immense significance in terms of both social and spiritual justice. Since ancient times, Israel has been a victim of colonialism and oppression. Therefore, as a social issue, Zionism is the most justified case of a national liberation movement, one which delivered the Jewish people, victims of extreme oppression and genocide for centuries, to their national liberation and the restoration of their nationhood.

3) As a spiritual issue, Zionism is a realization of God’s plan, an act of the highest spiritual value for Jews and consistent Christians. Yet, Israel is the only nation refused basic justice by the rest of the world, the world which was ready to sacrifice Israel for whatever minute reason, or for no reason at all. Any expectations of justice for Israel from this world are futile (Eric Hoffer).

To be a Zionist is a badge of honor. That is Zionism. To be an anti-Zionist is a mark of baseness.

4) Pastor Baldwin, you are saying that contemporary Israel is not exactly like the model promised by God…fair enough. However, who else is such a model? Whose existence, security, and national interests are questioned and conditioned by other foreign nations? Here is a quote for you. Remember Europe in the 1930s?

Ask yourself this:

• Is it possible for the whole world to be against Jews? Yes.

• Is it possible that the whole world can be wrong? Yes.

• What was the motivating factor then? Antisemitism.

• What is the motivating factor today? Antisemitism.

• Then the world opposed the existence of one Jew.

• Today the world opposes the existence of one Jewish state.

Back then, the world opposed the existence of one Jew. Today, the world opposes the existence of one Jewish State. And yet you are concerned with 2017 being “The Year of the Zionists” for America.

5) America was founded as a Judeo-Christian nation, not anything else. It is a spiritual obligation of America to take the side of Christians and Jews in world affairs. And, it is in America’s national interests to support Israel, the only free nation in the Middle East, and America’s strongest ally in the region.

As Eric Hoffer wrote in 1968 “Israel is our only reliable and unconditional alley. We can rely more on Israel than Israel can rely on us.” [Link] These bitter words are even more true now. And you, Pastor Baldwin, are displeased already about future actions of President Donald J. Trump towards making America a more reliable and honest ally of Israel! Shame on you and your ministry!

(*) It is very puzzling and illogical of the hatred to Israel by Western nations and some of their so-called conservatives. Their actions and reasoning exactly replicate the Soviet Politburo.

Soviets hated Israel for too many reasons. First of all, because she allied with America and the West rather than with the Soviets, and because the Soviets hated the very possibility that some small fraction of their population may even contemplate the idea of leaving the USSR for good, or even to be somehow associated with Jewry in the external world. This is the exact reason that Soviets made Zionism a curse word, and a reason for persecution in the USSR! Even learning Hebrew could trigger criminal prosecution back then.

Indeed, the KGB created the PLO, Arafat and the so-called “Palestinian people,” (trained in various Soviet military camps, including one near Odessa, the city where I lived.) And, indeed, it was Soviets who promoted the UN resolution equating Zionism and Fascism (a gross cynicism in itself). But that was the USSR.

To imagine that anyone in the West would follow the same propaganda line is unthinkable! It is as if the West borrowed the Soviet talking points for bashing the allies of the West such as South Vietnam, South Korea, or West Germany! And yet, the West, and some of western conservatives, did borrow the Soviet talk points to bash Israel. That is a grotesque reality these days.

Mary and I are in a van with the Conservative Campaign Committee team headed to Georgia.

The Georgia Trump-resistance candidate Jon Ossoff is leading in the polls against Republican Karen Handel in the June 20th congressional special election. A Facebook patriot sister in Georgia gave me a heads up that guys wearing pink Planned Parenthood shirts were in her neighborhood putting Ossoff literature on doorknobs.

Losing every special election, Democrats are desperate to energize their fake America-regrets-electing-Trump narrative. Leftists continue to pour millions into the Georgia race, putting all their hate-Trump eggs into Ossoff’s basket.

In typical Democrat bait-and-switch fashion, Ossoff is running as a moderate. In reality, Ossoff is an extreme far left radical, backed by off-beat anti-America groups from Occupy Wall Street to Black Lives Matter and numerous other counter-culture weirdo groups; rabidly obsessed with bringing down Trump.

Isn’t the whole idea of Democrats boldly launching a Trump-resistance movement pretty outrageous? Remember the media firestorm over Rush Limbaugh saying he hoped Obama’s agenda failed? Leftists practically demanded that Rush be removed from the air and crucified in the public square, stabbed through the heart with his golden EIB microphone. Rush was excoriated for being a traitor to his country.

And yet, fake news media is orchestrating and praising the Trump-resistance movement as on the moral high ground. These people on the Left who are consumed with out-of-control rage over Hillary losing the election do not give a rat’s derriere about their blatant hypocrisy.

Speaking of Hillary, she’s back! Hillary hit the airways spewing more anti-Trump bitterness to keep the flames of hate, rage and insanity burning in her minions. My fellow patriot Americans, we must remain extremely vigilant in our efforts to keep these Leftist wackos out of power. I still scratch my head, puzzled over what Leftists feel they must so passionately resist from Trump’s presidency.

Why is Trump proclaiming his desire to “make America great again” as repulsive to Leftists as showing Dracula the cross? If you are a Leftist, wouldn’t you still want your country, your homeland to be made great? These people are simply not right in the head folks.

The Left has gone totally insane. Cable news has become 24/7 destruction of Trump. It is as if nothing in the world matters other than removing Trump from office.

On Fox News, Bill Bennett noted how fake news media was far more outraged over the Montana Republican candidate tussling with a reporter than they were over the 22 people killed in the Manchester terrorist attack and 26 Coptic Christians murdered in Egypt. Fake news media’s passion and interest is only in events which further its Trump-must-be-removed narrative. Clearly, they have lost their minds, obsessed beyond reason.

A majority of Americans, 65%, believe the media publishes fake news. In a Montana store, I overheard an employee expressing her support of Trump to another employee. She said she believes nothing reported in the media.

Fake news media have thrown all pretense of being fair and balanced out the window. They are in full-court-press remove Trump mode. My bottom line is it is us against them, folks. Thanks and may God bless you for your faithful support of our efforts. I’ll report in again from Georgia.

By Senior Political News Writer, Jim Kouri

April 24, 2017

A school board in the United States that refuses to allow any symbols or images regarding Christmas and the birth of Jesus Christ, voted to allow an outside group of Muslim activists to begin the process of indoctrination of young American children, according to a former police official, Norman Thomas Gargan, who served as a training adviser in Iraq.

Members of the Board of the Unified San Diego School District voted last week to cooperate with the Council on American-Islam Relations (CAIR) in their introduction of a number of precepts of Sharia law in classrooms throughout the school district, according to Gargan and other law enforcement sources.

“This is just the beginning, a test case to see if they get away with this. And believe me, it’s coming to your school next.” said Editor Paul Walter

“What amounts to out-and-out brainwashing of school children will begin with rationalizing such blatant religious indoctrination as be part of an anti-bullying program to protect Muslims. The program, which is designed by CAIR, will probably find its way into other cities and towns within California,” noted former police detective and security director Patricia Caramando. “It will spread — take my word for it — across the United States, which is part of their plan. The school board members sound as if they’s watched MSNBC one too many times,” she added.

According to the Homeland Security Department, about 25,000 refugees and their families have been resettled in southern California just this year. Many have also moved from their U.S. homes to the Golden State due to the generosity of state and city officials.

Det. Caramando added that she believes “San Diego is considered an excellent location for a variety of reasons to institute a Sharia-friendly base of operations for the already far-left-leaning California.”

This is video of the statement by the executive director of the SD office of CAIR.

Whether they call themselves Marxist or not, the Board of the San Diego Unified School District is dominated by those who have a cultural Marxist mentality. On April 4, 2017 they voted to blatantly promote Islam in the public schools. These anti-bullying projects are just an excuse to indoctrinate the kids in a pro-Islam, anti-American ideology. This is the entire section of the meeting, in which they discussed this topic and made a decision.

Mr. Hanif Mohebi, the executive director of CAIR’s San Diego facility, hails the anti-bullying program approved by the Board of the San Diego as a means to make SDUSD the most Islam-friendly school district in America (if done right, he says).

Mohebi is associated with the Islamic Center of San Diego, where the staff aided two of the 9/11 terrorists, who flew the jet liner into the Pentagon. Of course, it’s often pointed out that CAIR was an unindicted co-conspirator in the Holy Land Foundation terror trial.

The United Arab Emirates has also designated CAIR as a terrorist organization.

On Monday, the nation’s new Attorney General Jeff Sessions held a press briefing in which he reiterated the Trump administration’s plans for dealing with criminal aliens. On of his points was the often quoted warning that any city observing a sanctuary policy for illegal aliens, especially criminal aliens, will very possibly lose some federal financial assistance.

While the Democrats, the news media and immigration activists were prepared to slam Sessions and his boss, President Donald Trump, they discovered that Sessions spoke about continuing some of the Obama administration’s policies regarding immigration. Mr. Sessions’ Justice Department underlings had also told reporters that any changes in policy or new executive orders will probably take place down the road.

Although the Obama administration issued instructions about immigration enforcement in July 2016 during the presidential race between Trump and the eventually defeated Hillary Clinton — including the stipulation that any cities applying for Justice Department grant programs must be in compliance with federal law including immigration enforcement — President Barack Obama and his minions did nothing to back up his proclamations or his verbal instructions.

Sessions noted that local governments applying for grants from the Justice Department will be required to prove their compliance. Sessions also said that the Justice Department in the future will look into additional measures for both federal and local government agencies.

“Fundamentally, we intend to use all the lawful authority we have to make sure that our state and local officials, who are so important to law enforcement, are in sync with the federal government,” Sessions stated during the televised briefing.

While Sessions appeared to keep his presentation low-key, he did warn local governments in the midst of adopting “sanctuary” status of the consequences of their actions.

For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness. None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity. —Isaiah 59:3-4 KJV

Comey, Rosenstein and Mueller

While everyone is looking at Robert Mueller as the culprit in this witch hunt of our President, we had better take a closer look at Rosenstein, the Deputy AG who appointed Mueller as special counsel for the DOJ and establishment infiltration. Comey, Rosenstein and Mueller are long time affiliates.

Never Trumpers Infiltrate Administration

Roger Stone feels that the Never Trumpers have infiltrated the administration via Reince Priebus, but I believe VP Pence is also responsible. How else does one explain CFR member, Dina Habib Powell, best friend of Valerie Jarrett, Huma Abedin, and CFR member Condoleezza Rice? Powell is Arabic and a former Goldman Sachs employee. She is the current U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategy to President Donald Trump under McMaster. She is also an Assistant to the President and Senior Counselor for Economic Initiatives.

Powell is being promoted by Jared and Ivanka to be our President’s next Chief of Staff, yet throughout her career Powell has opposed everything Trump stands for. As Stone says, this would be jumping from the frying pan into the fire, when there are already way too many quislings in the administration whose allegiance belongs, not to Donald Trump, but to the RNC, and that appears to be true for Rod Rosenstein.

Rod Rosenstein, Deputy AG

Harvard graduate Rosenstein was nominated by President Donald Trump to serve as Deputy Attorney General for the United States DOJ on January 13, 2017. Rosenstein was confirmed on April 25, 2017. This certainly does not mean he’s a conservative, or an anti-globalist.

I would love to know who suggests these people, and then who vets them for our President…perhaps Pence and Priebus? There are only a few in this administration who are truly conservative, and one of them is already gone, General Michael Flynn, and several others never even made it to confirmation.

Rosenstein is being hailed as a brilliant choice who is admired and respected and completely free of controversy. Excuse me, but wasn’t Comey hailed with the same exact rhetoric before he angered the left, and disappointed the right?

Leftist Slate Magazine stated that Rosenstein would be a good check against Jeff Sessions, and the Washington Com-Post even called Rosenstein a fabulous choice for the position and completely free of controversy! Bah Humbug! Obviously, he’s an establishment insider if these leftist rags love him.

Rosenstein and Mueller

Rosenstein joined the U.S. Department of Justice through the Attorney General’s Honors Program. From 1990 to 1993, he prosecuted public corruption cases as a trial attorney with the Public Integrity Section of the Criminal Division, then led by Assistant Attorney General Robert Mueller. They’ve been joined at the hip for a long, long time.

Mueller and Rosenstein are both part of the “Deep State.” In fact, as Stone reports, both of them have ties to the Bush machine. Remember the Clinton theft of FBI documents? Craig Livingstone, director of the White House Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background reports concerning several hundred individuals without asking permission.

Mueller served as clean up man for Bill and Hillary Clinton. As independent counsel from 1995 to 1997, he found no criminal prosecution against White House officials who had rummaged through FBI records to get background reports in the use of political blackmail.

In 2001, top Justice Department official Lee J. Radek, roundly criticized for steering the China gate probe away from the White House, had a friend in Robert S. Mueller, President Bush’s pick to replace FBI Director Louis Freeh. Radek ran the campaign finance task force that was charged with looking into rampant 1996 Clinton-Gore fund-raising abuses that included Chinese money-laundering and possible influence-peddling. Many branded Radek a “bureaucrat” who was more interested in throttling the case against the Clinton White House, and thereby keeping his job, than pushing it. Mueller even received a glowing endorsement from China cheerleaders like Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Hillary Clinton. [Link]

In the 1990s, Rosenstein was on a team of prosecutors appointed by Kenneth Starr to investigate Bill and Hillary Clinton’s “Whitewater” business dealings in Arkansas. In 2012, Attorney General Eric Holder tapped him to investigate national security leaks to news outlets, a response to heavy criticism of the Obama administration by congressional Republicans. Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr exonerated both President Clinton and the First Lady with respect to the FBI files matter in 1998. And Ken Starr is telling the President not to fire Mueller.

Clintons and Comey

In the mid-1990s, Comey joined the Senate Whitewater Committee as a deputy special counsel. There he dug into allegations that the Clintons took part in a fraud connected to an Arkansas real estate venture gone bust. No charges were ever brought against either Clinton, but the scandal would eventually lead to independent counsel Kenneth Starr’s probe that would result in the Lewinsky scandal.

How about the Sandy Berger affair? Former National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, who was sentenced in 2005 to two-years’ probation and fined $50,000 as the result of a plea bargain, for stealing highly classified documents from the National Archives and intentionally destroying some of them. He had also been functioning as a Hillary Clinton campaign adviser before his death last December.

James Comey, was the deputy attorney general in the Justice Department, and apparently limited the scope of the criminal investigation of Sandy Berger. The documents Berger stole basically proved Bill Clinton could have gone after and killed Osama bin laden, but didn’t, proving he was negligent in the build-up to the 9/11 terrorist attack.

As I mentioned in my previous article, Comey also gave Bill Clinton a pass with his pardon of Marc Rich and others. Then came his pass on Hillary and her email debacle, where she set up a private email server for herself, her family and Abedin which was not accessible by the federal government or congress, and on which classified documents were passed.

Hillary Clinton violated the Espionage Act of 1913 by allowing national defense information to be “lost, stolen, abstracted, or destroyed” through “gross negligence.” And get this, Comey had Hillary Clinton’s definitive backup email device during the entire charade of an investigation into the former Secretary of State, according to court records obtained by Judicial Watch.

Godfather of Comey’s Daughter is Pence Lawyer

Here is a timeline of Comey’s career, note that he worked for McGuire Woods law firm from 1993-1996. VP Pence’s office confirmed that he retained Richard Cullen, chairman of McGuire Woods LLP, to assist him in responding to inquiries by special counsel Robert Mueller. Cullen and Comey used to work together at McGuire Woods, and Richard Cullen is the Godfather to one of Comey’s daughters. Too close for comfort if you ask me.

Comey / Mueller Buddy-Buddy Connections

The fact that Robert Mueller, the former FBI head who “bungled” the post-9/11 anthrax attack, is leading the “Russia-gate” investigation should be a matter of grave concern for Americans. Mueller’s appointment to investigate our President for sacking Comey is a conflict of interest, especially since they have worked closely together in the past.

“Former Director Mueller is exactly the right kind of individual for this job. I now have significantly greater confidence that the investigation will follow the facts wherever they lead.” Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) stated. Schumer, Dick Durbin and other Democrats echoed these comments, along with neo-cons John McCain and Paul Ryan, which should worry constitutional conservatives.

Plamegate

Remember in 2003, Valerie Plame’s name being inadvertently leaked by Richard Armitage who confessed to his boss, Colin Powell? This was a scheme against Vice President Cheney that ended in the conviction of his aide, Scooter Libby, for a weakly proven process crime. Tag team Comey was the special prosecutor and Mueller was FBI Director. They may well have honed their Deep State purge of political opponents then, something clearly at the bottom of this investigation into fictional “Russian collusion” and now “Obstruction of Justice” with the Trump campaign. [ Link]

Amerithrax

Comey is a very close friend of Mueller, and covered for the erstwhile director in the Amerithrax affair and the upcoming inquiry could very well be a quid pro quo transaction.

Mueller thought he had his man in the bungled Anthrax investigation because two drug sniffing doggies liked scientist Steven Hatfill when he petted them. Mueller used this flimsy proof on this conservative government scientist, when in fact, the FBI ignored a 2002 tip from a scientific colleague of the alleged anthrax killer, who turned out to be a Fort Detrick scientist named Bruce Edwards Ivins. There was no firm proof he was responsible either, and he ended up committing suicide. Comey seconded Mueller’s opinion, and they were both wrong.

Also check out Comey and Mueller’s showdown at John Ashcroft’s hospital bed. Link

And don’t forget Mueller’s purposely botched probe and coverup of the BCCI scandal.

Mueller and Islam

Robert Mueller purged FBI training documents after 9/11. As reported by Rick Wells, FBI Assistant Director James Kallstrom spoke to Maria Bartiromo. The topic of the interview shifted to the issue of the real collusion, that of the Muslim Brotherhood and CAIR taking a prominent role and infiltrating the FBI. He described how the White House, under both George W. Bush and the Obama regime and the FBI, including specifically Robert Mueller, changed to accommodate the demands of the terrorist front organization after the Twin Towers came down. Mueller acquiesced with Muslim Brotherhood front group, CAIR.

He also met with Nihad Awad, executive director of Hamas doing business as CAIR, as well as senior leadership of the Islamic Institute, the American Muslim Council and the Muslim Public Affairs Council (all Muslim Brotherhood affiliates) in 2002 at FBI headquarters.

In 2005, under Mueller’s administration, the FBI presented an award to Mohamed Magid, the imam of the infamous ADAMS center – a hardline Wahhabis mosque – and the president of ISNA.

There have been several other instances of Mueller’s Muslim Brotherhood collusion and investigative “incompetence.”

In 2013, Mueller testified that he was unaware that the mosque attended by the Tsarnaev brothers, the perpetrators of the Boston Marathon bombing that resulted in three deaths and close to 300 injuries, was founded by Al Qaeda financier Abdurahman Alamoudi. Incredibly, Mueller’s department had been conducting “outreach” activities with the facility’s imam at the time.

Gohmert Exposed Mueller as Terrorist Facilitator

Rep. Louis Gohmert, (R-TX) knows what Robert Mueller is, and does not share the fawning reverence for him as the DC swamp creatures do. Mueller, has a long record of being an official cover man for jihadists choosing to operate in the United States. Remember the fact that Mueller purged all of the FBI training materials and other records which indicated reference to Islamic terrorism in the months following the 9/11 attacks, but then he also ignored warnings about the Tsarnaev brothers and never even attempted to investigate their mosque.

Judicial Watch exclusively obtained droves of records back in 2013 documenting how, under Mueller’s leadership, the FBI purged all anti-terrorism training material deemed “offensive” to Muslims after secret meetings between Islamic organizations and the FBI chief. Judicial Watch had to sue to get the records and published an in-depth report on the scandal in 2013 and a lengthier, updated follow-up in 2015. Read the full report.

When Gohmert questioned Mueller two months after the Boston bombing, he forced admissions from him of his failures or complicity in creating the situation in which the terrorist attacks occurred. Here’s the full story.

Watch the video:

Many Uncomfortable with Mueller

Why should we be uncomfortable with Mueller? 1) The leftist establishment is comfortable with him. 2) He worked in tandem with Comey on a couple of high profile cases. 3) He was chosen as FBI head by George W. Bush (hater of Trump and owner of the words “That was some weird shit,” in describing Trump’s Inauguration speech. 4) Obama felt so comfortable with Mueller that upon taking office he extended Mueller’s ten-year tenure an additional two years.

Not exactly a resume I feel comfortable in handing our president’s fate over to.

Conclusion

One way to counter the Mueller probe is to discredit Mueller, using the facts about his terrible treatment of a series of American scientists in the anthrax case. In the end, the FBI paid off one scientist, to the tune of millions of dollars in damages, and drove another to his death. Meanwhile, the al-Qaeda operatives who carried out the attacks got away. That Mueller could survive this debacle with a sterling reputation is evidence of the corruption in the Washington, D.C. swamp.

Next up, Mueller hires 13 lawyers for this phony Russian probe and plans to hire more.

As this week’s spy drama continues to unfold, a former military intelligence officer and police detective told NewsWithViews.com that last year President Barack Obama’s Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, signed off on — and expedited — two FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) Court requests to wiretap the Trump campaign.

Former homicide detective Barry Thomas Neallon, a retired intelligence operative with the U.S. Marines (*Force Recon), claims, “If Attorney General Lynch was processing applications for electronic eavesdropping warrants, then both her boss, Barack Obama, and her FBI chief, James Comey, had to know about the spying and the justification to invade the privacy of a presidential candidate from the opposition party.”

Besides Neallon’s statement to NewsWithViews.com, ABC News reported on Thursday that all of the applications to the FISA Court were authorized by Lynch.

“[Which] means that she chose not to investigate the Clinton Foundation for illegal activities but rather signed an application to wiretap President Trump,” stated Jim Hoft, the editor-in-chief for the Gateway Pundit website.

Just about every news story on the subject of the Trump wiretaps mentions that the FISA Court turned down the first request to wiretap Trump even though it was requested by Lynch herself. The fact the FISA judge nixed the warrant is evidence that the Justice Department did not even come close to satisfying the usually minimal standards for obtaining such warrants.

Out of close to 11,000 warrant applications during the Obama administration only two were rejected by the FISA Court. “It’s almost like getting an indictment from a grand jury. A decent prosecutor could get a ham sandwich indicted. Likewise, judges aren’t tough on warrants unless they believe the requester is on a ‘fishing expedition’ or the request is totally without merit,” said former police officer and corporate security director Iris Aquino.

When on Saturday morning President Trump’s tweeted that President Barack Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower in October 2016, the usual cabal of Democrats and news media outlets began their routine of casting doubts on Trump’s accusation. “It was as if they were saying ‘how dare you make outrageous allegations against Saint Barack,'” Aquino noted in a tongue-in-cheek quip.

Meanwhile, Ben Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser for Obama, told the news media over and over again that presidents can’t order a wiretap. He also cast doubts on the honesty of the new president.

Lynch made statements this week on a video and she’s heard encouraging protests and marches, blood in the streets and even death in order to stop and topple the Trump administration.

During the last presidential election cycle, a man named Julian Assange single-handedly alerted a large number of American voters about the secretive, devious and hypocritical goings-on at the Democratic National Committee headquarters and their connections to the Hillary Clinton for President campaign and members of the so-called mainstream news media. The damage done to the Democratic Party as a result of the leaked information may never be fully gauged.

Instead of looking at cyber security considerations at the DNC — a political party that’s not part of the U.S. government — Democrats in both houses of Congress prefer to make wildly absurd accusations about President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and anyone else they can drudge up in order to portray themselves as victims. Also, instead of asking the appropriate committees in the House and Senate to probe the nation’s vulnerability to foreign espionage — especially cyber espionage — the Democrats wish to create an ad hoc or select committee to investigate the alleged cyber crimes perpetrated against their opposition.

The Josephine County Republican Party Precinct Committee Person’s (PCP) voted against all three taxing levies unanimously. The current ballot levies lack transparency and accountability that is demanded by Josephine County tax payers. While the PCPs support the Sheriff Department and Public Safety, but the .93 cent per $1,000 dollar assessed value did not offer any financial breakdown on how the funds would be spent.

Providing a financial breakdown accomplishes two things; 1) It shows the tax payer they have actually looked at the numbers and are truly requesting what is needed and 2) it provides for accountability if the funds are not spent the way it has been represented to the tax payer. An example of this is the last public safety tax levy. We were told the deputies were driving old, unsafe vehicles and the levy was desperately needed to replace the aging vehicles. It failed, yet 3 brand new SUV’s and Crew Cab Pick-up Truck have appeared with new branding and paint jobs.

Now the Sheriff is painting the old patrol vehicle he claimed were dangerous with the new paint scheme. The Sheriff is requesting another levy, yet is painting patrol vehicles. How does that work in the priority of efficiently using tax payer dollars. I guess it is more important to look good than provide patrol.

The reason that there in no accountability of how the tax money is spend is simple. The Commissioners spending record is always the same. Whenever they run into money, it always burns a hole in their political pocket. The first thing they do is give raises, higher benefits and cost of living increases to government cronies earning between $75,000.00 and $150,000.00 per year.

The cost of living increases, food, fuel, utilities, rent, yet those in our community that are living on fixed incomes don’t receive inflationary or cost of living adjustments to their income and have to make it stretch further than they did last year. It is unethical to ask them for more when they are just barely getting by.

We have watched the recent budget hearings where the Josephine County Commissioners prioritize funding. Was Sheriff Department & Public Safety the first item funded? No it was the last. Josephine County charges the Sheriff Department $617,000.00 in maintenance, a 30% increase, yet the Sheriff Department does not have 30% more buildings. The $617,000.00 is in addition to utilities paid by the Sheriff Department. Once again the Josephine Board of County Commissioners Lilly Morgan, Dan DeYoung and Simon Hare have budgeted punitively, not addressing the wishes of the citizens.

Governments only purpose is the protection of the citizens, yet they fund fee collecting departments before the Sheriff. Once again our newly elected County Commissioners Lilly Morgan and Dan DeYoung have failed those they represent.

The 3 Proposed Property Tax Measures

1- Property Tax Measure For Animal Control, Measure: 17:77

The Josephine County dog catcher wants more of your money, so the commissioners decided to put it on the ballot again. Last election we gave them .08 cents to improve the Animal Shelter, and they did. Now they want another .08 cents, for what? It would be reasonable to ask for .04 – 05 cents to maintain the improvements they made to the Animal Shelter, but they continue to grow unnecessary government.

2- Property Tax Measure For The Library, Measure: 17:79

The library should be staffed with volunteers and the money to fund the library should come from user fees not peoples property. In today’s world of the internet the library’s are seldom used because everything one needs to know can be Googled and found on the internet. Library’s throughout the country are used less and less.

3- Property Tax Measure for the Sheriff, Measure: 17:80

It is true, the Sheriff could use more money to hire more deputies. It is also true the sheriff can’t guarantee your safety no matter how many deputy’s he has or how much money you give him. Public is told by the commissioners that crime is rampant in the county and that if the levy’s fails we are all going to be doomed.

A Recent Study Reported by KAJO [Read the study]



“National Council Ranks Grants Pass as One of the Safest Cities in State of Oregon Grants Pass is among six cities in Southern Oregon that are listed by a national council as the safest in the state.

The City of Grants Pass is joined by Ashland, Central Point, Eagle Point, Klamath Falls and Brookings in the list of Top 40 Safest Cities in Oregon.

The National Council for Home Safety and Security came up with the rankings by combining FBI criminal data, its own population data and internal research….”

The truth is, what the 2 new city councilors Morgan and DeYoung want to accomplish is to bring the county property taxes up to the city level. Which means your county property taxes would double.

Conclusion

First: If the 3 county property tax levy’s pass, approximately 33% on the revenue raised would go to fund the government worker’s retirement pension aka PERS.

Second: The first thing the commissioners would do is the same thing they always do, give cost of living increases (raises) to county bureaucrats.

Third: Hire more code enforcers in black uniform to come on your property looking for any code violations. Code violation tickets are a BIG revenue maker for the City of Grants Pass. Code enforcers earn approximately $100.000.00 plus per year and brings in lots of money from the people who can’t afford it.

Four: Lesson learned. The more of your money the government has, the less freedom you’ll have. In other words, by giving the unaccountable bureaucrats more of your hard earned money without accountability, you are in essence funding your own destruction.

Five: Lilly Morgan a lifelong Democrat recently switched and became a Republican. A former City Of Grants Pass Councillor, Lilly is also a parole officer on PERS. She was heavily supported by Liberal Pastor Jim Brumbach that also gave us liberal Commissioner Simon Hare.

The solution

Elect principled public servants that look out for the people instead of themselves and the cronies running the unaccountable government. Government IS a necessary evil that must be watched constantly.

By NWV Senior Political News Writer, Jim Kouri

Under President Trump’s predecessors, leaks of national security information were relatively rare, even with America’s vibrant free press. Under President Trump, leaks are flowing at the rate of one a day, an examination of open-source material by the majority staff of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs shows.

Articles published by a range of national news organizations between January 20 and May 25, 2017 included at least 125 stories with leaked information potentially damaging to national security. Even a narrow search revealed leaks of comparable information during the Trump administration that were about seven times higher than the same period during the two previous administrations.

From the morning of President Trump’s inauguration, when major newspapers published information about highly sensitive intelligence intercepts, news organizations have reported on an avalanche of leaks from officials across the U.S. government. Many disclosures have concerned the investigations of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election, with the world learning details of whose communications U.S. intelligence agencies are monitoring, what channels are being monitored, and the results of those intercepts. All such revelations are potential violations of federal law, punishable by jail time.

But the leak frenzy has gone far beyond the Kremlin and has extended to other sensitive information that could harm national security. President Trump’s private conversations with other foreign leaders have shown up in the press, while secret operations targeting America’s most deadly adversaries were exposed in detail.

As the New York Times wrote in a candid self-assessment: “Journalism in the Trump era has featured a staggering number of leaks from sources across the federal government.” No less an authority than President Obama’s CIA director called the deluge of state secrets “appalling.”

These leaks do not occur in a vacuum. They can, and do, have real world consequences for national security. To ensure the security of our country’s most sensitive information, federal law enforcement officials ought to thoroughly investigate leaks of potentially sensitive information flowing at an alarming rate.

Under the direction of Senator Ron Johnson, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, majority committee staff examined media leaks between January 20, 2017, and May 25, 2017—President Trump’s first 126 days in office. The examination consisted entirely of publicly available news articles; no classified information was accessed or reviewed. The inquiry found:

The Trump administration faced 125 leaked stories—one leak a day— containing information that is potentially damaging to national security under the standards laid out in a 2009 Executive Order signed by President Barack Obama. Leaks with the capacity to damage national security flowed about seven times faster under President Trump than during President Obama’s and President George W. Bush’s first 126 days. Most leaks during the Trump administration, 78, concerned the Russia probes, with many revealing closely-held information such as intelligence community intercepts, FBI interviews and intelligence, grand jury subpoenas, and even the workings of a secret surveillance court. Other leaks disclosed potentially sensitive intelligence on U.S. adversaries for possible military plans against them. One leak, about the investigation of a terrorist attack, caused a diplomatic incident between the United States and a close ally.

Leaked stories appeared in 18 news outlets, sourced to virtually every possible permutation of anonymous current and former U.S. officials, some clearly from the intelligence community. One story cited more than two dozen anonymous sources.

Almost all of the stories leaked during President Trump’s first 126 days were about the President or his administration. In contrast, only half of the stories leaked during the comparable period of the Obama administration were about President Obama or his administration; the other half concerned President Bush and his anti-terrorism tactics.

Many watchdog-group reports and news stories have revealed the serious deficiencies that exist are blamed on Obama’s CIA director John Brennan for allowing what was supposed to be a non-political bureaucracy into a politically-motivated subsidiary of the Democratic National Committee.

While the investigation of alleged collusion between the Trump for President campaign and operatives working for Russia’s President Vladimir Putin does not appear to be bearing fruit, it does prove how easily computer hackers have exposed classified intelligence from the once premiere spy network.

In fact, according to a number of reports coming from watchdogs such as Judicial Watch, the Clarion Project, Larry Klayman’s Freedom Watch, and others, the CIA and FBI have conceded that it may have been insiders illegally divulging classified information and that the CIA is currently searching for the traitorous leakers.

In addition, the former Director of Central Intelligence, John Brennan, allegedly worked feverishly to undermine Donald Trump’s presidential campaign by leaking intelligence obtained from Great Britain and European Union countries. It’s already been revealed that a British top-secret signal-intelligence agency sent reports to Obama or his minions who then leaked them to the world’s news media.

“During former FBI Director James Comey’s testimony in front of the Senate, he actually admitted he leaked information. In fact, the coward didn’t have the b*lls to do it himself — he had a professor-friend leak the info,” according to former attorney and political consultant Theo Doreapoulos.

According to Trump insider, Roger Stone, “[T]he standard operating procedure for the intelligence agencies is that they go to a third-party nation and they ask them to conduct the surveillance so that the CIA can play dumb. So, they have not violated the law, technically. Judge Napolitano turns out to be absolutely right and I think folks at FOX management, owe him an apology. I want to learn more about this because I still think we are going to learn that the ‘deep state,’ the 17 intelligence agencies, have promulgated this myth of Russian collusion because it is the rationale they used to surveil Donald Trump and his aides. And that would mean that there is no Russian collusion proven, and their motive was solely political. That’s Watergate times 10.”



“While opponents of President Trump have become emboldened in the wake of General Flynn’s resignation as the National Security Adviser, and while the media has reveled in a frenzy of self-righteous outrage that conceals its glee, it is important to observe that his resignation was sparked by leaked information coming from unelected bureaucrats within our nation’s intelligence apparatus, seemingly provoked by their deep distaste for the new administration. Even more ominously, some of these bureaucrats are perhaps motivated by their loyalties to the Obama administration,” said Jay Sekulow, a public-interest attorney who often argues cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.

Sekulow also said, “Someone in the Obama Administration unmasked the names of those on the Trump transition team who were caught up in that surveillance. That someone was discovered to be Susan Rice who served Obama as the national security adviser and gained a reputation as a dishonest political hack and liar.”

“Now we know this goes far beyond incidental surveillance. This was spying on political enemies,” he added.

“Mr. Brennan is, at best, willfully blind to the threat posed to homeland and national security of the United States by those who adhere to Shariah law,” said Tom Trento, executive director of the Florida Security Council, who has been critical of Brennan’s service in the Obama White House.

Some of the nation’s top intelligence, military, national security and law enforcement experts once loudly called for Homeland Security Advisor John Brennan to resign from his post or for President Barack Obama to fire Brennan from his White House staff.

By Paul Cappadona Author of Taking Back America the Party’s Over

The Fourth Estate

The Bill of Rights, Article I states, “Congress shall make no law… abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press;” What can we do if an enemy sets up a “press” to manipulate elections, news, and other information to promote its ends or to subvert our way of life? Shouldn’t that be considered treason or sedition? Whenever the “press” or other media over-steps the bounds of their job which is to bring news, information, and entertainment to the public, it becomes an un-elected power instead of a service. Whenever the press wields un-elected power, it is called the “Fourth Estate”.

Wherever power can be derived, you will find power perverts who are those that lust God like power. Just like their degenerate counterparts, molesters, or thieves, they gravitate to areas of accessibility for their wicked “needs”. The power perverts and their want-to-be power puppets of the media have little regard for bringing honest information and entertainment to the public. They will use or sell their position for the pleasures of power. In this power grab, they work the news to fit what they want us to believe. With the selected information, they transmit, they more than make a departure from their honest function. They use deceptive, descriptive words, they will give or withhold publicity to people of their choosing. They will give their approval or disapproval of actions. The “spin” they give to the news is only to influence us and shape a system suited for their master’s pleasure. Thereby they shape events at every level of life into their ideal image. It appears that their conduct and language are directed against the public order and the tranquility of state. This constant ridicule and stirring up of disorder of the very country in which they live, is the meaning of sedition. Not only is there enough evidence of sedition to bring formal accusation, but there could also be a good case for conspiracy and treason. In a message presented to Congress in 1917, Congressman Oscar Callaway stated, “In March 1915, the J.P. Morgan interests…and their subsidiary organizations…got together 12 men high up in the newspaper world and employed them to select the most influential newspapers in the United States and sufficient number of them to control generally the policy of the daily press…They found it was only necessary to purchase the control of twenty-five of the greatest papers. An agreement was reached; the policy of the papers was bought, to be paid for by the month; an editor was furnished for each paper to properly supervise and edit information regarding the questions of preparedness, militarism, financial policies, and other things of national and international nature considered vital to the interests of the purchasers.” In regards to the media of his day, Abraham Lincoln said, “He who molds the public sentiment… makes statues and decisions possible or impossible to make.”

To show the danger of the undisciplined Fourth Estate and the treason that can result, here is what David Rockefeller, founder of the Trilateral Commission said in an address before the media power brokers in June of 1991… “We are grateful to The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine, and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years. But, the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto determination practiced in the past centuries.” Auto determination is single determination, such as a government with a Constitution. It is a sovereign Nation, autonomous, having of itself the power of determination.

Freedom of an honest press is a problem for any government, as it should be. The Bill of Rights tell us that Congress shall make no law, but if we read down a little further we find how to discipline the Fourth Estate. Article V states, “No person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury…” Article VI. States, “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury…” We, the private citizens of these United States, are the Grand Juries and Trial Juries. We can indict and if warranted, convict any law breakers, including the media’s seditious abuse as the Fourth Estate. Remember, “The most important political office is that of the private citizen.” If we shirk our responsibilities in preserving our freedoms, they will be lost. Congress has the power to declare the punishment of treason. Treason is not only levying war against the United States but also giving the enemies of freedom aid and/or comfort.

In the Constitution for the United States in sections 3 through 7, we find this same principal. “Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but….” (Emphasis mine) If we do not read the Constitution for ourselves, the media and our corrupt politicians stop right there just before “but” and this is where it will usually end. However, if we just read on a little further past the “but”, it is made very clear that we must not stop there. The word but, means added to, not to be left out, part of the above. Here is the rest. “…but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial, and punishment, according to law.” Who indicts? Who convicts? We do! We do! The Grand Jury indicts, and the Petit Jury convicts! Not only can we take care of the treasons committed by the Fourth Estate but we can take care of the loose ends in all branches of our government, both State and Federal. The best way to help is take back the people’s branch of government, the Judicial Branch by book casing it with real grand juries to indict and real petit juries to find guilt or innocence.

Former New York news editor, John Swinton, said, “We are tools and vassals of the rich behind the scenes. We are marionettes … intellectual prostitutes.” Wow, is that a repentant journalist? Maybe there is hope. Until we educate our jury system we should take advice from a man that had a lot of trouble from the Fourth Estate and continues to have these past two hundred years, even in death. Thomas Jefferson said, “Those who never read a newspaper are better off than those who do, for it is better to be uninformed then misinformed.”

363,https://newswithviews.com/six-reasons-why-the-christian-retail-industry-is-struggling/,newswithviews,Six Reasons Why The Christian Retail Industry Is Struggling,[],"Six Reasons Why The Christian Retail Industry Is Struggling

1.) A lot of consumers don’t understand the importance of support for local establishments. Some people think it’s “cool” to shop online without realizing that every purchase is the equivalent of a vote. When people shop online, they are voting for their local shopping options to vanish and to send their prosperity away from their communities.

2.) Some vendors circumvented “brick and mortar” by going direct to the end consumer instead of using locally established outlets. It is impossible to stay in any business when the same folks who make a product are enticing consumers to shop direct with them and using financial incentives as a lure. Fly-by-night internet opportunists and volunteer-staffed church bookstores eliminated jobs by competing with local businesses.

When we joined the Christian Booksellers Association in 1988, we were required to have a location open to the public at least 40 hours a week in a downtown or retail area. Most companies we bought from required us to be a legitimate business with standard operating expenses. The direct-to-consumer sales diminished the demand that drove customers into our stores for products and services. Filling the needs of the community made it possible for local bookstores to pay rent, utilities, wages and taxes. Distribution is one thing, but undercutting and shutting out local businesses to support mega-operations in a distant location destroys the community spirit as well as the local economy.

3.) Message erosion—lack of trust in the integrity of the message. Is it worth buying if it may not be good? Our store has always tried to stock the best values and faithful messages, but the spiritual junk food is giving folks cavities.

4.) An abundance of information everywhere. Many consumers now expect everything to be either cheap or free. Instead of enjoying the Bible, they would rather spend an abbreviated amount of time on Google or YouTube.

5.) Younger shoppers, from middle age down, are adopting online shopping as a way of life. I’ll never forget the hurt I felt when I realized my churches were shopping online. When people support Amazon, they’re also supporting the distribution of pornography, violent video games and all other forms of anti-Christian godlessness. Christian consumers are spending their hard-earned money to make Amazon prosper, to the destruction of their fellow Christians’ businesses.

6.) Publishers implemented uneven scales by giving better terms and discounts to the “big box” retailers. There was no voice to demand the same deals for the independents. The FCS chain was considered “too big to fail”, so their creditors let them have the longest leash in the industry and they failed anyway. It’s as if the independent local retailers were invisible.

So what can we learn about this?

Honor God. How we live our lives, treat our vendors and our customers and everyone in our communities reflects our belief system. If God is not first, nothing else matters.

Debt is bad. Spending money you don’t have and failing to pay your obligations is not wise. I have a hard time calling it “Family Christian Stores” because it’s not owned by a family and it’s not Christian to not pay your debts. The only part of the name that is accurate is “Stores”. When it went bankrupt two years ago, a judge expunged $127 million dollars of debt owed to their vendors. Considering there were about 266 stores at the time, that’s around $612,100 in debt per store! The chain was bought in 2012 and organized as a non-profit organization with the benefit of more tax advantages. This makes it more difficult to understand how the debt could have gotten so far out of control. (Their records show they had gross sales of $230 million—averaging nearly $900,000 annual sales per store. So the amount of debt would have been more than six months of gross sales!)

Charity: If you want to donate to a charity, donate out of your own bank account. If you buy because you thought the business was donating to charity, it is a marketing manipulation. FCS advertised they gave their profits to missions projects and widows and orphans. That sounds noble enough, but cheating a company out of payments due so you can donate to a good cause is not right or honorable. By other calculations, the amount donated was .01% of gross sales. That means if you spent $100.00, about one penny was donated to charity!

Fairness: Buy something for what it is worth and sell something for what it is worth. I have had customers come into my bookstore asking for special discounts. For one person to get a discount means others must pay more to make up for it. This results in a “thumb-on-the-scales” effect. We don’t get discounts off our electric bills or tax bills, so it’s better for everyone to charge a fair price for everything and then everybody benefits.

In the statement to their customers, Family Christian Stores blamed the publishers and gift vendors for not giving them big enough discounts and more time to pay “so they could remain competitive.” Competitive against what? FCS located their stores in market areas that were already served and fought against independent Christian bookstores by undercutting the pricing integrity.

As long as the publishers cooperated with their strategy, our industry was doomed. The publishers could take a lesson from Lifeway Publishers. If you have a good book, you don’t have to degrade the suggested retail price to get people to buy it.

It’s been said that competing on price is the worst strategy because you lose even if you win. This chain ate others in the industry and ultimately ate themselves. Selling for the cheapest price is not a ministry. Competition in our industry is not just harmless “fun and games”.

We didn’t realize how badly we were being oppressed until FCS went away. The upper-level management of FCS did a great deal of damage to the Christian retail industry. We were so mercilessly undersold, we shouldn’t have continued to exist this long. FCS tried to break the backs of the local independent Christian bookstores by competing in these ways:

1.) They opened up in areas served by other Christian bookstores.

2.) They created a mentality in our customers to always wait for a coupon.

3.) They trained customers that everything should be on a $5 sale.

4.) They created a false perception that purchasing from them is the same as donating to charity.

5.) Many Christian bookstores were so demoralized, they lost the desire to compete because the marketing conditions were stacked against them.

6.) This aggressive behavior caused the demise of hundreds of local independent Christian bookstores.

Is there a future for our industry? That depends on whether the Christians want us enough to support us. The marketplace is defined and shaped by the need. Everyone seems to love the ministry aspect of our position, but even ministries must have a financial foundation in order to continue. It is up to the customers to decide how to support a brick and mortar presence in their communities.

People frequently come into our store looking for donations for their charitable events. If they shop on Amazon, why are they not asking Amazon to donate to their events? A business in the marketplace is part of the community. A relationship can only work if it is mutually beneficial. The customers in a community where a Christian bookstore exists will write the rest of the story.

On June 30, 2017, in Lexington, Kentucky, Sam Girod, an Amish farmer, was sentenced to 72 months in prison. Girod’s crime? According to the federal agents going after him, he made a salve without the FDA’s permission. That’s it! A salve so innocuous that you could make it in your own kitchen. This “felonious” salve consists of rosemary, beeswax, olive oil, peppermint, eucalyptus, and chickweed.

He’s now in prison about 7 hours away from his family — his wife Elizabeth, their 12 children and 25 grandchildren — although Sam has never harmed anyone. There are no victims of the 3 herbal salves he made and sold for over 20 years.

In 2012, someone called the FDA and reported that a store in MO was selling Sam’s products and that medical claims were being made.

The claims turned out to be customer testimonials contained in a brochure about Sam’s products. No different than Amazon reviews, yet, since Sam reprinted his customer testimonials in a brochure, the FDA calls these “medical claims,” which puts Sam’s products under their so-called “jurisdiction”. Sam complied and stopped producing any further brochures.

Then the FDA claimed to have found a MO customer who had been harmed by Sam’s bloodroot salve, which turned out to be false – he wasn’t using Sam’s product.

With so many so-called “illicit” infractions the FDA decided to take Sam to federal court in MO in 2013.

The Amish do not use lawyers as a rule and Sam did not. Because he barely presented a defense against federal prosecutors, Sam was convicted on all counts against him.

To quote our friend, Sheriff Richard Mack, founder of CSPOA.org:

“The FDA and several state agencies as well, have already been raiding the Amish who think they can own a few acres of land, grow grass on it, let their cows graze and digest the grass, bring the cows home in the evenings, and milk them. Then the Amish have the criminal audacity to make raw dairy products and share them with family and neighbors. Many such dairies have been destroyed by our brave public officials and many Amish have been arrested. SWAT teams have raided such ‘criminal enterprises’ to protect us all from such dangerous people!”

Thanks to constitutional sheriffs or courts with juries who know their real duty, some Americans have been protected from this lawless tyranny.

You see, there is no authority for the FDA found in the constitution. The constitution designates no authority for a Federal Drug and Food Administration.

The FDA has found pretended authority, which they claim appears in the general welfare clause. However, the general welfare clause only applies to the 17 items found in Article 1, Section 8. This is a perfect example of what our founders call “pretended legislation” in the Declaration of Independence. This is a dangerous make-believe. The solution would be for a representative who understands the constitution to call for the impeachment of this federal judge, and finally, the president should pardon Sam so he can return home and be with his family.

You see God is the only one that can give rights. Not the FDA. And the right to health? Well, that’s yours and mine.

By NWV Senior Political News Writer, Jim Kouri

A group of pro-life activists will hold a demonstration and press conference in front of the Russell Senate Office Building as well as a prayer vigil at the office of GOP Sen. Mitch McConnell, the current Senate Majority Leader.

According to the anti-abortion group Created Equal, Baby Hope will be delivered to Sen. Mitch McConnell containing a 12-week fetal model with a message to defund Planned Parenthood from Baby Hope. In the coming days, 100 US Senators will receive important packages.

The deliveries won’t be simple notes from their constituents. Within days, every single US Senator will be delivered Baby Hope, a twelve-week old baby, with a personal message from her to defund Planned Parenthood and redirect the hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to community health centers instead of paying for the baby execution arm of the Democratic Party.

The activists — the majority of whom are Christians, Jews and even Muslims will be urging the Senate to stop subsidizing abortion and redirect abortion giant Planned Parenthood’s taxpayer funding. “It’s all a scam. The Democrats push for tax money in the millions to be donated to Planned Parenthood each year. Then Planned Parenthood turns around and donates those taxpayer dollars to Democratic Party candidates especially presidential and congressional candidates.

“Participants will stand in solidarity with the 329,000 innocent children that are aborted every year at Planned Parenthood abortion clinics across the nation,” noted Mark Harrington, National Director of Created Equal said.

Besides Created Equal, the large-scale Christian Defense Coalition will take part in this latest reminder to the U.S. Senators who said during election time they supported Presidential candidate Donald Trump’s promise to defund America’s abortion giant, Planned Parenthood.

“Funding for Planned Parenthood has been a perennial issue since Republicans won control of the House in 2010, and each time, Republican leaders have finessed it by saying the matter would be settled in a broader health care bill. Now, is the time to hold these pro-life representatives accountable for their campaign promises. We will deliver a strong message to every single US Senator to defund Planned Parenthood and end all funding streams for abortion in the health care bill,” said Harrington.

Abortion is not healthcare and not one penny of taxpayer funding should go to an organization that takes the lives of 329,000 innocent children every year. We encourage the Senate to follow the lead of their colleagues in the House and not include the funding of Planned Parenthood in their healthcare legislation.

EXPOSING PLANNED PARENTHOOD’S ABORTION AND MUTILATION ACTIVITIES

David Daleiden and the Center for Medical Progress (CMP) released a video recently showing Planned Parenthood’s willingness to engage in the illegal sale of fetal body parts. In the video, President of the Medical Directors’ Council for PP Federation of America’s Dr. Mary Gatter says that $50 per aborted baby is “on the low end” of payment for fetal specimens. Gatter was shown in a previous CMP video discussing the sale of babies aborted at PP facilities, saying, “I want a Lamborghini.”

In the latest video, Gatter says she wants the price to cover the cost of a technician who will harvest the fetal parts, including livers and lungs. Federal law prohibits the sale of fetal tissue for profit.

“Once again, David Daleiden has shed light on criminal activity at the highest levels of Planned Parenthood’s leadership,” stated Alexandra Snyder, Executive Director for the Life Legal Defense Foundation.

“We look forward to the results of pending criminal investigations of a number of Planned Parenthood affiliates by the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI. Life Legal continues to press for the withdrawal of all federal funds from an organization that routinely exhibits a callous disregard for human life and that flaunts its willingness to violate the law.”

Life Legal represents Daleiden in two civil lawsuits filed against him by the National Abortion Federation and by Planned Parenthood Federation of America, along with numerous Planned Parenthood affiliates.

Meanwhile, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s niece Alveda King, who has been ignored by big media because she supported — and campaigned for — President Donald Trump, recently said, “The Supreme Court, Social Security, Failing Public Schools, tax issues, voter registration problems, and women’s health crisis have been connected to liberal abortion policies.”

In her new book America Return To God, Evangelist King encourages America to pray for our President, all leaders and those in authority and for everyone on earth. Her message to the man in the Oval Office. “Yes, Drain the Swamp President Trump! Defund Planned Parenthood.”

My Response to Pastor Chuck Baldwin [Link]

I have had the good fortune to see my articles in NewsWithViews.com over the years. I say this because being one of the “deplorables” in America today limits our access to many journalistic opportunities, and yet like many of the faithful of publisher Paul Walter, we wouldn’t have it any other way.

As such, many of you who’ve been following Pastor Chuck Baldwin’s philosophical meanderings through the years might have caught a slight dissonance in his recent column, “Is Netanyahu Finished”, as if something was out of sync.

I am using this opportunity to rebut his points, one by one. I look forward to your heartfelt responses to my article. Let me say from the outset: this is a no-holds-barred rebuttal to his opining of Netanyahu, Israel, Jews, and Christians. We all know that if you want to get people riled up, just talk about Israel, Jews, and Christian attitudes to the above and you’ll open the Pandora’s Box.

PB (Pastor Baldwin): “Bibi is one of the most corrupt political leaders on the planet”

RS (Rabbi Shifren): Perhaps it is so, but being in the middle east, surrounded by those who want your demise, is not an easy situation for any leader. Here is a country where literally nothing is normal (I may seem to be leaning here toward Pastor Baldwin, but for different reasons). Fully 50% doesn’t want to, or rebels at, anything resembling traditional Judaism. You have an active, aggressive Gay/Lesbian population eating away at the thousands of years of Biblical prophecy and Divine intervention. And you also have open communists with an axe to grind in the spirit of Marx, Trotsky, and Alinsky.

Then there are Hellenists, who if they had no Israeli passport, would resemble anybody windsurfing at Waikiki or eating sushi in Beverly Hills, and Yeshiva students who never see the light of the sun, squinting at obtuse tractates of Talmudic law under the cover of dimly lit florescent bulbs. Last but not least, there is an active, healthy underground fueled by pimps, prostitutes, and a mafia which would make Meir Lansky blush. So yes, Pastor Baldwin is right about the insanity of Israel….but to be its LEADER, well now, that takes an acute level of ability that the Democratic Party of Waters, Ellison, and Pelosi could hardly dream of.

And he’s right: Bibi is the darling of many Christian groups who want their own fantasy relationship with the people of the Book, the progeny of the Holocaust. What many don’t realize is that Bibi was for many years ensconced in Manhattan during his position in the UN, gleaning from the rich and powerful, all eager to get in his good graces, being close to a real Israeli war hero, regardless of issues of character or philosophy.

Bibi cleverly marshalled his well-honed English fluency, good looks and Machiavellian political moxie to ingratiate himself into the “salon” milieu, managing to be everything to everybody seeking to find an excuse for being pro-Jew/Israeli. Bibi is so well spoken that when you hear him, you believe every word he says.

Pastor Baldwin doesn’t illuminate why Bibi is going down, and I tend to think that even hardened Israelis have occasionally had it with his hegemony. But the good pastor doesn’t get: many Israeli politicos are corrupt. It is endemic, just as the 25% of the underground economy who is fleeing the tax man.

How legitimate could one be to sit in a coalition with Palestinian Arabs enumerating their hatred for the Jewish state from the dais of the Knesset (parliament), encouraging and abetting intifadas and blood-letting. Really, this is one aspect that the media has left unturned: the special ability to reconcile with a perpetual terrorist sword drawn against its very survival, giving the pretense that this is true “democracy.” So yes, nobody normal, least of all the coalition factions of orthodox rabbis whiling away the tedious speeches of the Arabs, the Israeli Left, and otherwise crass corrupt philistines, could imagine the horror of governing such a witch’s brew. Truly, Bibi has his hands full just keeping Israel alive and safe.

PB: “He is pressuring Donald Trump to ratchet up a war against Iran” to give cover and deflect from his misdeeds…

RS: Here the good pastor shows a complete lack of understanding of the Israeli mind-set. Note well: Israel doesn’t need America, and is fully capable of neutralizing the Iranian threat. Nonetheless, a joint coalition would certainly be favorable and elevate the raison de guerre of Israel in her continuous war to find favor in the eyes of the Gentiles. Yet when the boom is ultimately lowered, Israel will stand alone, just as it did at Entebbe and the Iraqi nuclear facility. They know it, American insiders know it–everyone but Pastor Baldwin knows it.

PB: “There is one common denominator that links the mainstream media with the so-called conservative media: infatuation with the modern state of Israel” (wonder what he means here by “modern”…would these pundits have preferred the Israel of King David? I rather doubt it…)

RS: I detest knee-jerk thinkers and groups, Jewish or Gentile. I abhor “Black Lives Matter” because I know who these punks are. In the same way, I detest playing the Holocaust card. It’s so easy to do, and who wants to be labeled in the same Jew-baiting ranks with Goebbels, Streicher, Eichmann….the entire Jewish leadership plays this card to a tee. Pathetic and stifling of any discussion. Pat Buchanan and Mel Gibson will tell you volumes about going against the Israeli/Jewish bulwark.

PB: “He is mobilizing accelerated (illegal) settlements on private land owned by Palestinians”

RS: Is this man a pastor, a man of god? What religion is he representing? This is perhaps his most puzzling statement to date. Does Pastor Baldwin believe in God? Which God? Because if it’s the God of the Old Testament, and the God of Heaven and Earth, then there is only ONE God…and that same God stated: “The Land of Israel will be an eternal inheritance to your seed”. “Those that bless you will be blessed, those that curse you will be cursed.” Genesis 12:1-3.

The problem the pastor has is that his rhetoric and ideology have trumped his divine calling. I know of not ONE Christian (who truly is a Christian, devoid of anti-Semitic leanings), who does not stand behind this doctrine and other pronouncements in Exodus, giving the Land of Kanaan (Israel) exclusively to the seed of Abraham (see appropriate passages regarding the banishing of Ishmael and his claims).

Therefore, his mention of Palestinian “rights” is curious, suspiciously incongruent with the foundation of Christian theology. Yet, it is difficult to stand up to the nay-sayers in today’s Christian church. Many a man of integrity and knowledge of scripture has given in to the leftists and Palestinian inciters’ relentless assault against traditional belief (It was none other than Arafat that confided that the “Palestinian” cause was bogus, used only as a means to weaken and destroy Israel).

Of course, there have always been malevolent purveyors of Jew-baiting in the history of Christianity. Yet, when candid, these erudite haters will quote you chapter and verse about the exclusivity of the Abrahamic covenant with God, having zero mention of “Palestinian rights.” So, what then must we conclude from Pastor Baldwin’s strange rhetoric? It doesn’t have to be complicated: somewhere, somehow, a Jew stood before him and obstructed his pathway. This is not unique.

PB: “Neither does it hurt that Trump’s son-in-law is a MAJOR financial backer of the (illegal) settlements”

RS: As Reagan would say, “There you go again!” But hey, somebody needs to come up with the green to finance that which the Israeli government has been doing: putting facts on the ground that will never be erased. If God is real (is he, really good Pastor?), and the scriptures are not fake, then this land is part of the biblical Land of Israel, whether we (our congregations/clerics) approve of it, or not. God gave it to Israel, and a lot more than they have today belonged only to them.

PB: “Billionaire Sheldon Adelson is starting to back away from Bibi”

RS: Here’s a man who understands when he’s throwing good money after bad….

PB: “Many Christians have accused me of heresy” for what I said about Bibi

RS: I won’t. You have accurately described Bibi…it’s just that you haven’t seen the big picture. Or that you just have lost your ability to withstand pressure from apostates within your church, or otherwise leftist/anti-Semitic agitators who you might have been courting or perhaps you are the leader in this courting since in one article you stated that the Jews of Israel are not the Jews of the Bible. Well then, PB, who are they? Because many can trace their ancestry back to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.

PB: “For many professing Christians, the modern state of Israel is every bit as important as Jesus Christ himself and their own personal salvation.

RS: This is probably your only righteous statement. The State of Israel is every bit as important as Jesus Christ because Israel is the Wife of God, and the Church states they are the Bride of Christ. The Abrahamic Covenant is unconditional and includes the land, and God does not lie, and neither does he go back on his promises.

[Editor’s Note: See Bibi Netanyahu and President Trump at a press meeting in DC on 2-15-17]

PB: “Netanyahu is not only a crook, a globalist, and murderer, he is also a Talmudist”

RS: A murderer, really? I wasn’t aware, whom did he murder? Your argument has no feet. Not once in your invective have you called to task the unrelenting war of Arab terror against Jews. You’ve saved your arrows for those evil “Talmudists” like Bibi, who actually teaches a Bible class every week.

But how hysterical are you? Bibi a Talmudist? Even Woody Allen would laugh you off your lectern… Bibi is a politician and puts on a yarmulke when he goes to a Concentration Camp, or a funeral. Do you know his heart? You cannot claim you do.

PB: “If you think the Koran is bad, try reading the Talmud.”

RS: Yes, you’ve finally come to your senses: the Koran is definitely bad! Regarding the Talmud, what about that ever-problematic passage about “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth?” Do you know what that means? Of course not, you know nothing of the Talmud except to cherry-pick problematic statements of which you have no clue. Actually, the passage in question refers to monetary damages due to the aggrieved, and not in removing the plaintiff’s eye. So, there you have it, now you can certainly rest. The remainder is a life’s work and toil about what was given over on Sinai, and what was transmitted orally, known as the Oral Law (as opposed to the Bible, or Written Law). Few have the time, patience, and determination to dive into the minutia and profound manner of the arguments given forth…you least of all.

PB: “Iran is being painted as the next big, bad wolf”

RS: For such a smart guy, how could you be so wrong?! The problem you’re facing? You’ve never lived in Iran as a Christian, or anywhere else as a Christian in the Middle East….good luck. Yes, not one American boy should be sacrificed to shut these maniacs down. So, when Israeli jets take off one night during Ramadan, remember I told you so….

PB: “Sanctions against Iran are a violation of the 2015 treaty”

RS: Are you kidding me?! A treaty with Iran, you say? Pastor, this is delusional. Find someone in your congregation that can teach you about Iran….let me elucidate for you a cardinal principle: the Saudis hate Iran, so they’re going to be good news for us. Period. The way of the world.

There is a God. Our rights come from Him. The purpose of civil government is to protect and secure God given rights.

This is the American View of Law and Government. It is also the Christian View. It is set forth very concisely and precisely in our Declaration of Independence.

Under this Christian, American view, civil government is charged with two principle functions.

First, civil government is responsible for protecting the integrity of our borders.

Secondly, civil government is duty bound to administer the justice system. However, in making and enforcing laws, civil government is required to follow God’s law as the ultimate standard to determine the validity of all earthly laws.

This ultimate standard which limits what civil government can do is referred to in the Declaration of Independence as “the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God”.

Although it was drafted and signed many years ago, the Declaration is still valid today. It is still the law of the land. Because it sets forth the principles upon which the validity of the Constitution and all statutes depend, the US Code refers to the Declaration as the Organic Law of these United States.

The Declaration is not void or invalid because it is old or because it acknowledges the Creator God as the Source of life and law and liberty. On the contrary, its principles are fresh and alive and vital. And both the knowledge of these principles – and their vitality in the hearts of Americans, are fundamental to the future of freedom.

Now, despite what we hear repeatedly today, the redistribution of wealth is NOT a function of government. There exists no valid authority for civil government to feed, clothe, or shelter anyone.

Frederick Bastiat, author of a famous book called “The Law” wrote the following words concerning redistribution of wealth which he termed “legal plunder”:

When plunder becomes a way of life for a group of men living together in society, they create for themselves, in the course of time, a legal system that authorizes it and a moral code that glorifies it.

Legal plunder occurs when government officials, who are charged with protecting our rights to property, actually become the thieves who covet and convert our property to their own uses. In other words, they use the authority of the law to break the law.

Obamacare serves as an example of this. The Constitution provides no authority for the Federal government to regulate any aspect of health care. Nevertheless, Obamacare is used to decimate the economy and destroy the most fundamental property right of all – the right to control our own bodies.

Of course, none of this could occur, without the prior adoption of the perverse moral code that Bastiat referred to. Legislatures, Executives and Courts who believe that they are so wise that they can redefine God-ordained marriage, limit your ability to defend yourself with a weapon, or declare the killing of babies to be legal represents both the lawless state of the civil government and the failure of Americans to keep their government servants “in check”.

The rule of law has now become the rule of lawlessness.

While the road back to lawful government is possible it will require not only your education but your painstaking commitment and resolve.

By Diann Morrison, Ph.D

SALEM, OR. -Thousands of President Trump supporters marched through Salem, Oregon’s capital city on March 25th 2017. They did it in support of President Trump, Vice President Pence, police officers, military, veterans and first responders. These were the forgotten man and woman that Donald Trump spoke of. Patriotic Americans who love this country. And support the man who says we, the people, have been empowered by voting for him to change the direction of our country. We are the men and women who knew that if we did not come out and vote for Donald Trump we would lose this country we love.

The rally begin with a prayer honoring God for giving us a land of milk and honey. Then the microphone was turned over to those in attendance to speak about what America means to them and how Donald Trump has changed their lives; how they honor those who are defending our country in the military; and to honor those brave soldiers who have served our country, the veterans; and the police officers who put their lives on the line every day to protect society; and the first responders who every day are out saving lives.

Dr. Diann Morrison-Wilson, co-organizer of the March had this to say “when Donald Trump said in his inaugural speech, “for too long, a small group in our nations capital has reap the rewards of government while the people have born the cost. Washington flourished but the people did not share its wealth. Politicians prospered, but the jobs left and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories…… while they celebrate it in our nation’s Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.” The crowd started chanting, Trump, Trump, Trump, USA, USA, USA.

When the crowd finally quieted,

She said, “President Trump has thrown open the window of the Washington cartel, the secrecy and corruption is evident to all Americans. Our president has empowered us to take over this Country with our votes. We are their boss and they will be accountable to us, in the next election cycle.

“Look at Oregon’s capital city, our politicians are bleeding the average taxpayer, taxing them so they don’t bring much money home, large building contractors are saying they can no longer stay in business because of the high taxes; Oregon’s politicians are also faring well, while the masses in Oregon face unemployment, poverty and a sense of isolation, while they grow big government through its PERS Program; giving freebies to illegal immigrants such as healthcare, housing, and to other Oregonians who choose not to work.

Our politicians provide freebies by using hard earned Oregonians tax dollars.”

Her passion for the forgotten man and woman in Oregon was evident. She called out to the crowd, “we need each other to issue pink slips to a corrupt governor, US Senator Merkley, Defazio, ….. “. Our legislators are some of the highest paid in the nation, and they pay the government employees extremely high wages. That’s because of their

PERS Program and growing big government. We cannot allow these politicians to continue to prosper as they shut down our timber industries, mining and fishing. They protect themselves at the cost of us citizens.”

She concluded with, “this has been an extremely successful March, for you are the silent majority, Who have left the comfort of your homes, to take part in changing our government. Because after all, “we the people,” have a voice now in Donald Trump, who said, “we will be forgotten no longer. That we are part of millions who have become part of a historic movement , The likes of which the world has never seen before.” “Thank you for all coming. ”"

Grants Pass, OR. —Josephine County, like most medium and large sized cities and counties in Oregon, employs a Legal Counsel. The Legal Counsel is the attorney for the county. On one hand, the job is highly specialized in that very few members of the bar have the training or experience to do this kind of work. On the other hand, legal counsels have been called the ultimate general practitioners because they must know, or be able to quickly learn, something about nearly every area of the law.

The mission of the Josephine County Legal Counsel is to provide representation and legal guidance to the County regarding matters that pertain to the community as a whole. The general goals of the office include:

1. Protect the county from liability.

2. Effectively and efficiently handle routine legal matters (public contracts, leases, lawsuits, questions, research, etc) for Josephine County.

3. Provide as many viable legal options to decision-makers as possible. The Legal Counsel does not decide policy, but rather facilitates the goals of policy makers and the electorate as a whole.

4. Provide guidance that conforms at all times to the letter and spirit of the law.

5. Appropriately prioritize the work to satisfy realistic deadlines.

6. Be available, approachable, and accurate. We do not promise to achieve perfection, but we pledge to pursue it.

7. Administer an effective law library for the benefit of the citizens and the local legal community.

My staff and I work very hard to achieve these goals. Besides myself, my office includes one other practicing attorney, a Legal Administrator who does paralegal work, a half-time Legal Secretary and the part-time availability of the County Law Librarian. Our typical duties and responsibilities include:

• Prepare pleadings, briefs, motions and other court documents.

• Provide verbal or written legal opinions upon appropriate request.

• Give legal advice, analysis and recommendations.

• Perform complex legal research as necessary.

• Interpret proposed and current legislation and administrative rules.

• Prepare, review, and analyze proposed and current leases and public contracts.

• Represent the county in selected trial and appellate courts and before administrative bodies.

• Prepare and review drafts of proposed ordinances, referrals, orders, resolutions and amendments.

• Advise on questions regarding the county’s legal liabilities.

• Attend meetings of various groups when appropriate or as requested.

• Prepare ballot titles for county measures before elections.

• Coordinate responsibilities and duties of Josephine County regarding service districts and special district formation and annexation.

• Communicate with attorneys representing other parties who are dealing with the county.

• Provide other related functions as an attorney regarding matters that pertain to the community as a whole.

One of our current projects involves publishing, and subsequently reviewing, a codebook of County ordinances. For decades the county ordinances have been almost inaccessible to public research because they are not systematically codified. In the summer of 2014, Legal Counsel reopened the codification project to produce an easily accessible and searchable code of county ordinances. The project is well underway and the finished product is scheduled to be available online later this year.

Additionally, the Legal Counsel is now successfully working with the County Planning Department and the Oregon Land Use Board of Appeals to provide searchable, electronic files of planning cases that have been appealed. Though this requires extra staff effort, the practice has been well received by the parties and court. It also potentially saves paper.

The office of Legal Counsel is, and should be, the primary source of information on legal issues for the County government. My office provides support to the commissioners and all the governmental departments, ranging from simple requests for information to detailed legal opinions on a wide variety of topics. Legal Counsel provides information directly to the public on occasion, but typically the office connects with the public indirectly.

If a citizen or group raises a legal question with the commissioners or a County department, the question will probably be passed to Legal Counsel. The answer will then be relayed back to the citizen or group. In this way the Legal Counsel serves the public through the County government.

Good government requires informed input from citizens and informed decisions by government officials. Consequently, the Legal Counsel frequently provides advice regarding public meetings and public records. The Legal Counsel staff devotes a substantial amount of time and effort to satisfying public records requests and ensuring that the County government adheres to the letter and the spirit of the applicable laws. The Legal Counsel does not take positions on questions of public policy, but rather provides an impartial legal vetting of the options available to policy makers or the electorate as a whole. On occasion the Legal Counsel fields questions from the press or the public to clarify the background of certain issues.

Clearly, the elected Legal Counsel is an extremely important position for Josephine County. It is my enormous honor and privilege to serve our community in this role. Thank you for your support.

370,https://newswithviews.com/does-the-constitution-need-to-be-interpreted/,newswithviews,Does the constitution need to be interpreted?,[],"Does the constitution need to be interpreted?

Ever since the US Constitution was ratified the question asked over and over is: who has the prerogative and responsibility to interpret the Constitution? Early on, the Supreme Court assumed the right to exercise this function but nowhere in the words of the Constitution (the document itself) is this practice authorized.

Before jumping to the conclusion that the Constitution requires interpreting and accepting anyone’s interpretation, I would ask what I consider a much more pertinent question and its corollary: Does the Constitution need to be interpreted, and if so why?

I can think of only three possible reasons why our Constitution would need interpreting which I will list and examine in the increasing level of likelihood and incidence of interpretation.

• The way a clause is worded doesn’t make sense.

• The way a clause is worded is ambiguous or imprecise.

• Part of the Constitution doesn’t say what we want it to say.

As I will demonstrate, interpret generally is used as a euphemism for disregard or make the Constitution say what its actual words don’t.

Case 1 – The way a clause is worded doesn’t make sense.

I can’t think of an example of such gross incompetence in the original Constitution, but the Twelfth Amendment states that a presidential Elector can’t vote for a presidential and vice-presidential candidate both from his own state.

The Electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot for President and Vice-President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves;

If you assume that the Electors were designed to cast a final vote, (which I don’t), that means that if the Electors are given a list of candidates and one presidential and one vice-presidential candidate are from Delaware, all of the Electors except those from Delaware could vote for both. What sense does that make? Someone needs to interpret some sense into that one.

Case 2 – The way a clause is worded is ambiguous or imprecise.

Probably the most glaring example of this concerns the issue of slavery, the worst blight in our history as a nation. This ambiguity allowed a practice to continue beyond the 20 year period that barred the federal government from interfering, while giving time for the states to get rid of that abhorrent practice. (see Article I Section 9, also Article V)

The migration, or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each person.

Even though they couldn’t bring themselves to write the words slave or slavery in the Constitution, by dancing around the issue with euphemisms, a conversion time was allotted. The only part of the system that ended up being addressed was the foreign slave trade which to the credit of congress was abolished in January of 1808. It took a horrible war which devastated the nation and claimed the lives of 620,000 Americans to finally resolve the issue.

Case 3 – Part of the Constitution doesn’t say what we want it to say.

Now we come to the part of the issue that seems both most pervasive and most perversive. This is the problem with most interpretations and interpreters. Rather than studying the Constitution and trying to figure out what it is saying, we usually try to find a way to make it say what we want it to say. By our “cut and paste” methodology—taking a piece here, ignoring a piece there, and interpreting a piece somewhere else, we arrive at a system of government that is a modified democracy rather than the modified federation that the original Constitution defined.

To illustrate this point, we can look at the First Amendment and the way that it has been interpreted.

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.

This amendment contains a list of things that congress may not do. Rather than follow the Constitution, our government has declared a wall of separation between church and state and made themselves the arbiter of that separation. Freedom of speech is now interpreted to include disruption of the daily activities of others and even destruction of property, and not only are we free to petition government but the First Amendment supposedly allows rowdy gathering and protesting of any entity or organization that seems to be doing or not doing things the particular mob assembled wants them to do or quit doing. How does that become peaceably assembling? What freedom of speech and freedom of religion do not include are things like prayer in schools and expressions like “Merry Christmas” or “God Bless You”. If Congress can make no law concerning these things, where did all this nonsense come from?

Probably the most common interpretation given to the Constitution by educated people who should know better, is the notion that it defines a two-party (or any party) system of government. Unfortunately the “two-party system” is the system that supplanted “Constitutional Federalism” when America turned its collective back on the original Constitution. It happened so early in our history that Americans almost without exception assume that party politics is constitutional. It led to replacing the recommendations of the best presidential candidates by independent Electors to the confirmation of the least-worst options as determined by a party-controlled popular vote between self-nominated and self-interested demagogues who bribe the people with legislative promises which they have no constitutional authority to fulfill if they do get elected.

Most of the time the popular vote for President coincides with the party manipulated electoral votes, but the election of 2016 was an exception. Now there are many who are trying to manipulate the vote of the Electors in different directions. It will be interesting to see how this works out. There is some hope that this confusion will lead to a study of the actual words of the Constitution and the concepts that those words convey. Time will tell.

Article VI of the Constitution reads:

The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the members of the several state legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, both of the United States and of the several states, shall be bound by oath or affirmation, to support this Constitution;…

which invites this rhetorical question: when the officers take the oath to support this Constitution, are they bound by the words of the Constitution or by some interpretation; and if so which one?

Having analyzed the reasons why the Constitution could need some interpretation, I conclude that what is needed most is careful study of the actual words of the Constitution by both the elected officials and all Americans. This study must include a look at the whole picture not just a few select pieces. If the incumbents do not follow the Constitution, they must be replaced. If after careful study, changes seem appropriate, let them be made by amendment not by interpretation.

As George Washington said in his farewell address:

It is important, likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free country should inspire caution in those entrusted with its administration, to confine themselves within their respective constitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to create, whatever the form of government, a real despotism.

A just estimate of that love of power, and proneness to abuse it, which predominates in the human heart, is sufficient to satisfy us of the truth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the exercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into different depositaries, and constituting each the guardian of the public weal against invasions by the others, has been evinced by experiments ancient and modern; some of them in our country and under our own eyes. To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute them. If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution designates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, in one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent must always greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient benefit, which the use can at any time yield.

By NWV Senior Political News Writer, Jim Kouri

Antifascist (ANTIFA) groups in the United States have become far more organized, equipped, funded, and even trained in special camps to bring about large-scale social disruption, public and private property damage (arson and looting), destruction of businesses, financial loss in the public and private sectors, and high-profile violent clashes with law enforcement preferably with the news cameras capturing police using force against ANTIFA members, according to intelligence and security expert Dr. Lyle Rapacki.

These groups are sorely underestimated by many city and other elected officials, while other officials actually encourage them to participate in violence and destruction. For example, during her presidential campaign Democrat Hillary Clinton compared police officers to the radical Islamists who comprise the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

Do not confuse these zealots with the hippie rioters of the Vietnam War era of the late 1960’s, said Dr. Rapacki in his email intelligence briefing.

He noted that members of ANTIFA are extremely mean-spirited and prone to violence. Recruitment programs seek members as young as 6th graders in public school. The current government education system encompasses indoctrination into Marxism that is hardly hidden; whether for young students or college age adults (18-28) who comprise the largest block within the organization.

“Today’s teachers are more concerned with indoctrinating students than in educating them. Their idea of educating youngsters is more in line with the Hitler Youth in Nazi Germany or the Palestinian terrorist children’s summer camps in the Gaza Strip,” said former police detective and military intelligence operative Michael Snipes.

The ability to be mobile, bringing additional resources to multiple cities simultaneously, is also a new development aided by large cash infusions from financial pockets dedicated to the overthrow of America, her values and principles, traditions and form of government intent on creating a Communist system. This is not mere philosophy or flashy talking points, this is the “end goal” of the Antifa movement.

The Obligations of active ANTIFA members is to:

Track white nationalists and Far Right groups in every region of the United States. This includes over the internet, public records, and surveillance.

Oppose public Far Right organizing whatever it takes, and disrupt and crush all activities and even individual members.

Support all anti-fascist groups aligned under the banner of ANTIFA.

Build a culture of non-cooperation with law enforcement. This includes violent confrontations, use of unsophisticated items like Molotov cocktails, M80s, pepper spray, balloons filled with urine and/or feces thrown at LE.

Knowing about a threat…knowing how to respond to a threat might make all the difference between successfully repelling an attack or succumbing to an attack; whether from terrorism or domestic violence or criminal activity, or even becoming a victim in a catastrophic event “down the street.” If you are a leader of a business or corporation or the leader of a family, knowing what could jeopardize the safety, well-being and continuity of your business or family could determine if you will still enjoy your business or family after the threat announces itself.

Lyle Rapacki earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Political Science and a Master’s Degree in Counseling from Northern Arizona University and his Doctorate from Clayton College of Natural Medicine specializing in the treatment of psychological disorders with natural medicine. He enjoyed a 20-year private practice. Approximately one-half of his practice case-load was delegated to Behavioral Forensic Profiling and Threat Assessments, and he earned a Post-Doctorate Diplomate in Forensic Counseling. A former police officer, Dr. Rapacki assisted law enforcement from 1985 – 1991 regionally and nationally with intelligence analysis and investigations of deviant movement groups and taught at law enforcement academies nationwide. From 2000 to 2005, Dr. Rapacki taught in the Criminal Justice Department at Wayland Baptist University Phoenix campus. He briefly held the position of Director for the Public Safety Administration, Homeland Security and Crisis Management Programs at Grand Canyon University in Phoenix, Arizona in 2008.

Everyone is having a cow over Trump criticizing AG Jeff Sessions for removing himself from the absurd FBI investigation that Trump stole the election by scheming with the Russians. Clearly, Sessions was clueless as to what the Trump Administration continues to deal with. Out of their minds with rage over Trump defeating Hillary and dismantling Obama’s tyrannical legacy, Leftists have launched civil war on Trump and his voters. No tactic is too low, dishonest or too evil.

Sessions stepping down from the FBI Trump/Russian FBI investigation was the equivalent of bringing an olive branch to a gunfight. Sessions did not win any goodwill from Leftists for his unnecessary and unwise decision to step aside. Quite the opposite. Leftists saw Sessions recusing himself as a sign of weakness, blood it the water.

Trump had every right to be annoyed, as was I. It is extremely crucial that Trump surround himself with warriors who understand what he and We the People are up against.

Don’t get me wrong. I like and respect Sessions. He is a good man. However, by stepping aside from the FBI investigation Sessions behaved like a typical Republican, trying to show Leftists who want him politically dead that he is an honorable Republican. Meanwhile, Democrats and fake news media are plotting 24/7 and pulling every dirty gutter trick in the book to remove our president.

Fake news media tried to pressure Sessions into resigning, claiming it is impossible for Sessions to continue after the president has expressed a lack of confidence in him. Fake news media are enemies of We the People and the Trump Administration. Therefore, their call for Sessions to quit is yet another dirty trick; an opportunity to further their ongoing narrative that the Trump Administration is a mess. Remember, Leftists’ goal is to flood the airways with negatives about Trump 24/7.

Thank God, Sessions did not fall for it. Sessions says he has no intention of resigning. I pray this is a sign that Sessions finally gets it, realizing the deceitful anti-Trump scoundrels we must defeat.

The Special Council investigating Trump has gotten out of hand. Robert Mueller has a small army of Obama and Clinton supportive anti-Trump lawyers wearing latex gloves. They are giving Trump’s business dealings with Russia a deep anal exam going back ten years. Are we expected to believe the absurd allegation that Trump began colluding with Russia ten years ago to steal the election? Mueller’s anti-Trump lawyers will thrust their investigative arms deep into the caverns of Trump’s business for however long it takes to find something to remove him from the Oval Office.

Considering that no human being is perfect, it is likely Mueller’s hit squad will find a nugget of something to blow up as an excuse to impeach Trump.

Why aren’t Republicans standing up for our president, righteously raising heck over this never ending unprecedented intrusion into his business affairs. Meanwhile, these same Leftist lawyers who are performing a deep probe into Trump’s business practices supported Obama keeping his college transcripts a secret. Why isn’t Trump’s DOJ shutting this overreaching nonsense down; saying enough is enough; stop this insanity?

I suspect many in the GOP are still never-Trump or still don’t get it. Remarkably, some Republicans still naively believe they will not be trashed by fake news media if they can prove they are fair-minded good guys who seek to work with the democrats. Meanwhile, democrats and fake news media interpret Republicans extending olive branches as weakness to be exploited; an opportunity to plunge a dagger into Trump and Republicans’ political hearts.

Far too many people supposedly on our side do not appear to realize that we are in a battle for the heart and soul of America; patriots vs Leftists. Thank God, Trump understands this reality and is willing to fight pedal to the metal. This is why he was annoyed by Sessions stepping down, surrendering ground to our enemies. His cabinet needs to stop playing footsie with our enemies and get with the program. You give Leftists an inch and they will take a mile.

We the People elected Trump to do battle with anti-America Leftists. Despite fake news polls, we remain firmly in Trump’s corner, ready for battle. We are prayed up. We trust God and have kept our powder dry. Let’s roll Mr President.

By NWV Senior Political News Writer, Jim Kouri

“A growing number of American citizens are wondering if so-called progressives in the Democratic Party are more dangerous to the nation than radicalized Muslims or the bloodthirsty gang members of the infamous MS-13.” – Terry Saunders, NYPD-Ret.

Republican Congressman Steve Scalise, the House Whip, and several others were shot at a baseball practice Wednesday morning at a recreational facility in Alexandria, Virginia. The Republicans were practicing for an upcoming charity congressional baseball game. There were no democrats present, they had practiced earlier in the morning.

A man was seen wandering around and he had asked Rep. Ron DeSantis, “Are you Democrats or Republicans?” When DeSantis replied, “Republicans,” the suspect walked away and then returned as he began blasting.

Scalise was shot in the hip and underwent surgery. He is listed in stable condition, his office said. Representative Roger Williams and Matt Mika, who works as a lobbyist for Tyson Foods, were also victims, but expected to fully recover. Mika was there as a coach since he was a former baseball player.

The shooter, described as a middle-aged white male with dark hair, was taken to a local hospital where he died from his gunshot wounds. His actions were described by police officers as a premeditated attack on unarmed civilians. The suspect was James T. Hodgkinson of Belleville, Ill., according to members of the Capitol Police Department.

This politically-motivated attack was merely the latest in a series of violence-prone attacks on President Donald Trump and Republican politicians and activists by those calling for Trump’s removal from office.

The Liberal-Left Conspiracy?

* A Bernie Sanders for President campaign worker — 66-year-old James Hodgkinson — was killed by Capitol Police officers after the Democrat opened fire on House Republican Whip Congressman Steve Scalise, and wounding others.

* Last week, Shakespeare In The Park simulated the violent stabbing death of President Trump in the play ‘Julius Caesar’. Caesar and his wife looked much like Trump and his former fashion model wife.

* Third-rate comic Kathy Griffin posed with a bloody severed head which was supposed to be that of President Trump.

“What’s even more disturbing is the news media pretending to be shocked over the shooting of Rep. Scalise and others, while they trot out their usual Democratic Party hacks such as Rep. Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders, and other Democratic talking heads. These are the same people along with Hillary Clinton who have urged their leftist followers to “resist” the Trump administration no matter what the cost,” warned former NYPD police detective Mike Snipes.

Snipes says this latest round of Democratic Party-sponsored violence began when the Obama administration bashed and condemned police officers when they used deadly force on minority suspects. A number of law enforcement officers were killed as a result of the cop-bashing.

It doesn’t take a giant leap for devotees of Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and other progressive leaders to transition their suggestive violent messages from police officers to conservative officeholders.

New Jersey Democratic Strategist Defends Killing Republicans

“The GOP must realize that there is a violently hateful streak that’s reaching epidemic proportions within today’s Democratic Party. And their leaders are encouraging it.” – Former Police Counter-Terrorism Unit Member Bettina Lawrence-Tidwell

Republican Congressman Steve Scalise, the House Majority Whip, and several others were shot during a baseball practice on Wednesday morning at a recreational facility in Alexandria, Virginia. The Republicans were practicing for an upcoming charity congressional baseball game. There were no democrats present at that time since they had practiced earlier in the morning.

After the shooter — a former Bernie Sanders campaign worker named James T. Hodgkinson — left Rep. Scalise in critical condition and wounded four others including two police officers, a New Jersey Democratic political strategist responded by introducing the hashtags #HuntRepublicans and #HuntRepublicanCongressmen to his Twitter account: “We are in a war with selfish, foolish & narcissistic rich people. Why is it a shock when things turn violent? #HuntRepublicanCongressmen.”

“Devine is the kind of political activist Marx had in mind when he advised: ‘Accuse others of what you do.’ In the Democrats case, they have the full support and help of the majority of news people,” said former police officer and security director Walter Piedmont. “They accused Tea Party demonstrators of being violent when there is no violence while the leftist Democrats actually embrace the use of violence and vitriol,” Piedmont added.

The vitriolic Devine has pursued public office and has been a consultant for numerous New Jersey Democratic campaigns. He also worked in the offices of New Jersey lawmakers.

Devine said on one of his posts: “If you want to invite a class war, then you have to expect people to fight back at some point.”

He also wrote on Facebook that he felt “little sympathy” for Scalise because he doesn’t support gun control and is liked by the National Rifle Association (NRA) and other Second Amendment supporters.

Besides Republicans, who have not displayed much outrage, there were some New Jersey Democrats who criticized Devine and told reporters that they did not endorse violence.

Devine has refused to apologize and has continued using the hashtags calling for violent action against Republican officeholders and their supporters.

“I am sorry if my #HuntRepublicanCongressmen hashtag hurt the feelings of any GOP snowflakes but you have not engaged in civil discourse,” Devine said on Twitter late Thursday afternoon.

But the Democratic Party rebel-rouser is not as squeaky-clean as he pretends. For example, in 2014 Devine was convicted for shoplifting lettuce, protein powder and hair conditioner.

And the following year, New Jersey election officials charged Devine with almost two-dozen separate election-law violations. The Election Law Enforcement Commission claimed he never reported nearly $79,000 in contributions and more than $70,000 in expenditures involving his Central Jersey Democratic Leadership Committee.

“What’s even more disturbing is the news media pretending to be shocked over the shooting of Rep. Scalise and others, while they trot out their usual Democratic Party hacks such as Rep. Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders, and other Democratic talking heads. These are the same people along with Hillary Clinton who have urged their leftist followers to “resist” the Trump administration no matter what the cost,” warned former NYPD police detective Mike Snipes.

374,https://newswithviews.com/americans-oblivious-to-the-approaching-storm/,newswithviews,Americans Oblivious To The Approaching Storm,[],"Americans Oblivious To The Approaching Storm

A while back we attended an evening meeting of over 30 rural landowners, in which a couple of auditors of a land use department were there to collect stories of government abuse, for the purposes of an audit. They got an un-expected ear full. As the two auditors were leaving the meeting, one of them was overheard to say, “I had no idea it was this bad.” One might ask how they could be so blind when the rural landowners of this county had been yelling from the rooftops for years, about the egregious injustices that are being foisted on them by an over-bloated, CITY-RUN, county council.

In the spirit of surprising civilized behavior, one by one, the landowner’s stories came pouring out, sometimes punctuated with a few expletives, sometimes with passion bordering on wanting to do physical harm to the perpetrators of their extended grief. Words like Gestapo, brown shirts, Nazism, communism and socialism were frequently on the lips of the landowners, as they related their individual experiences with land use code enforcement officers.

But what was entirely overlooked by those attending the meeting and by the auditors themselves, was that this was just a symptom of a much greater evil, an evil that is being perpetrated on an American minority, with little or no representation in the government process. An evil that is foisted on this minority by the tyranny of a majority (city folk) who have bought into the “green” lie that the environment must be protected, no matter how much it costs, or how many individual and property rights that the minority has to give up to implement what can be generously called, a draconian, environmental government policy. This evil has all the characteristics of mass or religious hysteria. It is an evil that totally ignores the rights protected by the 5th Amendment to our cherished Constitution, the absolute requirement by government to provide “due process” and “just compensation” when “TAKING” private property. It is also an evil that violates another section of our Constitution, the “equal protection clause“. The rural minority is being asked to bear almost the entire burden of environmental protection, for the benefit of the constitutionally ignorant and naive urban dwellers, who have been duped into thinking they have the right to usurp the property rights of their rural brethren with their votes.

But all this grief being dumped on rural landowners is coming from the top down. It comes out of a spineless U. S. Congress that daily violates their oath of office to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. It comes from wealthy environmental groups. It comes from Europe and the United Nations with their fully expressed goal to take the land away from private citizens in America. It is formal UN policy that: “Private land ownership is a principal instrument of accumulation and concentration of wealth and therefore contributes to social injustice…. Public ownership of land and public control of land use is therefore indispensable.” Think Agenda 21.

America is a member of the United Nations and has ratified many of their social and environmental goals by executive order and Congressional legislation. Even one of the U. S. Supreme Court justices (Ginsberg) outrageously believes that we must look at European laws and statutes, when adjudicating American law or legislation.

These national and international injustices are further extended into state and then local governments, as it filters down from the UN, the President (Executive Orders) and the Congress that pass “green” legislation that fully violates the Constitution, if not putting at risk our very liberty. Trump has reversed many of these trickle-down laws and rules, but there are so many of them. He can only put a small dent in this tangled web of government tyranny by rule of law.

But let’s be frank here. Let’s say what many think, but don’t have the courage to say. Had federal, state or local governments done what they are now doing to the rural minority 100 years ago, the guns would have come out and some government officials would be either shot, hung, or tarred and feathered. As a matter of fact, such things did happen over 100 years ago, when rural landowners wouldn’t bow down to anyone, but especially they wouldn’t bow down to government officials, politicians and bureaucrats alike, who would trespass on their rights, or their land.

In spite of this past history, we still abhor violence and do not condone it, knowing full well that it just leads to more violence. We can win without violence, but we will only win when enough Americans decide that freedom is more important than their pleasure, or their assets. With government holding all the political power, all the money (our money that they use against us) and an enforcement arm (police) that will take on the people with guns, but shield the politicians and the bureaucrats from the people, our task is formidable. That is why you see armed and uniformed police officers at almost every public meeting these days, in every small and large corner of America, to protect the politicians from the anger of the people. They fear us, but they don’t fear us enough.

Unfortunately, today, the fight has gone out of the people. They want to be civilized, they want to be nice and avoid a fight. Sadly, being nice just enables government to do more against us. After all, if the people fought they might endanger some of their creature comforts. So the job is left to the few of us who have the courage to stick our heads up above the noise level and call tyranny what it is, tyranny.

The hard truth is, that if those of us who are fighting are left to our own resources to take on the almighty government, we will eventually be crushed. (i.e. Bundy, Hammond, Nettleton, Hage, etc.) If they could crush us now, they would, but so far we still have the right of free speech and we can still call out government injustices and rising tyranny.

But if government can take away one right, which they have, they certainly have the power to take away our other rights whether urban or rural. If left alone, where the people do not hold government to its constitutional limits, the rest of our constitutional rights are headed for the garbage dump.

But then hey, it’s your freedom to preserve, protect and defend, or not. What you do, or don’t do, will have lasting affect on your children and grandchildren. We can certainly understand your desire to be civilized and be nice, so as not to put at risk your hard-won creature comforts but it won’t save liberty. Just so long as you have your car, your boat, your home, your job and your vacations, it would be foolish on your part to make waves. Right? After all, let the other guy take the heat, why should you? That’s exactly what the German people did during the rise of Hitler.

Sure we could use your HELP, but after eleven years in the heat of this battle we know that we, like so many of us who really care about America, are mostly left to fight Goliath on our own. That is especially true of the rural landowner who is besieged by a constant barrage of new land use and environmental laws about which the landowner knows nothing until he gets a notice of violation in the mail, or some drunk-with-power code enforcement officer knocks on his door.

IMPORTANT NEWS FOR AMERICA’S RURAL LANDOWNERS:

Please consider this information as a public service notice regarding powerful new information about the rights of rural landowners to exclude anyone from their property, including government agents and law enforcement . Our organization receives many complaints from landowners, all across America, saying that government and law enforcement believe they have the right to come on your property any time they feel like it under federal, state, or local law and unfortunately they do. But you can revoke that law . Allow us to explain.

The right to legally trespass on property by law enforcement and government agents is supported by the “knock and talk” implied license, as set forth in precedent law by U. S. Supreme Court cases, Breard v. Alexander 341 U. S. 622 (1951) and Florida v. Jardines 133 S. CT 1409 (2013). However, under a 10th Circuit case C:13-CR-00006-RAW-2 (2016) legal authority was granted to the property owner the right to REVOKE that implied license by proper signage.

In our stated goal of acting as advocates for rural landowners, NARLO has developed a copyrighted, powerful “REVOCATION OF IMPLIED LICENSE” No Trespass sign that provides notice to government and law enforcement that the “Implied License” under the U. S. Supreme Court cases cited above, has been revoked by the landowner. Please note that federal law has priority over state and local law.

Our new sign is a powerful companion to NARLO’s large 18″ x 24″ No Trespassing sign and is purposely designed to be mounted above the large sign, or the new sign can stand alone on its own. There is no other sign this powerful in keeping government agents and law enforcement off your property, anywhere on the market, backed up by the law.

Take a look at our copyrighted No Trespass sign HERE.

Landowners must organize: If landowners really want to fight back when government comes calling with an unconstitutional land use fine or notice of violation, they must form a group of rural landowners and start a NARLO County Chapter in their state, like the landowners in Garfield County, Utah did.

Be sure and share this information with your rural friends. They need to know.

FOR AMERICA’S CITY DWELLERS:

Remember! It’s the rural landowner that provides the food you eat. If government can take away the rights of rural landowners, they can just as easily take away the rights of those who live in cities. Government has and is, but the city dweller is unaware of what is going on behind their backs. If city dwellers buy into radical environmentalism (climate change, etc.) and the social justice propaganda being fed to the American people every day from government and in our schools, our colleges and in the news media, they will literally be committing American liberty and sovereignty suicide. Unfortunately, tens of millions of city dwellers have been drinking the government Kool-Aid and have been converted to hopelessly naive’ socialists.

The city vote has virtually destroyed any semblance of constitutional law in America and city dwellers are totally unaware of the approaching storm they’ve created. America is bankrupt. Congress is impotent. The courts are a stacked deck. The borders are more than porous. Civic violence and crime are increasing. Terrorists will continue to attack us. Our schools and colleges are indoctrination centers and the people are losing their honor, integrity and morality in exchange for drugs, pleasure and entertainment.

To peacefully restore our Constitutional Republic, if it can even be restored, will take the combined, dedicated and coordinated efforts of millions of Americans who still cherish freedom. In the end, it may take guns.

It is rare in these days to see such unashamed anti-Zionism displayed loud and proud by a seemingly conservative author, whose language and arguments are, however, more appropriate to the vile socialist left. Mr. Baldwin resorts to demagoguery by mixing together both valid and very invalid issues, i.e., anti-Zionism rants. [Link]

It is surely a valid observation that the spread of homosexuality in America is not confronted enough by our spiritual leaders, and worse, some priests and rabbis pander to and fear the homosexual Mafia more than God.

Yet, it is wrong and ugly to speak about Zionism as though something reprehensible.(*) It is wrong to blame renowned pastors such as John Hagee for their friendliness to the State of Israel and for being a Christian Zionist. In fact, every consistent Christian must be a Christian Zionist as I will explain. And, it is particularly ugly to blame the President-elect Donald J. Trump, for his promises to honor the rights of Israel for her land and capital, while the entire world, pandering to the left and Islam, have turned hatred against the Jewish Homeland.

It is both base and ugly to sarcastically characterize the year 2017 and Trump’s presidency as though it represents “The Year of the Zionists.” Your language, Pastor Baldwin, is no different than that of the Soviet Politburo. What a badge of honor you wear!

Let me clarify some of the basics of Zionism for you, Pastor Baldwin.

1) In a secular sense, Zionism is merely a case of the general formula that “Nation X belongs to people X” just as France belongs to the French, Britain belongs to the Brits, Germany to Germans, Spain to Spaniards, Greece to the Greeks, and yes, Israel to the Jews! Zionism is no different than Frenchism, Germanism, etc., except that the Jews ownership of their land began 3,000 years ago, before France, Britain, and Germany even existed.

2) The restoration of Israel on her ancient land is an act of immense significance in terms of both social and spiritual justice. Since ancient times, Israel has been a victim of colonialism and oppression. Therefore, as a socialissue, Zionism is the most justified case of a national liberation movement, one which delivered the Jewish people, victims of extreme oppression and genocide for centuries, to their national liberation and the restoration of their nationhood.

3) As a spiritual issue, Zionism is a realization of God’s plan, an act of the highest spiritual value for Jews and consistent Christians. Yet, Israel is the only nation refused basic justice by the rest of the world, the world which was ready to sacrifice Israel for whatever minute reason, or for no reason at all. Any expectations of justice for Israel from this world are futile (Eric Hoffer).

To be a Zionist is a badge of honor. That is Zionism. To be an anti-Zionist is a mark of baseness.

4) Pastor Baldwin, you are saying that contemporary Israel is not exactly like the model promised by God…fair enough. However, who else is such a model? Whose existence, security, and national interests are questioned and conditioned by other foreign nations? Here is a quote for you. Remember Europe in the 1930s?

Ask yourself this:

• Is it possible for the whole world to be against Jews? Yes.

• Is it possible that the whole world can be wrong? Yes. • What was the motivating factor then? Antisemitism.

• What is the motivating factor today? Antisemitism. • Then the world opposed the existence of one Jew.

• Today the world opposes the existence of one Jewish state.

Back then, the world opposed the existence of one Jew. Today, the world opposes the existence of one Jewish State. And yet you are concerned with 2017 being “The Year of the Zionists” for America.

5) America was founded as a Judeo-Christian nation, not anything else. It is a spiritual obligation of America to take the side of Christians and Jews in world affairs. And, it is in America’s national interests to support Israel, the only free nation in the Middle East, and America’s strongest ally in the region.

As Eric Hoffer wrote in 1968 “Israel is our only reliable and unconditional alley. We can rely more on Israel than Israel can rely on us.” [Link] These bitter words are even more true now. And you, Pastor Baldwin, are displeased already about future actions of President Donald J. Trump towards making America a more reliable and honest ally of Israel! Shame on you and your ministry!

(*) It is very puzzling and illogical of the hatred to Israel by Western nations and some of their so-called conservatives. Their actions and reasoning exactlyreplicate the Soviet Politburo.

Soviets hated Israel for too many reasons. First of all, because she allied with America and the West rather than with the Soviets, and because the Soviets hated the very possibility that some small fraction of their population may even contemplate the idea of leaving the USSR for good, or even to be somehow associated with Jewry in the external world. This is the exact reason that Soviets made Zionism a curse word, and a reason for persecution in the USSR! Even learning Hebrew could trigger criminal prosecution back then.

Indeed, the KGB created the PLO, Arafat and the so-called “Palestinian people,” (trained in various Soviet military camps, including one near Odessa, the city where I lived.) And, indeed, it was Soviets who promoted the UN resolution equating Zionism and Fascism (a gross cynicism in itself). But that was the USSR.

To imagine that anyone in the West would follow the same propaganda line is unthinkable! It is as if the West borrowed the Soviet talking points for bashing the allies of the West such as South Vietnam, South Korea, or West Germany! And yet, the West, and some of western conservatives, did borrow the Soviet talk points to bash Israel. That is a grotesque reality these days.

376,https://newswithviews.com/the-mullahs-ruling-iran-are-not-iranians/,newswithviews,The Mullahs ruling Iran are not Iranians,[],"The Mullahs ruling Iran are not Iranians

Being Iranian is defined by a state of mind, not by a place of residence. The barbaric Islamist mullahs and their mercenaries presently ruling Iran are not Iranians. They are Islamofascists who have betrayed their magnificent heritage and have enlisted themselves in the service of a most oppressive, discriminating, and demeaning ideology.

Iranians are proud spiritual descendants of King Cyrus the Great, the author of the first charter of human rights. Some of Cyrus’ children live in the patch of land called Iran. The overwhelming majority—free humans with human beliefs—live in every country, city, and village of the earth.

These world-wide people, one and all, irrespective of nationality, color, or creed are Iranians because they all adhere to the Cyrus Charter; they practice and defend its lofty tenets; and, transfer this precious humanity’s treasure to the next generation.

Unequivocal genetic findings have clearly established that biologically there is only one human race; that the genetic variation within a single troop of chimpanzees, for instance, is greater than that of any two human groupings, no matter how different they may appear physically.

What makes people different is not their biology, but the “software” that runs them. There is ample proof to support the above assertion. A case in point is the present menace posed by the people whose life is programmed by the software of Islam: an ideology anathema to the Cyrus Charter. And the results are self-evident. Hate, superstition, violence, and a raft of other inhuman beliefs drives these religious fascists. These captive followers of the primitive Islamic Charter are both the perpetrators and the victims of much suffering. The result is backward Islamic societies that are intent at dragging the rest of the world into the same sorry state. Misery likes company, it is said.

We recognize that the dysfunctional Islamic software is deeply engrained in the minds of many Muslims who opt to remain in mental bondage rather than purge their minds of the Islamic software and join the rest of the human family with a new emancipating program for life—liberty.

Islamic clergy, the parasitic prime beneficiaries of Islam, are master practitioners of the carrot and stick strategy. By drawing heavily from the Quran and the Hadith, the conniving mullahs and imams have assembled a potent arsenal of threats and promises to keep the faithful in line. They had little trouble in so doing, since Islamic scripture is replete with graphic horrific punishment awaiting the wayward and the unbelievers, while the rewards for the obedient docile, if he is male, are described as endless variety of sensual pleasures. Anyone daring to leave the corral of Islam is apostate and automatically condemned to death. And that’s just for starters. The punishment awaiting the ungrateful deserter of the one and only true path, Islam threatens, is a raft of horrific eternal torment in Allah’s hell.

And for the true faithful—the mindless robot—the promised rewards, all physical pleasures, are infinite and eternal.

In spite of these horrid threats and empty promises, more and more people are beginning to recognize Islam for what it is. It is difficult, but not impossible to leave the fraudulent Islam’s captivity. Hundreds of thousands have done so successfully and have enjoyed the blessings of liberty.

A great threat facing free people is the recently petrodollar energized Islam embarking on a campaign of recruiting more people under its dark banner. Millions of disenfranchised underclasses in the non-Islamic world, and millions more mentally under-developed may flock to Islam, deluded by its empty promises.

Islam is no longer in its own self-made cage. It has broken out and has established powerful presence in much of the non-Islamic world. Islam is a charter of submission. It is a sworn enemy of freedom and views the Cyrus Charter as heresy. Freedom and tyranny are incompatible. Free people must do all they can to preserve their birthright of liberty and assist others to break from the bondage of Islamic captivity.

The interdependent world community faces great challenges that demand a united effort, uncompromisingly based on justice, to meet the various ills it faces. We can no longer be complacent about events in distant world affecting alien people. Distances are bridged and alien people are now diverse members of the human family.

We honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. for proclaiming from a Birmingham jail, “Injustice anywhere is threat to justice everywhere.” To demand justice for others, he risked his life, left his native Georgia, and ended in jail of the-then-bigoted south—Birmingham, Alabama. We “Iranians” of the world—free humans—must do no less. We must demand justice for our belief-kin who are suffering under the yoke of Islamofascism in Iran or anywhere in the world.

We also do well to recall the example of an Irish-American President—John F. Kennedy—looking at the Communists’ Wall of Shame in Berlin, proclaiming, “Ich bin ein Berliner”— “I am a Berliner.” By so claiming, he helped rally free people of the world that brought down the wall and created a momentum that eventually swept the totalitarian Communist wall-builders into the dustbin of history.

Now the world is facing wall-builders of a different kind: the Islamofascists who have been at their shameless work for centuries. As their walls built with superstition, discrimination and blood are crumbling; they are intent at building walls in new territories.

But once again, human decency is rising to the challenge. This time in the voice and actions of billions of free people who proclaim: we are also children of Iran in the spirit of Cyrus the Great; “we meet any challenge and pay any price” to defeat Islamofascism; and, we will not rest until humanity is completely free of the despotic rule of Islam.

We Iranians and Iranian-Americans in spirit—free people of the world–greatly cherish liberty, where the mind is imbued with enlightenment, and every individual by the virtue of being born human is afforded measured freedom. It is within the open expanse of liberty that each and every person can be at his or her best. And when the individual person is at his best, humanity is at its best.

WHEREAS, JCRP analysis concluded that this will have a negative economic impact on citizens and business in Josephine County, regressively burdening Oregonians least able to afford those higher property taxes; and

WHEREAS, Josephine County Republican Party support’s public safety and the Josephine County Sheriff Department. However, Measure 17-80 offers no transparency and offers no detailed plan on how the $37+ million revenue windfall would be spent.

Measure 17-80 is contrary to the Oregon Republican Party platform of “No new taxes”.

NOW, THEREFORE, THE JOSEPHINE COUNTY REPUBLICAN PARTY

CONVENED THIS DAY of APRIL 23, 2017, RESOLVES AS FOLLOWS:

1. We believe that the economic consequences of ballot Measure 17-80’s passage would do serious damage to Southern Oregon’s economy and the citizens of Josephine County; and

2. We oppose the passage of ballot Measure 17-80; and

3. We urge all Josephine County Oregon voters to cast a NO vote on this costly and damaging ballot Measure.

Editor’s Note: We at NWV PREDICT, that if this measure passes, what the commissioner’s will do with the new found property tax money, is what they always do:

♦ Give raises and cost of living increases to county bureaucrats, already making over $75,000.00 per year.

♦ Put a big chunk of the money away for their retirement, P.E.R.S.

♦ Hire more code enforcers to write tickets to property owners

A couple of month ago commissioners were asked how the people’s money is being spent (line item budget). We are still waiting!"

We’ve said it so many times, it’s almost a truism. But it is true: liberals are insane.

Suppose you don’t believe in God, or any god; that the whole universe, yourself included, is only the product of pure chance, utterly devoid of any meaning. And suppose you’ve spent four or five years being taught, by highly-paid individuals with a lot of letters after their names, that there is no such thing as truth: there’s only “your truth” and someone else’s truth, but no true truth. And suppose you have been taught, from childhood up, that Science has the answers and really smart people, advised by scientists, have the right to power and authority over all those clods out there; and that if you play your cards right, you might become one of the chosen few. At the very least you’ll have the satisfaction of being a fan and follower of the best people, and thus vastly superior to those who aren’t.

Supposing that all of the above constitutes your worldview, how can it help but lead you into crazy places?

Last week the Advertising Standard Authority, an agency of the United Kingdom’s government, decreed a ban on all “gender stereotypes” in advertising, on the grounds that these might do real harm to people by leading to “unfavorable gender outcomes,” whatever the deuce those might be. There must be, in advertising, no acknowledgement of any differences at all between men and women, which ought to make it rather a challenge to create a sane commercial. Maybe replace the actors with, oh, shadows, or robots, that speak with sexless, computer-generated voices?

So we have the humanists, presumed to be the smartest people in the world, fleeing from one of the basic constituents of being human. Next they’ll resent being mammals: it will be denounced as an affront of Social Justice.

Here in America we have Bill Nye the Science Guy, former kids’ TV star, now one of The Wise, declaring that all us old Climate Change deniers will just have to “age out”—die off, he explains—before he and John Kerry and their buddies can take meaningful action to Save The Planet from Global Warming Etc. Another humanist who has a serious beef with humanity. By “action” he means giving government sweeping new powers to control and regulate every aspect of our lives. That probably means we won’t have toilet paper.

Again Britain is already on board with growing the government. Last week they sent a whole team of agents to shut down a five-year-old girl’s sidewalk lemonade stand. And that’s just their warmup tosses. They’ve got plenty more where that came from.

Well, where else are you going to go, when you have no God, no truth, and no power, and not even any ideology, to restrain the actions of the state—which the old Prussian philosopher Hegel (trust a Prussian to come up with this) called “God walking upon the earth”? And what are the State, and Science, but just another crew of people no better, no brighter, and certainly no saner than the multitudes that they aspire to control? When there is no truth, no facts that remain facts whether you like them or not, it’s simply not possible to be rational.

But that’s what they’re pushing for, for all they’re worth.

In the battle for God’s Holy Institution of Marriage as of late there has not been a lot of encouraging news. The problem confronting us however has roots going back more than 100 years. The nose of the camel came into the tent with miscegenation laws which largely began after the War between the States. What this meant is that civil government claimed it had a rightful jurisdiction over what marriages would be legitimate and what would not.

Video of the Sermon

By the way the standard they established is not given in the Word of God where interracial marriage was never forbidden; just consider Moses and Zipporah and Boaz and Ruth and so on. So civil government was not only usurping jurisdiction over a realm of life that had not been given to it by God who ordained human civil government, they were also establishing a standard that was a contradiction against as well as a violation of God’s Law. Tragically the other two God ordained governments, family government and church government did nothing to oppose this usurpation and nothing to rebuke this law breaking act of civil government.

But there were individuals who desired to break this civil government invented law, or to use our founders verbiage, pretended legislation. When they desired to enter into a marriage with someone of a race that was forbidden the law, they would appeal to the government for a waiver of that law in the case of their upcoming marriage. And the civil magistrate often times would comply by offering them a marriage license. That is the origin of the marriage license in our land. Blacks Law dictionary defines a license as “A permission, accorded by a competent authority, conferring the right to do some act which without such authorization would be illegal,” In other words the marriage would be illegal unless a license was granted because the law claimed such a marriage was illegal to begin with. How did such a standard come then to apply to all marriages not just interracial marriages? It is a frog in the kettle story. Slowly turning up the heat bit by bit until the frog is boiled. More and more marriages were coerced into applying for marriage licenses until at this point we are led to believe that all marriages, to be legitimate, must receive a marriage license from the State.

Because the family government and church government have surrendered the ground of marriage, civil government claimed that it owned marriage entirely. Now we see the disaster that belief has led to. When government claims it owns marriage, then it claims it can redefine marriage any way it chooses. You want to marry your dog, just wait a few years, they could make that part of so-called marriage law.

What is the solution to this mess? Family government and church governments end the charade. God never gave jurisdiction over marriage to civil government. It must be taken back by family and church government. Marriage is no business of the State and therefore no marriage license is required. Family governments need to determine they will not be part of the civil government marriage charade. Don’t get a license to marry. Church government needs to do the same. As a pastor today, I will not conduct a marriage ceremony for anyone who is marrying utilizing a State issued marriage license. Family and church must take back the ground unrighteously surrendered in the past 100 years.

Along those lines there is one positive development. An Alabama Senate Committee Passed Bill last month to Eliminate Marriage Licenses in order to Nullify Federal Control over marriage.

“MONTGOMERY, Ala.(Feb. 27, 2017) – An Alabama bill that would abolish marriage licenses in the state, and effectively nullify in practice both major sides of the contentious national debate over government-sanctioned marriage, unanimously passed an important Senate committee last week.

Sen. Greg Albritton (R-Bay Minette) filed Senate Bill 20 (SB20) earlier this month. The legislation would abolish all requirements to obtain a marriage license in Alabama. Instead, probate judges would simply record civil contracts of marriage between two individuals based on signed affidavits.

‘All requirements to obtain a marriage license by the State of Alabama are hereby abolished and repealed. The requirement of a ceremony of marriage to solemnized the marriage is abolished.’”

The Alabama Senate passed a similar bill during the 2016 session, and a House committee approved it as well, but the full House did not take final action before the legislative session ended.[1]

So there is a realistic probability that Alabama will pass this law and lead the way for other States to do likewise and turn marriage back to the family government and church government where it truly belongs.

But stepping back from the details and examining the history of this problem in America one asks, what happened in our land, how did we go so far off track? The answer I believe is what happened in the pulpits of America. Because God’s Law Word was not taught, the people never rose up to resist a civil government going out of its God ordained boundaries. The people in our land were not taught from the Word of God the separate jurisdictions of the three institutions God ordained; family government, church government and civil government. They were not instructed in what the Bible establishes as the limits of the boundaries for each of the three institutions. They were not trained to recognized violations of these God ordained boundaries nor were they instructed about how Christians in our land should respond when such violations took place.

Furthermore the pastors in our land were not only failing to instruct their own congregations, they themselves ignored the clear teaching of God’s Word about what they should do when such violations occurred, they themselves failed to resist the tyranny as the Word of God commands them to do. They actually became part of the system.

Before I repented of doing weddings with State issued marriage licenses, I recall the language on the license forms I was required to fill out as the officiant at the wedding. It made me an officer of the State, with fines and penalties if I didn’t do as the State commanded me in the time frame it commanded. For me it began with being troubled by the language used at the end of the State ceremony – “by the power vested in me by the State of Maryland I now pronounce you man and wife.” What power does the State of Maryland or any other State for that matter have to make such a pronouncement? None whatsoever. The Word of God tells us that it is God Himself that takes the two and makes them “one flesh” not the State. So my first step was to drop that language.

The more I studied the more I was disturbed by all aspects of the State ceremony. I finally repented of participating in all those State ceremonies and committed to doing them no more. I realized that I had not been properly taught, I had accepted what others told me was the right way to act in this realm. It was the Word of God that led me to repentance. Paul brings this same point home in Titus 2:1.

380,https://newswithviews.com/the-message-reveals-truth-about-eugene-peterson-but-not-god/,newswithviews,“The Message” Reveals Truth About Eugene Peterson But Not God,[],"“The Message” Reveals Truth About Eugene Peterson But Not God

When the new “modernized” version of the Bible titled, The Message written by.Eugene Peterson suddenly materialized in the bookstores with lots of press attention, my own thinking was, “Here we go again. Why do we need another version of the Bible?” It was a proper question. It seemed like every other month another ‘modernized’ version of the Bible was popping up somewhere. Every new arrival would belch out the same pitch, “written in modern up to date language (many words were changed altogether missing precisely what that sentence intended to convey.)“But,” they proclaimed, “this new and changed language can be better understood.”

This new ‘Bible’ was needed, say they, since many people cannot grasp the King James Language of the original Bibles. “This is why we need a clearer up to date Bible that everyone can understand which will result in more decisions for Christ.”

When the New International Version (NIV) was birthed in the 1970’s it appeared that everyone associated with the Assemblies of God Church felt that this was the greatest new thing since corn flakes. Pastors immediately began preaching from the NIV re-written texts. The theological errors were numerous and disturbing. For example, they left out the blood of Christ. It came off like a Cliff Notes of The Bible but, the content was faulty on every other page.

I did a class one night where Scriptures were read from the King James Bible and then someone else read the same Scriptures from the NIV. Attendees began to gasp as the readings went on and the total difference in the Scriptures became so obvious that at one point it almost became scandalous as it could be seen that these NIV people had basically re-written the entire Bible, leaving out key issues.

THEN the ultimate re-written Bible of all was introduced and exploded on the scene like fireworks at an outdoor popcorn party. Notice I used “re-written,” NOT paraphrase. At one time I had 26 translations of the Bible in my library, such as The Phillips Bible and too many others to mention. These were not re-writes to change a particular meaning or word or simply edited in an attempt to clarify words. Those translations were real and absolutely valuable when seeking deeper meaning of a term used in the texts or simply to clarify a word. These were not cheap knock-offs of The Bible itself.

Peterson (we won’t refer to him as ‘Reverend since he does not have the heart of an authentic pastor) then received so much attention that he felt he had star status and could say anything he wanted. THEN the fireworks finale lit up the screens of the internet.

He began giving interviews and the trap was easily set. He was asked by the interviewer of Religious News Service if he would ever officiate at a same-sex “marriage.” He said,’yes,’ than stated that the Presbyterian Church USA performs many same-sex “marriages.” (This is very sad for this columnist who grew up in the Presbyterian Church, which at one time was THE church, where ‘proper’ God believing people attended.

Peterson often spoke in favor of LGBT people, once stating publicly, “There are gay and lesbian people who seem to have as good a spiritual life as I do.” Then he latched on to ‘situational ethics” by blubbering, “There is no right or wrong.” Really?

Wait! Isn’t he a minister? Doesn’t he have “Reverend” in front of his name? There is no way he can claim those titles when he lets it be known that he will participate in any perversion that comes along, something that God specifically prohibits. This is made clear throughout the Bible. The first chapter of Genesis tells how and why he created MAN and WOMAN who would leave their parents and cling one to another. They were to procreate. God allows for NO sexual deviancy. He made it clear that sex is only to be between a man and woman who are married. That is when sex is the most exciting.

When sex is pure it has a sacred thrill to it. Those on the prowl never know the genuine excitement that God-given sex can provide. And they remain frustrated throughout their lives since they will never know what true satisfaction is.

Of course, the moment Peterson’s perverted statements went out it started an uproar. Within 48 hours, Peterson retracted his statement. Too late, He had already exposed the secrets of his inner-being. Bookstores like Lifeway Christian Books, a huge chain, has said they will discontinue carrying his books. Other book stores have said the same.

So what do you think? Should a pastors’ books be banned from Christian book stores when they prove to be insincere, not living a biblical life, indeed exposing themselves as hypocrites?

Here is the answer from this writer: I have a great respect for books and for authors, even authors I disagree with, such as many philosophers I read who are atheists. They are writing their thoughts sincerely. I am intrigued how the thought process of scholars function as they analyze a social issue and work toward a conclusion. I am fascinated by epistemology directing scholars to reach their final thoughts.

I also know what goes into a book. It is an endeavor where the author pours his very being into the book, revealing his deepest thinking process that leads to his breakthrough ideas.

HOWEVER it is an entirely different matter when someone claiming to be a minister and theologian is actually a hypocrite who uses words, not from the heart, but words he has picked out of the air to make a book that will appeal to believers. When I read a Christian book I want to read words that are pure, that come out of a pure heart, not from a deceptive heart that defies the wishes of God.

Yes, the Christian book stores should not carry his books. This is rare for me since I love my library. However, I’ve already gotten rid of my own copy of The Message. None of Peterson’s books will be in my library again. If I had the space available I would fill several pages of “Scriptures” as written and given to the world by Eugene Peterson so you can see for yourselves. And to think I have seen respectable pastors preaching their sermons from that abominable Bible re-write, not the Bible itself.

Quick Question: Why do Christians think that we have to constantly make new versions of the Bible? Ask yourselves this question. Have the Muslims ever re-written their so-called sacred texts? Can you imagine them ever doing so? The original Bible should be what is on the pulpit, which is what first came to us and will never be out of date.

Am I being too judgmental and harsh for the feelings I have about a pastor committing or endorsing sin? No. We must confront sin and uphold God and His Word. And what about the criticism of us calling some sins more serious than others, like homosexuality?

There are many sins. However, this column has never heard of a thief, a robber, an adulterer, a murderer, a child molester or rapist mounting a campaign to force everyone to accept those sins. I have not heard of those other sinners putting people in jail for refusing to endorse and participate in those sins by attending their events or parades. We have never heard of other sinners putting people in jail for refusing to endorse those sins by providing them professional services.

Homosexuality is a completely different category of sin. It affects everyone. It affects children (who should be allowed to grow up without exposure to deviancy in their formative years. We are guilty for allowing this to happen.

PASTORS, MAN YOUR PULPITS. Christians, let’s get rid of these phony pastors like Eugene Peterson who are not only illegitimate but are hypocrites. More people leave the church and even a relationship with Jesus Christ because of these bogus preachers than any other single reason.

And each of those arrogant frauds will have to stand before the White Throne Judgment. Read Ezekiel 3. This tells how anyone you turn away from God by your actions and personal conduct will require their blood on your hands. You will be held totally responsible. This is a serious offense that will be punished severely, especially those pastors and ‘reverends’ who falsely use those titles.

Mr. Peterson has a unique take on the Bible. He believes that we are to love the sinner…AND…love the sin. He may as well create The Church of Evasion..Perhaps he already has. We don’t really believe that God had that in mind.

There are only two choices to make in life: Do it God’s way–or don’t do it at all. This is what gives validity to the titles of ‘Reverend” and or Pastor..The preacher who does not do it God’s way is a con-man who has no right to refer to himself as a Reverend or a Pastor.

Get involved with a Bible believing church and join a Bible study class. Fill yourselves totally with God. Our relationship with God is what will be our strength and guide us in these coming last days.

And please, readers, show this story to every pastor you know. It is time to hold the microscope up to ourselves.

Josephine County , OR. —Democracy only functions when citizens have sufficient information about their government. Yet knowing what is going on in the government is far easier said than done. Even informed citizens who try hard to get an accurate picture might only manage to get a fraction of the whole story. Plus, many information sources such as television, newspapers, radio, the internet, social media and word of mouth are pushing a political agenda.

When it comes to your county government, there is far more to the story than just politics. Here are a few examples of things that your county government has done in the last few months. Whether or not you feel this information is important, chances are after reading it you will know more about your county government than someone who only pays attention to controversial topics.

Animal Protection:

Your county government runs the Animal Protection program. This includes officers who enforce laws regarding animal safety. The county also administers the animal shelter which cares for and adopts out stray, neglected or abused animals. In 2014 the voters approved a levy to pay for the program. A short video about how your county government is spending that money is located here.

Animal Control Officers are not limited to working on cases that will lead to prosecution. The November 18, 2015 edition of The Daily Courier reported on how a black lab became dangerously tangled in blackberries next to a 15-foot vertical drop above an irrigation canal. The distraught owner called Animal Protection, which quickly sent an officer. The officer assembled a harness and helped pull the dog to safety. Due to the officer’s action, the dog was unharmed.

Also, last month (December, 2015) the County cut adoption fees in half for cats and dogs aged seven years or more in an effort to encourage people to adopt older animals. And military veterans now get a 50% discount when they adopt animals who need a home.

Stepping Up Initiative:

America’s criminal justice system is poorly equipped to handle offenders with acute mental illnesses. Many people wind up in jail not because they knowingly set out to commit a crime, but rather because something in their brain is physically imbalanced and they have sincerely lost touch with reality. Of course, the government needs to protect the community from all violent offenders. But most of the non-violent mental illness sufferers are dangerous principally to themselves. They are also dangerous to the public treasury. Let there be no doubt: inmates with acute mental illnesses such as schizophrenia are the most expensive kind. Even worse, you get the least return for your tax dollars because they are beyond traditional rehabilitation.

In December, 2015, your county joined hundreds of other counties across the state and nation in the Stepping Up Initiative. The project is designed to coordinate governmental efforts with those of private citizens and organizations who work on treating persons who suffer from acute mental illness. The specific aim is to keep such affected citizens on their meds and out of county jails. Locally the program is being led by the Circuit Court judge who oversees the Mental Health Court. The cost to the county is zero, but the savings over time could potentially be great, and the project could free up some needed jail beds.

Fire Suppression:

When the forest catches on fire – which happens often these days – your county is essential to the fire suppression effort. Interestingly, Josephine County is the only county in Oregon which owns and operates two airports. Firefighting helicopters use the Grants Pass and Illinois Valley Airports as a base for their operations. Your county has been providing this service to firefighters for many decades.

Currently, the county is negotiating with the U.S. Forest Service about building better helipads at each airport. The newer helipads would improve the Forest Service’s ability to fight dangerous wildfires. To stay updated on the latest developments surrounding this project, go to an Airport Advisory Board meeting. They occur monthly in the evenings and are open to the public.

Scandal sells, but responsible citizenship requires learning about the “rest of the story.” Feel good that you have done some of that today.

The MacLaren Nightmare

What would you think about a four-year-old child who, when you wanted to take them to a relative’s home, became so agitated in not wanting to go, and so visibly scared that they wet themselves? Would you think there was a real problem; perhaps a dangerous problem? Or, would your first inclination be that the child must have been coached? Unfortunately, for one child and her mother that is exactly the position Department of Human Services (DHS) employee Cori McGovern has taken by asserting the mother introduced the ideas into her own child. By taking this position, DHS has taken the child from her mother and placed her with the girl’s father, the exact person the girl so vehemently acted out against being around. It begs the question, how is it that some abused children get lost in the system that is supposed to protect them and wind up being more damaged? One thing is certain, that is exactly what has happened in this nightmare of a case.

According to records, In the Spring of 2015, Christi MacLaren was initially told by her daughter (then four-years-old) that Sean Lenzo (biological father) had rubbed, “magic cream” on her vagina in a really fast motion until bleeding occurred. Next, the young girl claimed Lenzo took a picture of her vagina while it was bleeding, eventually showing her the photo as he laughed. In shock, Christi immediately contacted several professionals that very day. Her main concern was her daughter’s safety and seeking help. Unfortunately, there was no help for Christi and her daughter, only horrific damage according to mulitple witnesses.

“Cori McGovern (DHS) has previously been successfully sued for placing a young girl in the hands of child molesters” — Witness

Lenzo isn’t the only one with a dark history. The caseworker herself, Cori McGovern, has previously been sued and found liable for placing a young girl in the hands of child molesters, resulting in the young child be raped, repeatedly. According to one Attorney who represented one of McGovern’s victims, “DHS settled his client’s case for a large sum of money.” Instead of being fired for placing the child with rapists, and previous actions, DHS simply transferred McGovern to another office in a nearby town. Today, McGovern is doing the exact same thing to another young girl, Christi’s daughter.

Temporary Visitation

Gabriel and Christi with their other daughter

On December 19, 2016 Christi MacLaren, along with her husband Gabriel, and her parents attended a hearing before Jackson County Circuit Court Judge Ronald Grensky regarding Christi’s now six-year-old daughter. The hearing was set because the biological father, Sean Lenzo, refused to adhere to a previous order, and prevented the grandparents from seeing the child. Lenzo also claimed Gabriel was a danger to the young girl. Without any factual evidence or witnesses, Lenzo alleged Gabriel abused Christi.

All the facts and evidence are contrary to Lenzo’s desperate attempts to smear Gabriel. In fact, 38-year-old Gabriel has no criminal convictions EVER, nor any record of domestic abuse whatsoever. Gabriel was a youth group counselor at his church, and has previously worked with the Oregon Youth Authority requiring extensive background checks to be passed before he could be around children. After hearing Lenzo’s unsupported story full of vague details, Judge Grensky sided with Christi, her parents and Gabriel, rightfully allowing visits until the trial date to establish custody is over.

Case History

Sean Lenzo Sean Lenzo

“I don’t want to be with him!” — Daughter

Signs of sexual abuse were witnessed by several people; one being a pre-school principal who stated she heard the young child scream, “I don’t want to be with him” (Lenzo) as the little girl urinated on herself. Claims of self harming by the young girl were also investigated and confirmed by people other than the mother. According to many professionals, these actions are severe symptoms of sexual abuse.

“I recommend all contact (daughter and father) stop immediately, including supervised visits.” –Victoria Bones, Licensed Clinincal Social Worker

Another professional, Victoria Bones, a court appointed expert licensed clinical social worker found that, “It is highly unlikely that the child could react the way she does so consistently and repeatedly” if she had been coached. Bones continued, “I recommend all contact (daughter and Lenzo) stop immediately, including supervised visits.” Bones finished by saying, “to force (child) to continue to have contact with her father is re-traumatizing her in my opinion.” Bones met several times with the young girl. Judge Grensky has never heard this evidence due to the actions of DHS forcing a settlement without a trial.

“Christi MacLaren is a 40-year-old, bright, well educated, married, mother of two who displays no evidence of a mental defect.” –Dr. Jerry Larson M.D. Psychiatrist

Another professional, Dr. Jerry Larson M.D. Psychiatrist stated, “Christi MacLaren is a 40-year-old, bright, well educated, married, mother of two who displays no evidence of a mental defect.” Dr. Larson continued, “I find the DHS (Cori McGovern) action puzzling at best.”

Other experts found disgusting examples of abuse by Sean Lenzo, to put it mildly. Some of the reports are too intense to describe, yet McGovern didn’t only disbelieve Christi, she has essentially not believed any of the experts – professionals who are highly educated and have the ability to diagnose, whereas McGovern does not.

At the hearing on Dec. 19th, Attorneys for both parties began litigating intently. Judge Grensky showed a deep concern to want this case resolved – fast. After previously stating he did not want to hear expert witness testimony, and that he wanted the parents to “work things out”, Grensky did an abrupt 180 degree turn from his previous actions in the case. Thankfully he finally took this case as serious as he should have nearly eight months ago.

Lenzo’s attorney, Jamie Hazlett began questioning Gabriel, the step-father, drilling him over and over again, unnecessarily. Judge Grensky stepped in and stated, “Ms. Hazlett I’m going to be frank with you. Why is that every time we have a problem with a judgment you’re on one end of it. Why is that? I don’t understand, but it’s always you.” Hazlett responded, “Alright well that may be your take on it…” Judge Grensky replied, “It is my take on it.”

Cori McGovern (DHS)

After DHS caseworker Cori McGovern got on the witness stand, Judge Grensky stated to her, “let me be succinct… Now that it looks like that (daughter being kept from mother) may go down the drain, you’re not so happy anymore. That’s the bottom line, right?

McGovern responded, “It is our (DHS) belief that [the daughter’s] behaviors were caused by mother.” McGovern continued, “That she (Christi) influenced, that she coached the child and that (child’s) behaviors – the self harming, the unrealistic fear of her father, that those were being driven by her mother.”

Basically, McGovern said that if Christi sees her daughter unsupervised, that DHS will take custody of the young girl and put her in foster care. Remember, several professionals who have the ability to diagnose, disagree with McGovern and DHS. These are experts that have not been able to testify in front of Judge Grensky. Considering this line of questioning by the Judge, it appears that he has finally taken a keen interest in what should rightfully be done.

“…A review was held and it was decided that there is not reasonable cause to believe that you (Christi) are responsible for the mental injury of (your daughter).” –DHS

How can McGovern declare that the mother is the cause of abuse when McGovern’s own superiors issued a letter dated Sept. 23, 2016 that read in part, “…A review was held and it was decided that there is not reasonable cause to believe that you (Christi) are responsible for the mental injury of (your daughter).” Furthermore, once the letter was written, how is it that McGovern could continue to make these claims against Christi? Is there no chain of command at DHS? Or, do caseworkers get to do anything they want without accountability?

According to McGovern herself, the case DHS had against Christi was closed in April of 2016, five months before her superiors took action at the request of Christi’s attorney Samantha Malloy. So, the question remains, how can McGovern be allowed to testify under oath that Christi is an abuser while McGovern’s own superior, Greg Thomas from Salem, OR., states there is no proof Christi caused abuse?

Christi MacLaren

Christi MacLaren had already taken one mental health evaluation which she passed, but DHS’ Cori McGovern wasn’t willing to accept that report. Instead, McGovern, along with Lenzo’s attorney Jamie Hazlett, pushed for a court order to force Christi to choose one of two “DHS approved” mental health evaluators. Christi, at the advice of her attorney, chose Dr. O’Connell – the doctor DHS wanted. Christi had no funds to pay for the mental health evaluation as she had been fired from her previous place of employment because of the false “founded abuse” report that Cori McGovern had previously made. Christi’s employer was forced to fire her due to insurance liability, preventing Christi from having an income and leaving her scraping to get by with the bare essentials. Eventually, Christi was able save enough to pay for the $1,400.00 exam that took several days to complete. The report from Dr. O’Connell was finally produced just before the Dec. 19th hearing. The result: Christi is a satisfactory parent.

Although Christi has now passed two mental health evaluations, DHS’ Cori McGovern was still not satisfied, claiming on the witness stand that she hadn’t seen it yet, insinuating that she would not accept it because she wasn’t able to talk with the doctor even though the court had already agreed that any communication from anyone regarding the exam would have to be done in writing, as part of the record. Cori McGovern apparently didn’t want to communicate on the record. Did McGovern want to pressure the doctor to give a fraudulent report that bolstered an ill conceived agenda?

Sean Lenzo

Furthermore, Christi has no criminal record while the biological father reportedly has an extensive one, including three felonies. According to one witness, two of the felonies were dismissed through a plea deal, and another felony conviction in California simply just disappeared. Could DHS have a hand in that? Although the felonies may be gone, his acknowledgement of them is not. Lenzo confirmed his drug abuse history during a deposition. According to Lenzo’s Facebook page, he now has a gun which has caused much more fear for Christi and her family. Christi had a previous restraining order against Lenzo because he threatened harm to her and her parents.

“If Sean Lenzo has been convicted of felony drug charges, it would be next to impossible for him to ever possess a firearm.” –Law Enforcement Officer

One law enforcement professional stated that, “If Sean Lenzo has been convicted of felony drug charges, it would be next to impossible for him to ever possess a firearm.” Unfortunately, that doesn’t appear to be the case in this instance.

Backing up to the May 19th hearing, Judge Grensky stated to Christi, after not allowing expert testimony, “All of this is going to be on you (Christi). We’re not gonna be sitting there monitoring every single step of the way.” The Judge ended his statement by saying, “I don’t tell DHS what to do.” Although the Judge’s tone at the recent hearing purportedly leads one to believe he is finally doing the right thing, his prior statement that he doesn’t tell DHS what to do is what has terrified Christi MacLaren beyond belief. She’s concerned that the Judge’s power is not enough to protect her, or her daughter because of the continuous threats by DHS. It’s all been but guaranteed according to McGovern that DHS will take her daughter again if the Judge rightfully gives her custody.

A trial to determine custody of Christi and Lenzo’s daughter is scheduled for January 11-12, 2017 at the Jackson County Courthouse.Christi has spent approximately $37,000.00 in the past two years attempting to protect her daughter. If you can support Christi, we humbly ask that you donate to her GoFundMe account. Attorney bills are piling high and every cent contributed will be graciously appreciated.

Again, please give even the smallest amount. Christi’s family is in desperate need.

UPDATE: On the evening of December 21st, 2016 the US~Observer received a call from a blocked number. The caller asked, “Why are you pushing on Cori McGovern?” When asked to identify himself the caller stated, “It doesn’t matter.” The caller was told that we wouldn’t talk to him unless he identified himself to which he responded, “Okay, I’ll have to come see you in person, if that’s the way you want it.”

It appears Cori McGovern doesn’t just like to throw her weight around in cases where children are involved. It is more likely than not that she had this “stranger” call to try to intimidate us. We will not be intimidated, and it just made our resolve even greater.

By NWV Senior Political News Writer, Jim Kouri

“Revealed: ‘Ordinary ‘citizen’ John McCain dispatched a trusted aide across the Atlantic to [obtain] dirty dossier from ex-spy after former British diplomat told him about blackmail tapes….”

Sen. John McCain said he did “what any citizen would do” in turning over to the FBI a so- called dirty dossier, that allegedly contained unconfirmed secrets about president-elect Donald Trump, over to the FBI. The Arizona Senior Senator has gained a reputation as a “reasonable conservative” but his critics say he is “neither reasonable nor is he a conservative.”

“If you look up the political term RINO in a dictionary it should carry a picture of McCain with the definition ‘Republican In Name Only,'” said police adviser for the National Law

Enforcement Legal Defense Society, Charles Coultner.

A former intelligence officer told NewswithViews.com that the left-leaning British newspaper, The Guardian, described how the dossier came to be and how McCain got his hands on the super-secret documents.

“I first heard about this mysterious dossier when I was checking out an Inside the Beltway private detective and security firm. The firm allegedly tapped Trump‘s campaign staff and his allies hoping to find negative ammunition against the true Republican Maverick, Donald Trump,” said former military intelligence operative and New York police detective Michael Snopes.

“I know… I know… Senator John McCain is the guy the Democrats love to use to slam the GOP because most of the time he has cooperated with the Democrats, especially now,” said Iris Aquino, a former police official and now a director of security for a major corporation.

Shortly after the election — that left Donald Trump the winner and Hillary Clinton the loser — John McCain attended a Canadian conference and spoke with a ‘former senior western diplomat’ who knew of the dossier’s existence, claims the United Kingdom’s Daily Mail.

Sir Andrew Wood described to reporters his dealings with McCain: “I would like to stress that I did not pass on any dossier to Senator McCain or anyone else and I did not see a dossier at the time.” However, it’s what Wood did not say that was interesting: He didn’t deny telling McCain about the dirty dossier.

On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal exposed the ex-spy who actually obtained the documents as being British subject, Christopher Steele.

Steele’s spy agency discovered a Democratic Party insider who wanted dirt on the now Republican nominee instead.

The unnamed contractor was later identified by the Wall Street Journal as being Christopher Steele. He and another ex-British diplomat, Christopher Burrows, run their own company, Orbis Business Intelligence.

384,https://newswithviews.com/restoring-what-it-means-to-be-an-american/,newswithviews,Restoring What It Means To Be An American,[],"Even though I am black, I was raised on Superman’s; truth, justice and the American way. I always believed Americans were the world’s good guys. As a kid, I watched my mom cry over “I Love Lucy” TV stars Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz getting a divorce.

I remember our entire family, mom, dad and five kids gathered around our single television; nail-biting tension in the air as we nervously awaited the final out for our Baltimore Orioles to win the World’s Series over the Pittsburgh Pirates. Despite our country’s racial issues, we patriotically embraced the distinct American culture. We were Americans.

When President JFK said, “Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country”, I believe a majority of Americans agreed with him.

For years, I sang my song, “Celebrate America at Naturalization Oath of Allegiance Ceremonies. I thought it was pretty cool that mine was the first song new Americans heard after taking their oath of allegiance. I witnessed thousands of immigrants who jumped through all the hoops, learned our language and history and tearfully pledged their allegiance.

I still remember a gentleman who appeared to be in his 90s, raised to his feet from a wheelchair by a grandchild on each arm. Their entire family wept as he took his oath. Clearly, it meant something extremely special to become an American.

It pained me deeply watching Obama lower the bar, redefining and dumbing down what it means to be an American.

Obama rolled out the red carpet welcoming tens of thousands of illegals to invade our country for welfare benefits; even benefits unavailable to American citizens. For immigrants legally becoming new citizens, Obama made pledging to defend our county optional.

Assuming Hillary would win the WH, Obama figured his illegal invaders would eventually be gifted voting rights. It did not matter to Obama that they had no desire to embrace our culture, respect our flag or learn to speak English. In essence, Obama took the majestic shine off of becoming an American.

The late queen of cosmetics, Mary Kay Ash said the speed of the leader is the speed of the gang. Unarguably, Obama’s disdain and disrespect for Americanism trickled down infecting our country. Public schools banned the singing of “God Bless the USA/Proud to be an America“. Students were barred from wearing t-shirts to school featuring the U.S. flag on Cinco De Mayo, claiming it was hateful and insensitive to illegal Mexican students. Multimillionaire pro athletes refused to stand for our national anthem, proclaiming themselves victims of America. Their example of dissing our flag trickled down to high and middle school athletes across America.

Under Obama, JFK’s words inspiring Americans to strive for excellence for the good of their country were thrown on the junk-heap of forgotten history. Obama’s new Americanism was about demonizing and punishing self-reliant achievers, pandering to lazy parasites and addicting as many Americans as possible to big government dependency.

Due to decades of our Leftist controlled public schools abandoning teaching U.S. history, far too many Americans quickly surrendered their precious God-given and fought for freedom and liberty for a free Obama phone and his promise to Robin Hood the rich. Ben Franklin said, “Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.”

Obama actually launched an ad campaign begging illegals to apply for food stamps.

Using a Hispanic soap opera , Obama told illegals that applying for as many U.S. government freebie programs as possible was the honorable thing to do for their families. http://bit.ly/2tH14AA

It was also painful watching Obama insidiously divide Americans into supposed victimized voting blocs; blacks, Hispanics, women, transgenders and so on. Suddenly, we became an entitlement-minded gimme-society; everyone running around claiming America abused them and therefore owed them a living.

I kept thinking what the heck is going on. We are better than this. I wanted to scream from the roof tops, “This is not who we are. Darn it, we are AMERICANS!!!” In my song, “We Are Americans“, I ask my fellow Americans to repent and return to our founding principles.

I was pleasantly surprised to learn that Mark Levin recently penned a book in which he brilliantly articulated the source of my heartache for my country; the well-orchestrated cultural and moral decline of America.

Levin’s book is titled, “Rediscovering Americanism And The Tyranny of Progressivism”

The good news is Trump winning the WH in an electoral landslide proves that despite decades of Leftists trying to convince Americans that we are the greatest source of evil in the world, the masses still love our country and long to see her made great again.

And for that, I am extremely hopeful and grateful. Prayerfully, Trump will usher in us becoming Americans again.

What happens when the law makers themselves become law breakers? Or what happens when those who are charged with enforcing the law also become law breakers themselves? In an police incident in our State’s Capital this past Christmas, a man was arrested by the police and $1500 cash was taken from him by the police but never returned. Just last month it appears that because a lawsuit was looming that city finally cut him a check for that amount but the incident is another very troubling example of civil asset forfeiture. That “involves a dispute between law enforcement and property such as a pile of cash or a house or a boat, such that the thing is suspected of being involved in a crime. To get back the seized property, owners must prove it was not involved in criminal activity.”[1] In other words you are not charged with a crime, you money is and it is guilty until proven innocent – a costly and statistically losing battle for the person who has been civil asset forfeitured by the police. I am glad Annapolis finally did the right thing, but that is rare in the civil asset forfeiture world. By the way the city still can’t account for what happened to the $1500. Was it get pocketed? The officer said he put it in his hat, but after that no one knows what became of it. And by the way he has since retired, and faced no repercussions for his actions.

Video of the sermon

What about lawlessness on the Federal level? We know that for more than a decade the immigration laws which clearly spell out the enforcement the executive branch is charged to conduct – have not only been ignored, with little enforcement taking place, but in fact the previous administration made active moves to encourage more illegal immigration into our country. The effect has been to tell the world we have open boarders, anyone who wants to can walk right in. Our immigration laws mean nothing. And now when we have the Executive branch trying to enforce the immigration laws on the books, Federal courts have repeatedly blocked the enforcement from going into effect.

We also know “There is a federal law that forbids the Internal Revenue Service from unfairly targeting private groups or individuals on the basis of their politics. Lois Lerner, an IRS director, did just that but faced no legal consequences.

Perhaps Ms. Lerner’s exemption emboldened New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof to invite IRS employees via social media to unlawfully leak Donald Trump’s tax returns. Later, someone leaked Mr. Trump’s 2005 tax return to MSNBC.

There are statutes that prevent federal intelligence and investigatory agencies from leaking classified documents. No matter.… The leakers apparently feel that prosecutors and the courts do not mind if someone’s privacy is illegally violated, as long as it is the privacy of someone they all loathe, like Mr. Trump.

The logic seems also to be that we need only follow the laws that we like — and assume that law enforcement must make the necessary adjustments.”[2]

What is the cumulative effect of these trends?

With selective enforcement and government officials who are clearly above the law, what does that lead people to conclude? That law in America is arbitrary, politically protected individuals and groups are exempt, you never know when you will be robbed by the police or falsely imprisoned. Does not this begin to sound very much like a description of the communist USSR, where the civil government rather than protecting and defending your God given rights became the primary violator of your God given rights?

Are we as a nation descending into lawlessness or has lawlessness already been enthroned as the ruler of these united States?

Consider that our Founders clearly stated their understanding of what law is which they styled, “The Laws of Nature and Nature’s God.” And we have previously shown from this pulpit that this phrase clearly referred to the Bible. So they believed God’s Law given to us in the Bible is the Supreme Law of the Universe and any human statute must comply with that Supreme Law to be valid law.

Then think what has happened since that time, at first slow steady descent, but in the past fifty years a precipitous free fall in rejecting God’s Law as supreme has taken place. So what has become of that Supreme Law in the eyes of the legal scribblers of our land? It has been rejected entirely.

For me the most telling scene was in 2003 on a hot August morning in Montgomery Alabama where I saw the workers inside the Judicial building moving the Ten Commandments, a monument to lawful government from the center of the rotunda. In the crowd there was a rumor circulating that they were going to put it on a trailer and haul it away. Some of us went around to the loading dock to see if this is was so. It was not, instead they parked the Ten Commandments in a closet and locked the door. What a fitting image of what has happened to the rule of law in our land. The Law of the Creator taken out of a public building devoted supposedly to the rule of law, and locked away in a closet. That reminds us of the very first of the Ten Commandments, Exodus 20:3 “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.” The god whom a society chooses to worship will be the god that determines its “laws.” So having dethroned the rightful ruler, the Creator God Himself, what has been put up instead? Lawlessness. We see government lawlessness where the ruling class has a different set of standards and laws for them than for the rest of the peons. And we see where those so called rules are selective enforced against the politically unfavored. Where a police man can steal $1500 from a motorist and face no consequences for it. Where we have seen leftist mobs viciously assault citizens while the police stand by and let the violence go on. By dethroning the Supreme Law of the Universe what has replaced it? Lawlessness. Lawlessness in the corridors of Congress, lawlessness in the camber of the Supreme Court, lawlessness throughout civil government on all levels. But it isn’t confined there, were to God that it was, we have lawlessness breaking the peace of our society, from gangs not only in the cities but now frequently in the suburbs, to leftist mobs violently attacking anyone who disagrees with them. What will it take to restore this land of liberty?

386,https://newswithviews.com/did-trump-really-win-the-election/,newswithviews,Did Trump really win the election?,[],"Did Trump really win the election?

Hillary won the popular vote—Trump won the Electoral Vote—or did he?

Dec 19th the Presidential Electors cast their votes—Jan 6th we’ll know who captured the White House—or will the House of Representatives decide?

It seems pretty cut and dried that Trump captured the White House. Usually the Presidential Electors are a meaningless “rubber-stamp” weeks after the popular vote winner in each State is declared. However, this year the complaining, protesting, rabble-rousing, turmoil and battle continue—to defeat Trump.

The Presidential Electors have been bombarded with continual email, snail mail, petitions, and phone calls to persuade them to vote for anyone but Trump. The goal is to reduce the Electoral votes below 270, and let the House of Representatives make the choice.

How did our presidential election process deteriorate to become so loathsome and degenerate? Three main reasons: political parties, campaigning and popular vote.

Why do we assume the loudest Huckster makes the best President?

The Framers intelligently created a constitutional federation—not a democracy. We describe the structure as a complex constitutional representative republic.

The Framers of the Constitution very carefully outlined in Article II, the procedure for electing a President for the United States. Nowhere in the Constitution does it authorize: political parties at all (let alone taking over the election process), office seekers campaigning across the nation, or popular vote by the people—mass democracy.

Nothing seems to be more misunderstood than the reasons why the Framers outlined in the Constitution, the use of Presidential Electors in the process of electing a President for the United States. It is known as the Electoral College.

There have been many recent articles defending the Electoral College and many articles demanding we eliminate the Electoral College by going to a national popular vote. Tragically, the genius of the purpose and benefits of the system, outlined in the original Constitution is totally unknown today. Even the articles coming to the defense of the Electoral College, are missing the most important points.

The Presidential Electors were not designed as an “after-thought” to be merely a “rubber-stamp” after years of campaigning—self-aggrandizing office seekers, boasting their qualifications, while trying to cover-up their criminal actives and minimizing their own misdeeds; while tearing their opponents to shreds. The constitutional election process was designed to avoid political campaigning across the nation, party primaries, state and national conventions, office seekers running on promises which are usually legislative issues, not their prerogative at all, as an Executive. Candidates promise people so called entitlements, buy votes with bribes, and take millions from special interests on their way to capture the White House. The best salesman wins the war. Or as I asked earlier, “Is the loudest Huckster the best President?”

The Framers designed an ingenious system which was the opposite of all of this. As I mentioned, it was designed to avoid all campaigning, rabble rousing, tumult and disorder because the Office of the President was not elected by the people! He was not the “King of the people.”

The Framers had discussed many options for selecting a President, and they rejected the idea of a popular vote for President. The one and only national office to be elected by the people was member of the House of Representatives.

Here is one of the critical missing facts in every discussion: Every national level office was outlined to be elected using a different method, by a different group of people, representing different (and sometimes conflicting) interests. Each position was to serve a different term in office and was given different enumerated responsibilities. Each office was to represent a different interest and check other offices from usurping delegated prerogatives. (Party politics only represents the party interests at every level.) Each position outlined by the Constitution was designed for thinkers and statesmen at every level.

The method for electing the President was described in detail in Article II of the Constitution. The ingenious system designated the Electors as the first step in the process. The Electors were the “forethought” not the rubber-stamp “afterthought”.

The Presidential Electors in every State had a very important assignment. This group of carefully selected intelligent individuals, chosen in whatever manner their State Legislature decided, would meet in their individual states on the same day across the nation. Each independent Elector was to recommend two outstanding individuals who could be presidential possibilities. Nominate two (not campaign for one) who they thought would best represent the interest of the Nation and carry out the will of Congress as the Chief Executive. Their recommendations would be based on past performance and service to their state or to the nation—not campaign promises.

The President’s responsibility was not to appeal to the will of the people—he was not the “King of the People.” The President was the chief Executive of the Union of the States.

The list of names recommended by the independent Electors in each State with the number for votes for each, were then signed, sealed, certified and submitted to the Seat of Government. The lists would be opened in joint secession of Congress. The process of opening and tallying the Electors’ nominations determined who the candidates would be. The 5 most recommended individuals by the Electors were the candidates submitted to the House of Representatives for election by the States. The Representatives from each State formed a delegation which had one vote. The Vice-president was to come from this same pool of outstanding statesmen.

This system for electing a President is so ingenious, because one group outside of government control and influence—the Electors, representing the people of the various States, would make the recommendations, and another group which was part of government, the peoples’ House of Representatives, would make the final election, as equal states.

The Framers outlined and established a “Constitutional Federation”, not a democracy. This was a truly ingenious structure of government. They created a “more perfect union,” established justice, safeguarded freedom, individual liberty and prosperity.

We claim that constitutional government was destroyed by party government. The first branch to fall was the Executive Branch. The hastily written and ratified 12th Amendment was a result of party machinations usurping the assignment of the independent Electors to recommend outstanding presidential possibilities. Parties encouraged political campaigning, running for office and led the country from a constitutional federation to mass democracy.

“You must move in the arteries of the system without anyone noticing your existence until you reach all the power centers … until the conditions are ripe, they [the followers] must continue like this … The time is not yet right. You must wait for the time when you are complete and conditions are ripe.” —Fethullah Gülen June 1999

LTG Michael T. Flynn, our former NSA Chief, hoped to rid the country of Fethullah Gulen, and for good reason, the protection of American citizenry and especially of our children.

Fethullah Gulen

So, who is Gulen? Why are American tax dollars funding his charter schools with no school board oversight? Why is he allowed to bring thousands of Turkish Muslims into America via H1-B Visas, promoted heavily by the likes of Senator Mike Lee and others in Congress? Why are his charter schools on our Air Force bases? And what is the connection of Gulen to the CIA?

The leader of the Gulen Charter schools has been hiding in the Pocono Mountains since 1999. The CIA will tell you he came here for “health reasons” but in truth he ran from his government and went into exile when he was accused of attempting to undermine Turkey’s secular regime in order to institute an Islamic state. He obtained his long time visa with the help of former CIA officials.

Sibel Edmonds explains how Gulen was brought into the United States during the Clinton Administration, and how Bill Clinton’s White House, the State Department and the Justice Department’s Janet Reno provided the infamous mullah and his terrorism-heroin operations with blanket immunity and protection. Clinton’s hand-picked handlers, Graham Fuller and Mark Grossman, were selected to manage and direct Gulen’s cells in the U.S. and abroad. Link

Gülen is a Turkish imam who started a worldwide network of charter schools to teach the principles of Islam. His massive wealth is estimated to be between $22-50 billion. In building a sophisticated and well-funded worldwide network, including a substantial presence here in America, Gulen is following in the footsteps and exhortations of Mohammed, who counseled patience and deception (Taqiyya) as a means of overcoming the infidel when the power of the infidel was greater than the power of the umma, (the Muslim community). This is called “Civilization Jihad,” and is more sinister and dangerous than the frontal assault strategy of al Qaeda and Hamas.

However, Fethullah Gulen, has also made radical remarks encouraging Muslims to destroy “infidels.” His call for taking violent action against non-Muslims can be traced to the voice recording of a sermon which he preached in the 1980s.

Our Taxes Fund Gulen Charters

Gulen is educating more than 35,000 students in nearly 200 publicly funded schools, and makes up the largest charter school network in the United States. They promote an Islamic agenda, but receive government money, unlike other religious schools in the United States. These are the schools that are part of what is called Fethullah Gülen Community (FGC), also known as “the Gülen Movement.”

The U.S. Gülen schools receive public, state, and federal funds, but there is no oversight by the local school board. The Gulen charters are the 2nd largest charter chain in the US, second only to the rotten KIPP charters. The Gulen charters have been raided by the FBI many times. American news organizations have done little to inform the public about the Gülen Movement, its schools, or any deeper significance or associated controversies. To date, only one news story has been produced by the mainstream press, USA Today’s, “Objectives of charter schools with Turkish connections questioned,” and it is rather weak.

Here is a list of Gulen charter schools, albeit it is from last year, but notice the variety of names for these charters. The innocuous names like Chicago Math and Science Academy and Pioneer Charter School of Science, don’t inform the community that they’re run by an Islamic Mullah.

Gulen and H1B Visas

Gülen schools are among the nation’s largest users of the H1B visas. In 2009, the schools received government approvals for 684 visas – more than Google Inc. (440) but fewer than a technology powerhouse such as Intel Corp. (1,203), reported the Philadelphia Inquirer. However, they may be facing harder times in the future.

Over the past 10 years, the schools have imported thousands of Turkish educators to work in the schools, most of them with ties to Gülen, who lives in a small Pennsylvania town called Saylorsburg. The charters receive approximately $150 million a year in tax breaks and subsidies. Government officials are increasingly concerned that taxpayer dollars are being used to fund a close-knit network of Turkish teachers and businesses using charter schools as a Trojan horse for embedding into the U.S. education system.

These so-called Turkish teachers who speak very little English and who have no teaching experience, come to America and teach for a bit and then disappear into American society. It is inconceivable that our visa officers have approved thousands of visas for English teachers whose English is incomprehensible. There are over 5,000 Turkish employees on H1B Visas. And, unbelievably, the Gülen organization illegally threatens to revoke these visas unless the Turkish teachers agree to kick back part of their salary to the organization.

Gulen Charters on US Air Force Bases

Countries all over the world are forcing Gulen schools out because of his statements and ideology, but Americans are allowing his Islamic schools on our Air Force bases. One has to wonder why. Is it because these bases contain our fighter jets?

General Flynn said, “We are facing another ‘ism,’ just like we faced Nazism, and fascism, and imperialism and communism. This is Islamism, it is a vicious cancer inside the body of 1.7 billion people on this planet and it has to be excised.”

Lawyer Robert R. Amsterdam, founder of international law firm, Amsterdam and Partners LLP, has been engaged by the Republic of Turkey (Erdogan)…to conduct a wide ranging investigation into the operations and geopolitical influence of the Gülen organization, which is behind the Coral Academy of Science and over 140 other public charter schools scattered across 26 American states.”

The Coral Academy of Science in Las Vegas has a Gulen charter on the Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas. Amsterdam says his firm’s investigation revealed that the Gülen organization “uses charter schools and affiliated businesses in the U.S. to misappropriate and launder state and federal education dollars, which the organization then uses for its own benefit to develop political power in this country and globally.”

Nellis AFB is a US military installation with military schools and more squadrons than any other USAF base, and hosts air combat exercises such as Exercise Red Flag and close air support exercises such as Green Flag-West flown in “Military Operations Area (MOA) airspace.” They are associated with the nearby Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR). The base also has the Combined Air and Space Operations Center-Nellis. One wonders if this is why the Gulen charter is located there.

Coral Academy successfully opened a school on Davis-Monthan AFB in 2009, and it tried but failed to gain access to Marine Corps Base Hawaii and Naval Station Great Lakes in Illinois. In California, Magnolia Public Schools applied for a charter in Oceanside, where Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton is located, although it temporarily withdrew its application after Amsterdam’s law firm pointed out Magnolia’s connection to the Gülen organization.

Robert Amsterdam asks, “In light of Gülen’s modus operandi elsewhere, the Department of Homeland Security should be asking itself why such a non-transparent, religion-based organization would seek to establish itself on our military bases, teaching the children of our service men and women.” This is the same thing General Michael Flynn was asking!

Seems the Gulen schools do not follow the law either. The charter on Nellis AFB did not have a school nurse on site when a child broke her elbow at recess and was sent back to her classroom for the rest of the day. Now they are claiming there is a nurse on staff. Link

The CIA and Gulen

The plot to overthrow the current government of Turkey by the CIA was first started in 2008 by the US military-intelligence establishment supported think tank American Enterprise Institute (AEI) (please check the link), whose board members are a “who’s who” of American military connected individuals, pharmaceutical companies, CFR members, and Socialist Democrats. Their research papers advocated the United States creating what they call a “moderate Muslim” majority in the Middle East to battle Islamic extremists and whose target nation for this action was Turkey. And Gulen was right there ready to help them. So, is Gulen working for the CIA?

Graham Fuller, the former CIA Station Chief in Istanbul, and former handler of Fethullah Gülen, is allegedly one of the top American experts on Turkey and the Middle East. As a former CIA agent, he endorsed Gülen not only to enter the US, but to take up residence in the Pocono Mountains, and to then start over 100 charter schools. All the while, Gulen collects our tax dollars and indoctrinates our children.

The Turkish media reported that none other than Gülen mentor, “former” CIA man Graham E. Fuller, along with another “former” CIA person and close Fuller associate, were some 20 minutes from Istanbul the night the of failed July 15, 2016 coup attempt which would have replaced President Erdogan with Gulen. Fuller claims to have retired from the agency years ago, when he went over to the CIA-tied RAND Corporation. An article by F. William Engdahl details Fuller’s long involvement with Gulen as well as his links to the two Chechyn brothers accused of the Boston Marathon bombing. It has been reported that the coup plotters intended to whisk Fuller to Greece.

Conclusion

General Michael T. Flynn’s history in military intelligence, his knowledge of Islam, and the Gulen/CIA infiltration into America’s charter schools may well have put him at odds with intelligence insiders at the CIA, NSA and National Security Council. It is my belief that this could have added to the impetus to eliminate the General from the Trump administration, not only by embedded Obama appointees, but also by some of the globalist players surrounding our new president.

Losing General Flynn was a great loss to the Trump administration and to all American citizens.

The White House is about to experience the perils of trial by congressional committee. Although the Russia collusion probe has failed to yield any evidence of criminal wrong-doing, that fact is not going to stop members from grand standing to insinuate obstruction of justice and collusion. The Democratic leadership of today is virtually indistinguishable from the Republicans of yesteryear who worked in tandem with Senator Joseph McCarthy to destroy the reputations of innocent people through character assassination broadcast from each day’s Army McCarthy hearings.

For those of us who have represented clients before Congressional committees, the fact of character assassination is all too real. Members whose own shady history is rich presume to sit in judgment of those called to testify. While purporting to investigate facts germane to one probe or another, all too often they ignore relevant facts that do not fit their narrative and use long winded oratory to substitute for either evidence against their position or no evidence at all. It is indeed a witch hunt.

In this instance, however, those called for the shellacking have the political clout and resources to fire back, and they should. Members who presume to condemn the witnesses and grand stand for media advantage should themselves be thoroughly vetted such that their own sordid histories come to light. It is a sad reality today that most members of Congress are carpet baggers of sorts. Lacking principle but filled with hedonism and a desire to profit off of public office, many members depend on contributions not tracked by the Federal Election laws to finance everything from employment of their children to junkets around the world. Peter Schweizer copiously details the corruption in his book Extortion.

In short, the integrity essential to justice is absent in the typical congressional committee hearing. In this case, Democrats aiming to bring down the Trump presidency by every means possible have no hesitation to do so based on a patently false narrative, that somehow President Trump is a patsy for the Russians or is otherwise complicit in Russian attempts to influence the outcome of the elections. Despite four congressional investigations and Justice Department and FBI probes into the matter for months there is nothing of any consequence that has come to light.

Wasting tax dollars, as the Democratic leaders are want to do across the board, they now aim to maintain a steady drum beat of false accusations in an effort to block consideration of the President’s domestic agenda and confound his political future. As with most of these attempts, this one too is likely to redound to their detriment. While only a minority is likely to find the charges worth exploring despite the absence of evidence, most understand that this is itself obstructionism, designed to render government dysfunctional. While political folly to spend almost every hour of every day banging the drum of false conspiracy and offering no true alternative to the President’s agenda, the Democratic efforts are yielding fruit in the form of dysfunctional government. They are obstructing the President’s ability to pursue his legislative agenda in Congress.

Were Republicans to marshal support for the President and attack those bringing the false charges, there would be less obstructionism. The reality is, however, that many Republicans, including those in leadership positions, dislike the President and therefore ignore or even condone the witch hunt. In the end, those Republicans disserve not only the President who leads their party but also the electorate that expected them to work cohesively with the President to implement his agenda.

When you’ve made a mistake, admit it and be sorry. No one in history has ever choked to death from swallowing his pride. Anonymous

The Art of the Deal

Our President is the very definition of the American success story. Donald J. Trump is street smart, and a real scrapper when it comes to deals, and he has proven that over and over again in business. His book, Art of the Deal, one of 15 best sellers, makes his business acumen clear, but it’s time he stops publicly attacking the one man who supported him from the very beginning, time to take it private and settle it.

As I stated in my last article, our President and our Attorney General need to meet in the White House residence over dinner for a one-on-one chat regarding Sessions’ recusal. Jeff Sessions is a man who is honorable and by the book, and he obviously thought he was doing the right thing, but now he needs to undo his mistake to save the President from Mueller’s witch hunt.

Tom Fitton Says Un-Recuse

Tom Fitton, President of Judicial Watch has publicly stated that our Attorney General can legally un-recuse himself from the Russia election investigation and fire Robert Mueller. [Link]

Fitton says that Sessions probably thought he was recusing himself from a limited set of circumstances. He said, “You can’t have an attorney general that is unable to manage the largest case known to the public that is going on in the Justice Department. Now they have moved beyond Russia and are investigating everything.”

In lieu of a finite charge, Sessions could have delayed recusal and would be on solid legal ground, contends Ken Boehm, chairman of the National Legal and Policy Center, a government watchdog group. Boehm said, “I think the world of Jeff Sessions. I think he’s a good man. But, if you look at every other incident, people in positions at Justice in the past administration wouldn’t do it because they would fear a fishing expedition. Before Sessions recused himself, he should have called for an actual crime, a statute. He would have been on firm legal ground.”

On July 24th, Trish Regan interviewed Fitton on Fox Business and asked Fitton why Sessions isn’t being more aggressive.

Fitton stated, “Because he has recused himself from this key rule of law issue, which is the investigation of what went on during the Obama administration, with respect to how it handled the Clinton investigations, and now this whole Russia collusion scandal which has metastasized under a rogue prosecutor into an investigation into anything this prosecutor wants to investigate. You know, the president has a right to expect that his attorney general and his appointees are going to supervise prosecutors appropriately, and that is not happening here.

And he is not really answerable to anyone, Mueller isn’t, which raises constitutional concerns, but you know, just from a practical perspective, who is running the show at Justice Department? This is a major investigation that is being done without any adult supervision, and there are other investigations that many expect to have been done that the administration — the Justice Department is AWOL on.

He can un-recuse himself. I think he was cornered into recusing himself initially, I think he inappropriately recused himself and he should fix the situation and start running the Justice Department and taking control of these investigations as appropriate.”

Ann Coulter Agrees, Un-Recuse

Back on June 12th, Ann Coulter appeared on Sean Hannity’s program before Jeff Sessions upcoming testimony, and stated unequivocally that AG Sessions should come out swinging and defending his meetings with the Russian Ambassador, while making the case for dissolving the FBI’s Special Counsel investigation headed by former FBI head Robert Mueller. [Link] Watch the video of her interview with Sean.

The only reason Sessions recused himself from this investigation was because he met with the Russian ambassador which every senator has done. The democrats do as well, but the media has an agenda that certainly doesn’t include the truth.

Coulter states, “Claire McKaskill was tweeting out about her meeting with the Russian Ambassador. Dianne Feinstein – there are pictures of them all meeting with the Russian Ambassador. There is nothing improper about Jeff Sessions meeting with the Russian ambassador, and on that, he recuses himself and they demand a special counsel on the false claim, which Comey allowed to sit out there, that Donald Trump himself was personally under investigation.”

She continued, “Sessions has got to say the entire point of having an independent counsel has evaporated with James Comey’s reluctant admission that Trump is not under investigation – so he’s not recusing himself, he’s firing Mueller. The only possible downside is that the media will be hysterical! Will anyone notice the difference? They’ve been calling for Trump’s impeachment before he was sworn in!” [Link]

Coulter and Limbaugh agree and both say the same thing we all say, that Republicans are instinctive losers; they never fight for what is right and they should never apologize or back down. And that includes Sessions!

Ann was right then and she’s right now. Attorney General Jeff Sessions needs to un-recuse himself and fire Mueller.

Hillary Investigation Pledge

Back in late November of 2016, our President-elect said that he probably won’t make good on his campaign pledge to pursue a new criminal investigation into his political rival, Hillary Clinton. He had won the election and was feeling magnanimous towards his defeated rival.

“It’s just not something that I feel very strongly about,” he said in an on-the-record discussion with reporters from The New York Times.

Trump cast his reversal as a unifying move that, contrary to some of the early backlash, he believes won’t upset his supporters.

He said that prosecuting Clinton “would be very, very divisive for the country.”

Trump did, however, suggest he wasn’t taking potential investigations into Clinton off the table, while still remarking that he doesn’t want to “hurt the Clintons.”

“I’m not looking to go back and go through this,” he added.

Two Too Many Recusals

During his confirmation hearing in early January of this year, Jeff Sessions said he would recuse himself from any possible investigations related to Hillary Clinton if he is confirmed as President-elect Donald Trump‘s attorney general. Did he say this because he knew President Trump had decided to not investigate the Clintons?

“I do believe that that could place my objectivity in question,” Sessions told Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). “I believe the proper thing for me to do would be for me to recuse myself.”

I do not believe Sen. Sessions recusal was a wise decision in this case, or in the case of the Russian investigation. I know his reputation is truly stellar, and not only do the folks of Alabama love him, but those who know his Senate reputation love him.

However, Sessions said he would refuse an order from the president to name a special prosecutor to go after Clinton, a move Trump called for during the campaign.

Our candidate of choice led crowds in cheers of “Lock her up,” and then seemingly reneged on his campaign promise to go after her. The prospect of Clinton or any of her cohorts and co-conspirators actually going to prison for their crimes seems increasingly unlikely. Yet, our President is now attacking his Attorney General for failing to investigate Hillary Clinton.

Republicans in Congress have vowed to continue an investigation into Clinton’s private email setup, but like the Obamacare repeal, this seems a false promise.

Giuliani Sides with Sessions

Rumors are circulating of the prospect of replacing AG Sessions with former US Attorney and New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Obviously, our President is not satisfied with AG Sessions’ performance to date. Is he testing the waters or trying to light a fire under his AG?

Giuliani has said that Sessions made the right choice with both the Democrats and Republicans applying pressure for recusal.

Trump’s advisers have also explained to him that anyone who was part of his campaign, including Giuliani, would likely face pressure to recuse themselves from the Russia investigation.

Conclusion

President Trump, you need to meet one-on-one with your Attorney General and stop allowing this disagreement to be public. And the Attorney General needs to step up, and tell the public that his recusals are being withdrawn and he’s immediately firing Robert Mueller and the dozens of Clinton and Obama supporting lawyers Mueller has hired. He also might consider firing Rod Rosenstein for even appointing someone like his buddy, Mueller.

390,https://newswithviews.com/vaccines-good-or-bad-part-8/,newswithviews,"Vaccines: Good or Bad?, Part 8",[],"Vaccines: Good or Bad?, Part 8

The more we look at vaccines the more we see that they are unsafe but as with GMO products the dangers are simply ignored by government and the FDA. Yet we see that the government even produces information that proves they are incompetent concerning the safety of vaccines. Even though the mainstream media push the agenda that “vaccines are safe” the federal government has publicly released vaccine injury payout figures that prove vaccines routinely maim and kill children all across America.

The government’s own document reveals statistics of over 18,000 petitions filed for compensation by families of children who were seriously injured, maimed or killed by vaccines in the United States alone.

The document reveals that a shocking 633 petitions for serious vaccine injury or death have been filed in the fiscal year 2017. This follows 1,120 petitions that were filed in 2016.

The number of petitions filed is a tiny fraction of the total number of children who are seriously harmed by vaccine injuries , as doctors aggressively brainwash parents into believing that seizures, convulsions, autism and other serious conditions are never caused by vaccines. Furthermore, families of vaccine-injured children must hire an attorney to file a petition with the U.S. government, then wait anywhere from two to ten years for a decision by a “kangaroo court” that’s stacked against them. Thus, in nearly all cases of vaccine injury, parents are convinced into either believing that vaccines had nothing to do with the injury or that trying to fight the government for compensation is a complete waste of time. (This is all by design.)

As a result, the real number of vaccine-injured children in America is at least 100 times larger, and more reasonably as much as 1000 times larger when you consider “minor” brain damage, short-term seizures and other conditions that are difficult for parents to notice.

In other words, there are at least 63,000 vaccine-injured children in America from 2017 alone, making vaccine injuries a leading cause of injury in children. This is all hidden and denied by the pharma-controlled media, of course, which wants you to focus on 48 children with measles in Michigan rather than 63,000 vaccine-injured children all across America.[1]

As America inches towards a police state depicted in 1984 even Republicans are jumping on the anti-freedom bandwagon and pushing for mandatory vaccines just to keep your job! A new bill, HR 1313, has been introduced by North Carolina Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R) which is designed to give employers absolute power over the employee by mandating whatever they deem to be proper “heath prevention” measures. These measures would include submitting DNA records as well as mandatory vaccinations and other perceived “health preventive” measures designed for the “greater good” of the general public. The result of not complying with this new law of course would be losing your job.

This kind of legislation thus gives large corporations government-like political status and god-like powers over the individual and further widens the gap between the rich and poor. But even more importantly this kind of legislation strips away intimate individual medical privacy and further solidifies the global control grid being created by the ruling elite as they attempt to complete their new world order plans of permanent human enslavement. No need to imagine how this “future” new world order enslavement will look like anymore. We’re seeing it all being rolled out in real-time and in broad daylight for the world to see.[2]

America deserves the freedom to participate in the healthcare they want not what the government or even the large corporation demand. This North Carolina bill is actually part of Obamacare but is being pushed by RINO Republicans. Globalists have infiltrated both parties but try to make it look like they are doing thing for the benefit of the people when in reality it is to benefit government and big corporations.

What is not being exposed to the general public is the fact that there are still many things about vaccines that are not understood by the medical community. I think these problems need to be solved before we continue to expose our kids and even adults to these potentially dangerous drugs. The US government department for Health Resources and Services Administration has recently released the running tally of the just-past-half-way-complete US Fiscal Year (FY) of 2017 for compensable vaccine injuries. It currently stands at over $142 million dollars. You read that right. That covers the 377 cases that were thus far successful in obtaining compensation in the fiscal year 2017 through the heavily biased (to put it politely) system allegedly in place to redress the damage done by vaccines in the USA.

At the rate things are going, we might expect the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program to pay out around $220 million or more by the close of FY 2017. To clarify, US Fiscal Year 2017 runs from October 1st, 2016 to September 30th, 2017 – there’s still over four months remaining to rack up more carnage.

According to the CDC’s website, there are “limitations in our knowledge of the risks associated with vaccines” and vaccinations have “the following problems”:

Limited understanding of biological processes that underlie adverse events Incomplete and inconsistent information from individual reports Poorly constructed research studies (not enough people enrolled for the period of time) Inadequate systems to track vaccine side effects Few experimental studies were published in the medical literature.”1 (emphasis added)

The above very revealing admissions from the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) completely undercut the pathological overconfidence exhibited in the extreme portions of the community pushing for mandatory vaccination.[3]

Even when there has been obvious evidence that there is a problem there is inaction from the government agencies that are in place specifically to prevent these types of problems. Last Thursday, May 9, 2017, the Duluth News-Tribune re-published, on their Opinion Page/Other View, an editorial previously published in The Free Press of Mankato, MN. The title of the DNT was “Not Learning from our Errors” and the Free Press title was “Debunked vaccine fear taking toll on Minnesota”.

Also last week a Duluth Reader reader from Tower, MN wrote a letter to the editor criticizing a recent Duty to Warn article of mine that could (and should) undermine the confidence that people have in the vaccine industry and the clinics and physicians who follow the so-called “scientific consensus” on the CDC’s, FDA’s and AAP’s vaccine mandates (and presumably for the rapid institution of the 271 new vaccines that are in Big Pharma’s pipeline into the CDC’s already over-vaccination agenda).

Both articles mentioned the oft-referenced case of Andrew Wakefield and his dozen co-authors who reported on their evaluations of a series of 12 severely disabled autistic children who were all also chronically ill with severe abdominal pain and chronic diarrhea, whose parents had brought them to the team for evaluation. The parents knew that their child had been developmentally normal prior to the MMR vaccinations and, following the inoculations, had deteriorated both neuro-developmentally and gastro-intestinally.

Wakefield, a gastroenterologist, and his team performed various studies, including colonoscopies and biopsies, on the very sick children. The viral assays that were done showed that the viral enteropathy was caused by a strain of measles that was identical to that which was in GlaxoSmithKline’s MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine.

So the conclusion that could not be avoided was that the bowel disorder in the vaccine-injured children was actually an iatrogenic disease (physician- or treatment-caused) that was caused by the MMR shot. It was not much of a jump to also conclude that the accompanying autism disorder was also iatrogenic.[4]

When findings like these come out big pharma goes on the attack to discredit the researchers. It is simply proof that money is more important to them than the lives of the people they destroy. To a powerful multinational corporation like Glaxo (and their shareholders), that was an intolerable finding and something had to be done to try to discredit the findings and the authors. Threats to most of the team succeeded in disavowal, except for Wakefield and another (who was later totally legally absolved of any ulterior motivations).

The article was also an intolerable finding for the hospitals, clinics, physicians and nurses in the entire National Health Service (and the world’s health systems) who had been indoctrinated with the notion that all vaccines were safe and effective. Because of their indoctrination, they had been complacently administering larger and larger amounts and more types of vaccines, assuming that the repeated reassurances from Big Pharma were true that VACCINES WERE NOT THE CAUSE OF AUTISM.[5]

We must stay vigilant concerning the government’s attempt to take over the medical decisions that belong only to the American people. We must stand for our rights or we will have none.

True freedom requires the rule of law and justice, and a judicial system in which the rights of some are not secured by the denial of rights to others. Jonathan Sacks

The people in general ought to have regard to the moral character of those whom they invest with authority either in the legislative, executive, or judicial branches. John Witherspoon

Judge Gorsuch’s 2008 Decision

Judge Gorsuch’s 2008 decision in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit was the touchstone for Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District, the case the justices heard in January, and have just now unanimously decided for the plaintiff. Believe me folks, this is not good for our school districts or for taxpayers.

At issue was an autistic youngster who had been in public school from kindergarten to fourth grade. The parents decided the child was not progressing as they expected in fifth grade, so they put him in a private school costing $70,000 a year.

They then sued the school to pay for the private school cost because they claimed he wasn’t reaching his potential in the public school despite 37 hours of special-ed services per week.

This case first went to an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) for review, and the ALJ rejected Endrew’s parent’s request for reimbursement concluding that Endrew’s public school had provided him with “free appropriate public education” (FAPE) as required by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), an act signed into law in 1990 by George H.W. Bush, a law which needs repealing.

Then the district court affirmed their ruling, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit also affirmed, as did Judge Gorsuch who ruled the school had reached their “de minimis” standard. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires States to provide “merely more than de minimis” in providing “some educational benefit” to students under the IDEA.

Supremes Overturn Gorsuch Ruling

On March 22, 2017, the Supreme Court unanimously overturned the 10th circuit court decision, ruling in favor of higher standards for disabled children via IDEA in the case brought by plaintiff child, Endrew.

Sadly, Judge Gorsuch apologized in the confirmation hearings for his ruling against this autistic child, saying that he was bound by precedent, which Gorsuch does not like to go against. In this case, he should have held his ground, because he was right! And, apologies win nothing!

So, from now on when parents of a disabled child decide (all of which is subjective) that their child is not making the proper advances in a public school, they can arbitrarily send their child to a costly private school and have the school district pay for it. The school district is funded by TAXPAYERS!!!

Do you understand what this will cost the American taxpayer in real estate taxes to support the local school districts who will have to pay high costs when a parent decides the school isn’t doing the job they expect? Just who will decide who gets taxpayer dollars for their child’s special education, because the school district doesn’t meet their objectives? More unelected councils?

Think about the Education Czar, Betsy DeVos, who wants to privatize our public schools and have corporations running them for profit! The public schools will either go broke or tax us to death for the costs which will also affect private, and religious schools. Betsy Devos is anathema to academic education, but few people understand how very dangerous she truly is to our children. She will love this decision, because it plays right into her hands.

Dems Confirm Gorsuch Filibuster

The Democrats just confirmed they will filibuster Gorsuch, requiring that he be withdrawn and replaced.

Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, son of the famous Pennsylvania pro-life Gov. Bob Casey, who is up for reelection, and who pretends to be pro-life, announced he will join the filibuster. Gorsuch and the pro-choice backed and funded Federalist Society made that easy for Sen. Casey to do. It might even help his reelection in light of Gorsuch’s pro-choice performance.

Another Democratic Senator up for reelection, who also pretends to be pro-life, is Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, and he may join the filibuster. The Democrats may have enough votes to block Gorsuch.

This truly creates a second chance for 30 million unborn babies, for Trump’s advisers, and for the Republican Party to nominate someone who is actually pro-life, like Charles Canady of Florida. Second chances do not occur often in politics, but here it is, so time to pray and work, because big money is for Gorsuch.

Koch Brothers Fund Gorsuch Nomination

The Koch brothers, David and Charles, and other billionaires who are pro-abortion are clamoring for the Senate to change their rules to try to overcome the filibuster.

David and Charles Koch

The Koch brothers (pronounced “Coke”) are the billionaire co-owners of Koch Industries. As two of the richest people in the world, they are key funders of the neo-con infrastructure, including the pro-Constitutional Convention, American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), and the State Policy Network (mini-Heritage Foundations in each state). Key articles on the Kochs include: Koch Brothers, Koch Industries, Americans for Prosperity, and Freedom Partners.

David Koch is on the board of Trustees of Rockefeller University. He is also on the board of Earthwatch Institute, an environmental, sustainability, Agenda 21 group, and the board of the globalist new age Aspen Institute. See this map of Koch’s many connections. David Koch also supports abortion, gay marriage, and stem-cell research.

The secret donors who are financing ads for Gorsuch don’t care about the unborn. They’re just fine with the prospect of relegating pro-life senators to irrelevancy in future confirmation battles. Many senators, both Republican and conservative Democrats, have spoken out against changing their rules to confirm Gorsuch. Changing the rules to confirm pro-choice Gorsuch would be a colossal mistake for the pro-life movement, for the GOP, and for our country.

All President Trump has to do is pick a pro-life nominee who has a base of support, which Gorsuch never had. The sooner Trump does this, the sooner his own polling will improve.

It is essential that we pray for our President, for the unborn, and for our country. We need to help him keep all his promises to the American people. We also need to pray that he has discernment as to those who surround and guide him.

Conclusion

Never in my lifetime have I seen so many advertisements for a Supreme Court nominee, but then the Koch billionaires are allegedly paying for them. And, Gorsuch, a term limit CFR member will join two other CFR members on the court, Breyer and Ginsberg. Here is a short tutorial on the CFR.

The first week after his nomination, Neil Gorsuch told a US senator that President Donald Trump’s tweets about the judiciary, i.e., Judge Robard’s restraining order against Trump’s immigration ban, are “demoralizing” and “disheartening.” He also said in his confirmation hearing that “Judges have to “start with a heavy, heavy presumption in favor of precedent in our system,” which is why he loves stare decisis, and will probably never vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. Stare decisis is Latin for “to stand by things decided,” and is the doctrine of precedent.

During the confirmation hearings, while being questioned by Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., on the destruction of unborn children, Gorsuch stated “the Supreme Court of the United States has held in Roe v. Wade that a fetus is not a person for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.”

When Durbin asked if he accepted that, the judge replied, “That’s the law of the land. I accept the law of the land, senator, yes.”

And his statement on “same-sex marriage,” Gorsuch acknowledged the Supreme Court had ruled such marriages are protected by the Constitution. He declared Obergefell v. Hodges, which struck down “same-sex marriage” bans nationwide in 2015, to be “absolutely settled law.”

I believe Gorsuch will be confirmed, but I am praying he is not. The theatre being played out by the democrats and some of the left leaning neo-conservative Republicans is just that, theatre for the dumbed down believing masses, who don’t understand the game.

One need only remember that in 2006, when Neil Gorsuch was nominated by George W. Bush, “not a single Democrat opposed his confirmation in 2006,” tweeted Mitch McConnell on February 1st. Both Bush families stated they were pro-choice after they were out of office. It is likely the Democrat Senators knew the families were really pro-choice and thus confirmed their nominee. Here’s the list of the leftists who confirmed him.

The Senators most likely know that Neil Gorsuch is another John Roberts or Kennedy, and is no Antonin Scalia.

One issue that doesn’t get discussed enough on talk radio – like Limbaugh & Hannity who command at least 20 million listeners a week or cable news networks is the issue of pensions: city, county, state, private. The warnings have been out there for many years, but Americans either don’t know they should be worried or they simply trust whoever is managing their pension funds.

P.E.R.S. – Oregon’s Grand Delusion, June 4, 2006, and has time has gone by, Fred lays it all out just as he predicted:

P.E.R.S.: Lies, Distortions, Half-Truths and Fraud, September 14, 2013

Why Josephine County (Oregon) is Broke, January 27, 2015:

“Wonder why the county is out of money?

“Recently Rosemary Padgett, (Tier one PERS recipient) County Financial Officer (CFO) retired. She will receive a pension 38% more than her final salary of $147,000 a year. That would be a yearly retirement pension of $202,860.00 plus a 2% COLA (Cost of Living Adjustment) each year until death, which means that her 5th year pension will be $233,973.83. Why be in free enterprise?

“Also, on top of PERS, Rosemary will receive her Social Security, and be exempt from state income tax like all other retired government employees! According to Fidelity Investments the capital requirement for a single female at age 60. For a $150,000 a year pension without a COLA costs: $2,833,000.00!”

Imagine it’s you in the piece below. What you have budgeted to live on is determined by your pension and likely social security. Then imagine one day you are notified your pension has been sliced by 50% or more. Heart stopping.

Well, I’m afraid the news couldn’t be worse for some Americans and this is just the tip of the iceberg:

Another blow for heartland workers: Slashed pensions, July 20, 2017

“February was a bad month for Larry Burruel and thousands of other retired Ohio iron workers. His monthly take-home pension was cut by more than half from $3,700 to $1,600.

“Things have been rough in the Rust Belt, but this was a particularly powerful punch in the pocketbook for Burruel, who started in the trade at 19 and worked 36 years before opting for early retirement to make way for younger workers. Unfortunately, this sagging industry doesn’t have enough younger workers to pay for retirees like Burruel, whose pension plan is in what the U.S. Treasury Department calls “critical and declining status.”

“Burruel and the 4,000 members of his Cleveland Iron Workers Local 17 pension plan are the canaries in the coal mine as far as pension cutbacks go. At least 50 Midwestern pension plans — mostly the kind jointly administered by trustees for a labor union and a group of employers — are in this decrepit condition. Several plan sponsors have already applied to the Treasury Department to cut back retirees’ allotments…

“However, it’s not clear what would be fair. The hammer is falling on the private pension funds that are running out of cash. And those shortfalls have many reasons. “The stock market crash had a huge effect,” said Outreach Director Joellen Leavelle of the Pension Rights Center. “Some plans lost billions.” It was a loss from which they never recovered…

“For now, both healthy public pension funds and private pension funds aren’t at risk. But for those who are affected, it hurts a lot, said Pat Overstreet of Hinckley, Ohio. She and her former iron worker husband refinanced their home to pay for their daughter’s brain tumor treatment. But since his pension has been cut from $2,500 to $930, they may lose their house, she said.”

What about the UN-healthy pension funds?

Governor signs bill to ,repair pension plan for corrections officers, April 18, 2017



(Phoenix, State Capitol) — “Governor Ducey has signed SB 1442, a bill sponsored by Senator Debbie Lesko that repairs and reforms Arizona’s Corrections Officer Retirement Plan (CORP). The pension plan is currently broken, funded at only 53%. In the past 15 years, the employer contribution rate has grown from 3.2% to 18.2%, a 600 percent increase!”



READ: Pensions Timebomb In America – “Global Crisis” Cometh, June 30, 2017



Your pension could be at the center of America’s next financial crisis, March 24, 2017

“According to one pension advocacy organization, nearly 1 million working and retired Americans are covered by pension plans at the risk of collapse. The looming pension crisis is not limited by geography or economic focus. These including former public employees, such as members of South Carolina’s government pension plan, which covers roughly 550,000 people – one out of nine state residents – and is a staggering $24.1 billion in the red. These include former blue collar workers such as roughly 100,000 coal miners who face serious cuts in pension payments and health coverage thanks to a nearly $6 billion shortfall in the plan for the United Mine Workers of America. And when the bill comes due, we will all be in very big trouble.”

California uses one state credit card to pay off another, July 9, 2017

“Contained within the budget is a plan worked up by Gov. Brown and State Treasurer John Chiang that greenlights the state to borrow reserve cash from state government accounts and to plow the proceeds into the California’s pension investment fund.

“The idea is that the higher yielding pension fund will earn more than enough to cover both interest on the new debt and pay down some of the state’s pension obligations. Over the past two decades, several states and localities tried very similar schemes to deal with their own pension problems, but the practice is fraught with risk, and it has backfired spectacularly on more than a few occasions.”

After A “Run On The Pension Fund” Dallas Mayor Demands Halt Of Withdrawals, Nov. 30, 2016

“As the Board is well aware, at the beginning of this year, the actuarial value of assets under your supervision and control were reset to market value, resulting in a $1 billion valuation loss. This significant markdown was the result of years of mismanagement and abuse.

“Critically the Pension System’s actuary warned that the Pension System would become insolvent even sooner if Deferred Retirement Option Plan (“DROP”) funds are drawn down in less than a ten-year period.

“Despite this clear warning, you have inexplicably paid out nearly $500 million in lump-sum DROP withdrawals over a matter of mere months – notwithstanding your power to unilaterally restrict or limit DROP withdrawals. In doing so, you have knowingly allowed DROP funds to be withdrawn at record levels, cognizant that doing so is irreparably harming the Pensions System’s solvency and liquidity.

“Already, as a result of your actions, the Pension System’s ability to pay its members’ future benefits has been irreparably reduced from a period of 15 years to 10 years. Further, both the City of Dallas and the Pension System have projected that DROP withdrawals, if unabated, will lead to a liquidity crisis in the Pension System with the next 90 days, causing a forced sale of illiquid assets. Your Board Chairman summed it up best when referring to the payment of DROP withdrawals: “- the continuation of this practice would be financial suicide.” And yet the practice continues.

“Given the urgency of this matter, I request a response within 48 hours as to whether the Board will immediately cease DROP payments until such time as the solvency and actuarial soundness of the Pension System is restored.”

Detroit Pension Cuts From Bankruptcy Prompt Cries of Betrayal, Feb. 5, 2015:

“Pension checks will shrink 6.7 percent for 12,000 Detroit retirees beginning in March. Making matters worse, many also must pay back thousands of dollars of excess interest they received. It’s a bitter outcome of Detroit’s record $18 billion municipal bankruptcy for David Espie, 58, who will repay the city $75,000 in a lump sum while his $3,226 monthly pension is cut by $216.

“As retirement costs swallow larger portions of U.S. city budgets, Detroit’s bankruptcy plan resolved a pension crisis with creative strokes, though at a cost to retirees who thought their benefits were untouchable. “I feel betrayed,” said Espie, who may abandon plans to move to Alabama. He recounted family get-togethers he missed during the 30 years he spent in the Department of Public Works picking up trash and plowing snow. He also pays $500 a month more for health insurance than a year ago.” The rest is a horror story.



Outrageous: National epidemic: Public employees ‘spiking’ pensions

Those are but a few examples of a national crisis piled on top of Obamacare killing off disposable income for tens of millions of Americans who struggle to pay the outrageous premiums. When people begin to panic – like a sucker punch to the gut when they read real life stories like the ones above – they stop spending. They hoard because they don’t know what’s coming next – especially if you depend on or will depend on some pension fund to supplement your social security. In some state systems employees don’t pay into SS only their pension fund.

Of course, such contractions have dire consequences to local economies and you see businesses shutter. Big box chain stores aren’t just going out of business because of behemoth Amazon (who I feel is biting off more than Bezos’ can chew and as they say, the bigger they are the harder they fall). It’s because for Americans, despite the healthy optimism out there as a result of President Trump getting some important things done – like axing a boat load of unnecessary business killing regulations – reality is still out there. Grossly under-funded pensions ig one of the biggest.

If you will depend on a pension down the road or are receiving one now you really should look into its solvency and keep up with the numbers.

Be decisive. Right or wrong, make a decision. The road of life is paved with flat squirrels who couldn’t make a decision. And after all, it is not hard to make decisions when you know what your values are. Roy Disney

President Trump’s NYTs Interview

President Trump agreed to an interview with NYTs reporters, Peter Baker, Michael S. Schmidt and Maggie Haberman. The latter occasionally gives this administration a fair shake, and she even commented on how upbeat Trump was. When she actually had a chance to speak to him, she couldn’t believe that he was so cordial.

Michael Schmidt was one of the interviewers, and I was surprised since Schmidt was the primary recipient of leaks provided by fired FBI Director James Comey and his allies and the leaked information was intended to damage the office of our President.

In the interview, President Trump expressed his anger that AG Sessions recused himself from the Russia/collusion investigation. He also expressed his obvious displeasure with the way Mueller is handling this investigation. Look, the President’s responses to reporters’ questions were sincere and honest. He told us clearly that he doesn’t appreciate what the recusal cost him and what Rosenstein unleashed upon him, his family, and his young presidency, with the appointment of Mueller. He’s correct to be angry about it.

But the truth is, this all came from Comey, didn’t it! That snake set the stage for a special prosecutor with his leaks. How was Sessions to know what Comey would unleash in his testimony when he recused himself? He didn’t. Not only that, but AG Sessions is one who follows the law explicitly and that’s why he recused himself. Nevertheless, he would have been wise to have spoken to his boss prior to deciding to recuse.

The Decision to Recuse

If Jeff Sessions had not recused himself, who in the administration would tell the attorney general that even the appearance of a potential conflict of interest is a very bad thing? No one! Who would say publicly that staying on would violate official Department of Justice regulations, (28 CFR 45.2) (28 U.S.C. § 528) other than the usual Democratic loons in the House and Senate and the self-righteous cretins in the fake news media? Again, no one.

The latter DOJ regulation mentioned above actually leaves it to the Attorney General to promulgate regulations with more detailed criteria for assessing such conflicts. And as with many conflict of interest provisions, the law makes clear that even an appearance of such a conflict is legally problematic.

Sessions served as the chairman of the Trump campaign’s national security advisory committee. His close affiliation with Trump and the campaign, and the potential conflicts of interest that creates, was the excuse used by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to call AG Sessions to resign over reports that he spoke with Russia’s ambassador to the United States during the presidential campaign. What rot!

Then our weak Republicans joined in by calling for Sessions to recuse himself. This is so typical of the neo-con Trotskyite Republicans who are fighting this administration as hard as the left. Talk about a lack of chutzpah! This would never have happened with Obama; the left would have raised holy Hannah.

In early March, Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation on the advice of Justice Department ethics officials, saying, “They said that since I had involvement with the campaign, I should not be involved in any campaign investigation.”

So, was Jeff just following the law and now Trump is making a mistake in attacking his top supporter? Or should Jeff have said to those demanding his recusal, “Folks, I’m hired to do a job, and I’ll do that job no matter who is in charge without any prejudicial influence.”

Sessions Response to NYT’s Interview

After the President’s statements regarding the recusal, when asked if he would resign, our Attorney General stated that he was honored to have the job and intended to stay in it and work hard for both national interests and President Trump. He said that the President gave them several directives, one of which was to dismantle internet transnational organizations. He then announced that they had dismantled the largest “Dark Web” site in the world. Sessions then said that he loves the job, loves the department and intends to continue. Rosenstein basically said the same thing. Watch the three-minute video:

AG Sessions was flanked by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Acting Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Andrew McCabe, who were both also criticized by the president in the New York Times interview. I view these two as fifth column insiders who should have been canned long ago. Comey, Rosenstein and Mueller are long time affiliates. Andrew McCabe is actually facing three federal inquiries for (1) sexual discrimination and subsequent retaliation against the complainant, (General Michael T. Flynn) (2) campaigning as an FBI official for his wife, which is a violation of the Hatch Act, and (3) ethics violations relating to campaign payments to his wife.

Our Attorney General has also reinstated civil asset forfeitures for police departments, stating that this helps law enforcement defund organized crime. Unfortunately, some innocent people have had to hire legal help to get their funds back, and in some cases, they lose.

Back in March, our AG required the resignations of 46 Obama appointed U.S. attorneys. He has cleaned house in the past, but the DOJ needs to be thoroughly sanitized of all appointees by previous administrations.

Mueller Expands His Witch Hunt Investigation On Trump



During the interview with the Times, President Trump said if special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia Investigation looked into the Trump family finances, it would cross a red line, and he’s right.

Mueller is looking into President Trump’s entire business transactions as part of the ongoing probe into the phony alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russians according to a report in Bloomberg. He is pushing his investigation into territories previously warned against by the President himself, and journalist Lou Dobbs has some advice for the Commander in Chief. Here’s what he said:

“I personally believe it’s time for President Trump to get rid of Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein, and get rid of special investigator Robert Mueller, clear out the Obama leftovers in the Department of Justice, and appoint officials to investigate the real corruption and toxic collusion in the D.C. swamp.”

Deputy AG Rosenstein said, “It’s time to do the right thing” – it’s past time. Dobbs denounced the blatant conflicts of interest infesting the Trump-Russia election collusion conspiracy theory being investigated by Mueller and his team of Democrat operatives, noting, “Nearly half of them gave money to Hillary Clinton or to President Obama.”

Dobbs is right of course. President Trump first needs to direct Rosenstein to limit the scope of Mueller’s investigation to the fake Russian election collusion, and that if Mueller doesn’t limit the investigation to what he was hired for, he will be fired. The President also needs to tell Rosenstein that if he doesn’t follow these orders, he too will be fired.

The Real Law Breakers

From Whitewater to Benghazi, we all know what the Clinton cabal is about. Pay to play, Clinton Foundation, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, selling influence, and 20% of our uranium to Russia for a big payoff. “Lock her up” was not just a campaign slogan!

And then there’s Holder’s and Obama’s Fast and Furious, and Comey’s illegal leaks of classified information, Loretta Lynch, John Brennan, Susan Rice and others who orchestrated all this phony Russia narrative and leaks to delegitimize Trump’s presidency. Americans want our DOJ to go after the criminals of the Dark State.

Tucker Carlson Berates President Trump

I don’t watch Carlson because he has a habit of talking over guests, and you can’t understand either of them when both are speaking. Tucker is not the professional Bill O’Reilly was, albeit I wasn’t a big fan of O’Reilly. Needless to say, this attack on our President was uncalled for and spewed an invective that normally appears only on MSM. Now it’s all over on the web, thanks to the arrogance of Tucker Carlson.

He commented, “President Trump’s attack on Jeff Sessions in the failing NY Times suggests he’s forgetting who’s on his side. Sessions is one of the few who believed in him from the start and was making progress on his agenda.”

President Trump and AG Sessions

Donald John Trump gave up a lifestyle that we can only imagine, his wonderful family, his beautiful wife and their son, and a life of ease running a billion-dollar business to save his country. He is not a politician. He is simply a citizen who loves America and has spent his own money to lead our country back to greatness. He is not perfect, only God has that claim, but he loves the USA, and he’s fighting to save not only America, but his own presidency from the left’s onslaught.

President Trump, you are the leader of America, and as such, it is up to you to guide the people in your administration, yet still allowing them to make their own choices. Please invite Attorney General Sessions to the White House residence for a one on one discussion. Have dinner together and discuss where this will go, who in the DOJ needs to be fired, and how to handle the Dark State enemies of freedom.

AG Sessions may have made a mistake in recusing himself, but this can be worked out, and he is a strong supporter of your agenda as well as all your promises. He is working hard to help you in many ways.

President Trump and Rod Rosenstein

Secondly, invite Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein for a one-on-one dinner in the White House residence. You nominated Rosenstein, and he has put Mueller in charge of this investigation, and Mueller has gone off the rails by hiring Clinton and Obama supporters who plan to investigate your entire business life as well as the election. Rosenstein’s choice of Robert Mueller tells your supporters that he is left of center in appointing someone who is definitely not bipartisan. If he doesn’t rein in Mueller, tell him his days are numbered, and so are Mueller’s. Lou Dobbs is right.

Conclusion

Tucker Carlson is right about one aspect. Sessions, like General Flynn and Steve Bannon are the renegades Trump hired in the beginning. They are the backbone of support for this President and the American people. They are the people we want in this administration, not the fifth column Dark State who seems to occasionally whisper in his ear. Trump cannot afford another loss.

Our President has suffered the most evil and vindictive lies and slander from the Democratic establishment socialists and MSM. His own party has fought him on fulfilling the promises he’s made to the American people, the very people who elected him because of those promises. He has been inundated and deluged with false charges, not only on his person, but on his family and those in his administration. It has been non-stop from the moment he announced his candidacy, and it revved up to a point of psychosis when Hillary was defeated by this populist leader who remembers the greatness of our country.

Never discount what Trump says or does, often his plans are far ahead of what we see. We play checkers, and he’s playing chess.

As Sun Tzu said, “He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.”

It’s up to us. We must demand Congress works to help our President.

394,https://newswithviews.com/declaration-of-independence-our-rights-come-from-god/,newswithviews,Declaration of Independence: Our Rights Come From God,[],"Declaration of Independence: Our Rights Come From God

There is a Creator God and He determines right and wrong, good and evil… not man. This is the most important foundational principle of law and justice. If this principle is not understood as absolute, undeniable truth, one could conclude that every principle in our founding charter, The Declaration of Independence is a lie. If there is any shadow of a doubt about the fact that the God of the Bible is our Creator and He alone, totally independent of the will of man, determines right and wrong, good and evil; then I would ask that you review the first two lectures. Until you thoroughly understand this concept and are in full agreement with this fact; then and only then, will the rest of this lecture series make any sense.

Video of the sermon

While every word in our Founding Charter is important perhaps the second most important principle of freedom to understand is that Our Rights come from God – Not Government, therefore they are not subject to the Repeal or Restrictions of Human Laws. The Declaration of Independence states, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.” If the proper role of government is to secure our unalienable rights, it is essential that we have an accurate understanding of that term at the time it was written.

Alienable according to Webster’s 1828 Dictionary means, “That may be… transferred to another…”[1] Therefore if the American Founders wanted to indicate that their rights could have been transferred to their elected representatives to be regulated and controlled, they would have used that term. However, they chose to describe our rights as unalienable, that which cannot be transferred to another. John Adams, a member of the committee that drafted the Declaration, made this understanding indisputable when he explained, “I say RIGHTS, for such they have, undoubtedly, antecedent to all earthly government, — Rights, that cannot be repealed or restrained by human laws — Rights, derived from the great Legislator of the universe.”[2] Note that Adams said, “…rights that cannot be repealed or restrained by human laws…”

The Virginia Constitution, a document with which Thomas Jefferson the chief author of the Declaration had intimate knowledge, reinforces this understanding when it states in ARTICLE 1 and Section 1, “A DECLARATION OF RIGHTS made by the good people of Virginia in the exercise of their sovereign powers,[3] which rights do pertain to them and their posterity, as the basis and foundation of government. That all men are by nature equally free and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter into a state of society, they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.”[4] That is “all men… have… rights… they cannot, by any [agreement be] deprived [of]…” Again notice the phrase that our rights, “cannot, by any compact, [be] deprive[d] or divest[ed]…”

The Virginia Constitution removes all doubt that the rights we have in a state of nature are what the Declaration of Independence calls unalienable rights and further clarifies them by stating that these rights belong to everyone and their descendants. That is to say that everyone on the earth has what our Declaration of Independence calls unalienable rights, whether one is an American or not, because our rights come from our Creator, not government. All people all over the world are born with unalienable rights and no one has a right to take them away or regulate or control them. However this does not mean that all governments equally protect these God-given rights or even recognize them.

Absolute Rights

At this point some may ask: “Why is it so important that we understand that we have rights that cannot be restrained or repealed by man-made laws?” After all as the modern pragmatists claim, “Shouldn’t we be reasonable and understand that for the good of the whole we should expect that our government officials must be able to place certain reasonable restrictions on our rights by requiring a qualifying license or permit or completely denying them by law?” While today many seem to feel this way, let me see if I can explain why our Founders were very much opposed to this idea. At the heart of their reasoning were their Biblical roots.

God commands, “Hate evil, love good; Establish justice in the gate….” (Amos 5:15)[5] The gate is the seat of civil authority… like our courthouse or statehouse. Justice is doing that which is right according to the Creator. As we have stated before God commanded, “You shall not murder” (Exodus 20:13) therefore we have a right to life. God said, “You shall not steal” (Exodus 20:15) and “You shall not covet” (Exodus 20:17) therefore we have a right to property. Then He directed that you shall not man steal or kidnap therefore we have a right to liberty (Exodus 21:16). Our unalienable rights come from the negative law of the Ten Commandments and they cannot be alienated because they are part of the unchanging character of God (Malachi 3:6a). (Not only do we have an obligation not to violate the rights of our fellow man, we have a responsibility to protect them as was pointed out last week.

Who are we to claim that the word of the Creator of the universe is not valid and that we have the right to rule in His place? We will either be ruled by the Bible or by the will of the strong. We will stand up for Biblical justice or we will be ruled by the arbitrary will of our fellow man. Just because we delegated our God-given authority to fulfill our obligations to our representatives in government that in no way relieves us of our obligations. They are our civil servants and if they are acting outside of our authority it is up to us to rein them in; God will hold us accountable. The Virginia Constitution statesthe people are the sovereigns and have the ultimate responsibility to ensure our civil servants don’t exceed the legitimate authority we have delegated them.

RIGHTS

Many within the modern church teach that we should be willing to give up our rights for the common good, but this is not what the Bible teaches. Psalm 82:3,4 proclaims, “Defend the cause of the weak and fatherless; maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed. Rescue the weak and needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked.” How can the Christian establish justice in government, if they refuse to get involved in the political process?

Referring to rulers, Proverbs 31:5 states, “lest they drink and forget what the law decrees, and deprive all the oppressed of their rights.” Proverbs 31:8-9 further states, “Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy.” If government is our collective rightful use of force to protect our life, liberty and property, why do we let government act contrary to these goals? Why do Christians allow this to occur?”

Isaiah 10:1-4 NIV, “Woe to those who make unjust laws, to those who issue oppressive decrees, to deprive the poor of their rights and withhold justice from the oppressed of my people, making widows their prey and robbing the fatherless.” Jeremiah 5:26-29 “Among my people are wicked men who lie in wait like men who snare birds and like those who set traps to catch men. Like cages full of birds, their houses are full of deceit; they have become rich and powerful and have grown fat and sleek. Their evil deeds have no limit; they do not plead the case of the fatherless to win it, they do not defend the rights of the poor. Should I not punish them for this?” declares the LORD. “Should I not avenge myself on such a nation as this?” If “We the People” are the sovereigns as the Virginia Constitution claims, aren’t we ultimately responsible for what we allow our civil servants to do?

Lamentations 3:34-36 states, “To crush underfoot all prisoners in the land, to deny a man his rights before the Most High, to deprive a man of justice— would not the Lord see such things?” Does God give us the option to not get involved in the political arena when we see our so-called civil servants using the force of law to desecrate the rights of others? Doesn’t a man have a right to the fruit of his labor? Isn’t it theft to use force to take from a man what he has earned and give it to someone else? Isn’t it a violation of the law of liberty to interfere with the actions of others until they have in some way violated the equal rights of others?

Does not Godly love require us to look out for the rights of others? In the New Testament, we find Jesus consumed with zeal for his Father’s house and showing love and compassion for those being robbed as he drove the culprits away. In the Book of Matthew chapter 21:12,13, “Then Jesus went into the temple of God and drove out all those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves. And He said to them, “It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a ‘den of thieves.’” Are our local, state, and federal officials little more than “a den of thieves” depriving those who earned from enjoying the fruits of their labor and redistributing their wealth to ensure their own reelection? Where is the indignation of the average Christian in regards to the so-called legalized plunder in government?

Jesus broke the existing civil code when He drove out the legal robbers. Read the account. The Jewish leaders were upset because the moneychangers were sanctioned by the temple authorities and asked by what authority Jesus drove out the swindlers. Therefore, you can have complete confidence that the idea of God-ordained rights is very much in line with Biblical teaching. Every citizen has a right to the produce of their own labor. They have a right not to be interfered with until they have violated the rights of others or God’s moral law. This was validated when God wrote in stone, “You shall not steal.” (Exodus 20:15) On the other hand the only rights you may have according to the secularist, progressive, or statist, are what is granted by the state. The statist philosophy of all power or authority originating in the state would make Christ out to be a sinner. It is time for the Christians to stand in the gate, the seat of civil authority, and promote Godly justice. The Word of the Lord in Isaiah 1:17 states, “…Seek justice, Rebuke the oppressor, Defend the fatherless, Plead for the widow.”

THE PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES

Though not immediately apparent to most people, the principle of “Unalienable Rights” is arguably the second most important concept of freedom that sets America apart from all other nations on the face of the earth. This precept of unalienable rights is so unique and precious to freedom-loving citizens everywhere that if rightly understood and applied, it prevents those in government from infringing on the individual’s right to control their own life, liberty, and property. This is why so many from around the world have flocked to our shores, to obtain as Simeon Howard so aptly resounded in last weeks lecture, “… liberty to pursue his own happiness.”

As history has proven, the free enterprise system, based on the principle of unalienable rights as practiced in early American history, is the most productive supplier of human needs and economic justice mankind has ever known. This God ordained economic system of men keeping the fruits of their labor and controlling their life and property has produced the greatest economic prosperity for the greatest number of people.

The free enterprise system is based on blessing your fellow man and only rewards you based on how much you have blessed others. For example, let’s say you sell a cup of coffee to someone and you make a little money. The coffee you sold obviously blessed the customer more than the money you charged or they would not have made the trade. If you sell 5 cups of coffee you make a little more. If you sell 500 cups of coffee you make more still. If you sell 50,000 cups of coffee you make a good deal more. The more you sell the more people you bless and the more you are blessed. Why should anybody be upset if you are blessing others and why shouldn’t you be blessed based on how much you bless others? This is the free enterprise system in action. The free enterprise system only requires a willingness for people to work, an idea that will help others, the ability to put this idea into action, and the freedom to do so. The type of freedom needed for the free enterprise system to work is the freedom guaranteed by government as envisioned by our Founders.

This principle of government to protect the right of the individual to participate in the free enterprise system was summed up in what our Founders called a republican form of government. Therefore when Jefferson proclaimed, “The true foundation of republican government is the equal right of every citizen in his person and property, and in their management,”[6] the statist or mercantile old world and the modern politician must have thought he was crazy.

This statist or so-called progressive concept, “that it takes a village” is a failed system that has never worked because it is based on theft. The only people whom statism really works for are the ones in charge, because they live off the so-called legalized plunder of others. Under this system there is simply no incentive to work because a great deal of everything you produce is taken from you and given to others. Few people choose to work unless there is some motivation, a material incentive outside of the work itself. The desire for material reward is by far the most powerful and sustaining reason for work. In spite of our best efforts through the free enterprise system most of us will never accumulate vast wealth, nevertheless the free enterprise system, based on the philosophy of unalienable rights, is the most honest and just system mankind has ever experienced. This free enterprise system also makes it possible for some of us to enjoy the true luxuries of life and experience prosperity previously unknown to the common man. More important than that, however, it enables all the rest of us to raise our standard of living far in excess of what is possible under any other system and it is the reason why in less than 160 years America sprang up from a hostile wilderness to become the envy of the statist old world.

THE CHOICE IS OURS.

Will we work to restore our Republic to secure our unalienable rights or will we allow ourselves to degenerate into a democracy where the ever-changing will of the majority rules; where the majority constantly votes for the politician that will give them the most out of the public treasury; where the needs of the many are funded by the ability and hard work of the few. God has always called this theft. It becomes a never-ending cycle of tax and spend until all is owned and controlled by those in government, leading to totalitarianism. Government regulation is the statist pathway to totalitarian control. It destroys freedom and brings about economic chaos, oppression, and it destroys prosperity.

Let us not acquiesce to necessity being the plea for every infringement of human liberty – that appears to be the slogan of most politicians today. Many are sick and tired of hearing from the modern political pundits that the idea of “Unalienable Rights” is impractical in our modern society. This was the creed of the statist old world that our Forefathers rejected so many years ago. The free enterprise system based on the principle of unalienable rights works. As James Madison proclaimed, “Government is instituted to protect property of every sort… This being the end of government, that alone is not a just government… nor is property secure under it, where the property which a man has in his personal safety and personal liberty is violated by arbitrary seizure of one class of citizens for the service of the rest.”[7] If those who work are allowed to keep the fruit of their labor and dispense the surplus as they see fit, then they will work harder and longer. They will invest, they will invent, and they will produce more than you have ever dreamed possible. And there will be more for everyone including those that must live off the generosity of others.

The choice before us is clear. We, as individuals and churches, will either defend the American principle of Our Rights come from God – Not Government, Therefore they are not subject to the Repeal or Restrictions of Human Laws, or our current government-regulated and controlled economic system will finally destroy the economy of the most prosperous nation the world has ever known.

April 24, 2017

The election of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States was a watershed moment in American political history. Never before has an acting president been so vilified by the mainstream media while at the same time opposed by the political establishment within both parties. The Democratic Party along with establishment Republicans have resisted Trump’s every move while the main stream media nightly twists and distorts his every word.

The Trump presidency has also witnessed dramatic changes in America’s national consciousness. From the introduction of the genre of “Fake News” to allegations of Russian interference in the national election or Russian collusion with members of the Trump administration, the general public’s trust in American institutions is being eroded. The evening news contains an almost nightly display of an unending cacophony of Trump gaffes, missteps and misconceptions. If anyone seriously doubted the power of the establishment elite to resist true reform or the fraudulent bias of the mainstream media, the election of President Trump has put any such questions to rest.

On the 6th of April 2017, everything changed as the President’s decision to authorize a missile strike against Syria silenced his critics. Suddenly even the most vocal adversaries were supporting this decision. The almost unanimous support for the military strike in Syria tips the hand of the Deep State. No matter how much the liberal left or the establishment power brokers of the belt-way may have hated Trump, his military adventures in Syria have drawn almost universal praise. The establishment clearly supports military confrontation as the new American foreign policy in both the Middle East and the Korean peninsula. The only unanswered question is why.

The Syrian civil war had its origins in the 2011 Arab Spring. The six years of conflict has succeeded in destroying entire cities while uprooting millions of refuges. Now the Syrian civil war threatens to draw both superpowers into direct confrontation. On September 30th, 2015 the Russian military began air operations in support of the Assad government with a series of air strikes against both ISIS and the anti-Assad Free Syrian Army (FSA). The United States had been supplying factions of the FSA who, along with ISIS, comprise the main forces prosecuting the civil war against Syria’s Shiite government.

Elements of the FSA have been designated as “Al Qaeda affiliates by the United Nations.”[1] Both Al Qaeda and ISIS are Sunni Muslim factions with the support of US allies in the region including Saudi Arabia while Syria and its ally Iran, both Shiite states, are the allies of the Communist nations. In other words, the United States along with the UK and other NATO allies have been knowingly supporting Syrian rebel factions which are comprised of Al Qaeda and ISIS members while at the same time bombing Al Qaeda and ISIS forces in Iraq.

For the first time on Trump’s watch, the United States has become directly involved in the Syrian civil war with its attack against Assad forces following the recent chemical attack on civilians. President Trump campaigned on a non-interventionist platform that opposed the “Neo-con” militarism of the Bush era. The President had also publicly opposed military intervention in Syria by the Obama administration following the first chemical attacks against civilians in 2014. Sadly, US foreign policy is once again following the “Neo-con” agenda of Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld.

Both Russia and Iran responded declaring any further American military action in Syria would be viewed as ‘crossing a red line’ threatening military retaliation should the US intervene again. The UK’s Daily Mail reported “The Kremlin has warned the US it is ‘one step from war’ over Syria – but the Trump administration hit back by saying it would be prepared to carry out airstrikes again.”[2] Russian Prime Minister Medvedev commented: “This military action is a clear indication of the US president’s extreme dependency on the views of the Washington establishment, the one that the new president strongly criticized in his inauguration speech.”[3]

Vladimir Putin also denounced the US missile strikes as “an illegal act of aggression against a sovereign nation.”[4] In response, Putin ordered the Russian warship, the Admiral Grigorovich, to Syrian waters and promised to upgrade Syrian missile defenses. Russia also terminated its communication hot-line with US forces established to avoid any confrontation between Russian and US aircraft over Syrian airspace. Putin then made the astonishing claim that the US is planning to fake chemicals weapons attacks during a joint press conference with the Italian President Sergio Mattarella.[5]

Jeffrey Nyquist, a co-author of the book, The New Tactics of Global War , commented on the Syrian attack saying: “Russia and her allies are enemies of the US anyway. The real problem here is why would we pick a fight when our enemy is near peak strength and we have been weakened by eight years of Obama? Frankly, it’s stupid. Children are killed in half a dozen countries every day, some of them by our bombs. This maudlin declaration by the president about ‘dead babies’ is a self-misunderstanding. A few days ago one of our bombs in Iraq went awry and killed 200 civilians. Good grief! Does it matter whether a baby dies from sarin gas or from US bomb fragments? I don’t think it matters to the baby. Dead is dead. This whole thing is irrational, and our leaders need to talk sense. It’s all sickening.”[6]

Further evidence that the world is moving closer to war was reported by the UK Express on 15 April, 2017 stating that Putin has ordered “a mass mobilization of military forces in Vladivostok, Russia, just eight miles from the border with North Korea.”[7] This report comes as North Korea warned they are prepared for all-out war with the US.

Russia, Syria and Iran have issued several blunt warnings that any further air strikes in Syria would result in “grave consequences” for the United States. In the face of these heightened tensions, the United States announced plans to launch a pre-emptive strike against North Korea should it be necessary.

The world is now witnessing the final stage of pre-war preparations. The communists have always planned to use North Korea as a trip wire for war with the West. As the current tensions escalate, military experts believe that war could begin on the Korean peninsula before summer. Russia and China have also begun full scale mobilizations, and experts in Europe are now warning that a world war could come as soon as fall.

Donald Trump has warned that “North Korea is looking for trouble”, insisting that if China does not decide to help the US “will solve the problem without them.”[8] The US President made this extraordinary statement on Twitter, his warnings backed up by sending a US carrier battle group to the area.

The general public in the West assumes the United States is a lone super power and therefore can act unilaterally without serious consequence. The thought that US forces might be defeated by the communist nations is dismissed as absurd. Unfortunately, this confidence in American military supremacy is no longer based upon reality, and rather now relies upon hubris alone. The belief that the US remains the world’s lone superpower is seriously misplaced as the balance of military power has shifted dramatically over the last fifteen years only no one bothered to inform the American public. The US no longer holds a clear upper hand in today’s conventional or nuclear battlefield.

Russia and their communist allies are now armed with new 5th generation weapons including hypersonic missiles and Russia has surrounded itself with an impenetrable ABM missile shield. These new weapons have shifted the balance of power decidedly in our enemies’ favor. Russian defenses include the S-500, a dual purpose ABM and anti-aircraft missile system. This is a war winning weapon to which the US has no counter measures and which may place the US in a position of nuclear blackmail, should a conventional war erupt. To state this bluntly, Russian defensive capabilities can likely stop a US ICBM attack, while the US is defenseless against a similar Russian strike.

World War III is coming and the US is likely to suffer catastrophic losses. Deagel.com, a research group which tracks worldwide military equipment procurements, forecasts the US will suffer a population loss of 260 million along with a collapse in US GDP off 95% by 2018.[9]

The Final phase of the Overture

The communist military strategy against the West was developed over many decades of planning. The final pre-war phase is called “the overture” and includes the unveiling of former soviet spies among us as the Communists intentionally expose their own agents. This final act is designed to further demoralize the American people and destroy any remaining trust in US political institutions.

These US actors who supported the Soviet cause will be killed in the war anyway, so their final value to the communist war effort is to uncover them, and to thereby use the news as part of a final demoralization of the US public. The recent disclosure by Russian agents on Ukrainian TV that Henry Kissinger was a Soviet agent is consistent with this type of pre-war action as was the recent disclosure of Ernest Hemingway as a Soviet agent.

Russian war preparations move into final phase

We are witnessing unprecedented pre-war military moves by Russia and China. A full mobilization appears underway. Russian military officials have been stating publicly on Russian TV that nuclear war with the US is coming. Anti-American propaganda began to dominate Russian political news in earnest beginning in 2014. Preparing the domestic population for war is the first requirement according to Russian military doctrine. Mass mobilization is the final stage and appears to have started. S-400 and S-500 deployments are now occurring around Moscow.

Russian military officials recently told the Russian population they could plant nuclear warheads near the US coastline and destroy US coastal cities. Statements such as this are designed to calm down the Russian population which has become alarmed after 4 years of consistent war propaganda. At the same time, the US news is now filled daily with accusations that US officials are Putin supporters or have had inappropriate contact with Russian officials. A leading Ukraine general stated he believed Russia would attack Europe in September.

China has also begun mobilizing troops on their border with North Korea, allegedly for the purpose of adding negotiating leverage to their promise to President Trump to reign in North Korea. China doesn’t need military troops to pressure North Korea which is 100% dependent on China for critical war sustaining imports such as oil. The purpose of these troop mobilizations is more likely to join the conflict in support of North Korea at some point, or to occupy the entire peninsula at the conclusion of the war after both the South and the North have destroyed each other.

Large scale mobilizations are very expensive and not undertaken lightly. Once mobilized over this summer, Russian forces would have to either initiate conflict and invade Europe or stand down. It is not practicable for forces to dig in for a harsh winter in rural terrain. They would either stand down or be used. Standing down makes the mobilization a pointless and costly error. That is why Russian generals have made the statement – “mobilization is war.”

New US weapon developments – accelerating the push to World War

The electromagnetic rail gun under development by the US Navy can accelerate a 23 pound projectile to Mach 7 within ten milliseconds.[10] This weapon uses only magnetic force to accelerate projectiles with such velocity they don’t require explosive ordinances. It is capable of hitting targets over one hundred miles away with an impact equal to that of two million pounds moving at 100 miles per hour.[11] New super lasers are under development which can destroy incoming missiles using only thermal energy. These futuristic weapons have the potential of shifting the balance of power back to the US and are planned for operational deployment over the next few years. These weapons may eliminate virtually all of the current military advantage of Russian and Chinese forces, thus making the risk of war in the near future all the more likely.

Global nuclear war is possible by this fall

North Korea will likely be the trigger and would act as a diversionary war in the Far East drawing US forces into conflict on the Korean peninsula where they would be unable to support commitments in Europe or defend the US homeland. War in Korea could come as soon as May of 2017. A regional war in Korea would destroy much of the North and South’s military capabilities and open the door for China to occupy the entire peninsula.

The end of the Age is upon us

The opening act of the book of Revelation begins with the appearances of the four horsemen, with the first a rider on a White Horse wearing a crown and with a bow in his hands, who goes forth conquering. He is followed by a Red Horse of war which ushers in the Black Horse of global famine and total economic collapse.

Scholars have debated the meaning of these symbols for years, yet the scripture tells us the true meaning of the prophecies would be sealed up until the time of the end. That time is upon us now. The identity of the rider on the White Horse should have never been that difficult for he also lives in a White House, and the agenda which has been followed in the United States since the Bush / Clinton / Bush era has been to pursue the destabilization of the American centered world replacing it with a New World Order.

The Obama presidency was used to finish this task, reducing American military power to levels reminiscent of the pre-WWII period while placing a tombstone on the grave of America’s Christian culture. History will remember the Obama legacy as one of betrayal, setting up America for the ultimate double cross – a surprise attack by our communist ‘friends’. Now a new American president has promised to “Make America Great Again” and to restore America’s military dominance but America’s enemies want nothing of the sort.

Confronted by an America beginning to rearm itself, the communists are left with choosing between pursuing the war now or allowing America to deploy its latest military technologies which will tilt the balance of power to their disadvantage. The reason why the Deep State supports the war agenda escapes the understanding of most observers. The simple truth is the globalists who rule the shadow government “hate America” for she stands in the way of their plans for a One World government. It is for that reason they intend to “burn her cities with fire”[12] and they are about to turn loose the Red Horse of war to start the conflagration.

The true identity of the Red Horse of the book of Revelation is also quite simple. They are the “Reds” and they will start World War III which is the battle of Ezekiel 38 in Bible prophecy. It is this war that destroys the existing world order, opening the door for the One World government of the anti-Christ.

We don’t have much time left.

I will leave you with the following brilliant commentary on the continuing Communist threat from J.R. Nyquist:

“It is important (from the communist point of view) that nobody guess the actual situation, that nobody see how far the subversion has gone, or how powerful the communist side has become. While Obama was US President an identical circumstance played out in Washington as in Moscow. In both capitals the communists were depicted as an inconsiderable and irrelevant minority. In reality, the presidents of both countries were committed communists. The levers of power were in their hands, and the world suspected nothing. While Obama worked to disarm the United States, Putin worked to rearm Russia. While Obama undercut our allies abroad, Putin invaded Crimea and intervened in the Middle East. As the danger grew, as Hillary Clinton was sure to be the next and final president, the collaboration between Washington and Moscow was guaranteed to result in America’s defeat.

“But then a miracle happened. Donald Trump was elected president; a man of impeccable nationalist instinct, of remarkable courage in the face of the enemy. The communists were aghast at his victory. And so, strange as it seems, they decided on a preposterous fraud. While they posed as Russia’s enemies, Donald Trump would be depicted as Russia’s friend.

“For the leading communists to deny their communist affiliation was a preliminary strategic step in both Washington and Moscow. Freed from the label of what they had actually been, the communists were able to advance without opposition from those annoying anti-communists. And now they are compelled by the logic of their false position to paint the ‘patriotic American’ (Donald Trump) as Russia’s puppet. Here the real puppet points to the man and declares that he is the puppet. It is a history-making deception. It is grand and it is bold. It cynically estimates the ignorance of the populace, the corruption of the political class, and the willing treachery of the media. It relies on the fact that the smartest strategists and analysts on the American side have been sidelined or murdered. So there is nobody to call out the truth.

“Who now dares say the truth about what has happened in this country? Anyone writing in this vein is committing career suicide. Therefore, only someone without a career would dare to write along these lines at all! Even then it means being assigned to a death list, like Anna Politkovskaya and Alexander Litvinenko. (You want a successful career? You want to live? Sing the tune that is assigned. Play a role out of the communist script. You can be a conservative if you wish, but you will be Moscow’s conservative.)

“Of course, you probably think I am crazy. You think communism went away in 1991. You think that communism no longer exists. But then you will have to explain how we got here – with communist thugs using open intimidation on the streets of our cities! If communism lost the Cold War, why does it presently hold such power in government agencies, universities and newspapers? Why do you think US counterintelligence is spying on the President of the United States and his staff? Who wants to bring him down? You need to explain all the variable phenomena of today: from the communist-inspired economic sabotage of global warming ‘science’ to the insistence that our border remain a sieve. It is only our enemies who stand to gain from these policies.

“But you cannot get over this idea; namely, that communism is dead. You saw it die on TV. How can we talk once again about Marxism-Leninism? Or as an Estonian presidential candidate once asked in response to my discourse: ‘What’s Marxism-Leninism?’ His pained expression relayed the idea that Marxism-Leninism was something that didn’t really exist. Nobody believed in it, so why did it matter? Even the communists don’t believe in communism anymore. It’s as simple as that! Any idiot who tells you that there are true-believing communists should wear a dunce cap. Russia a democracy. China is capitalist. Cuba is an open society with superb health care. And that nice little North Korean man is a champion of world peace!

“So where did all the communists go? Did they simply revert to Christianity? Did they become Scientologists? Stop and think for a moment. You control half the planet and you’ve been fooling people in every country for decades. And what do you do for an encore? You fall off the edge of the flat earth! Well, I guess they topped themselves after all. And then, twenty-five years later, suddenly, you discover they have taken over your child’s mind and sent him into the street to beat up an old displaced factory worker wearing a hat which says, ‘Make America Great Again.’ You have the CIA and FBI spying on the President of the United States to the advantage of change agents. And Congress is dragging its feet on Trump’s cabinet nominees because they’ve been honey-trapped by the Satanic Pedophile communist zombie apocalypse. It is real Satanism, real pedophilia, real undead communists, and a real apocalypse.

“Have you ever seen the movie Invasion of the Body Snatchers? It’s an allegorical fiction about a communist takeover. Well, we’re living it. In fact, the pod people are attempting to convince the world that they are the ones fighting the alien invasion! This lie is repeated on every news channel. And you might easily believe them: First, because you did not understand who the enemy was. Second, because you don’t believe in pod people. Third, because you voted pod people into the White House in 1992, 1996, 2008 and 2012. And when the pod people finally colonized your government and rotted out your nuclear arsenal, the old pod president didn’t go back to Illinois. He remained in Washington to command the pod-people army inside the federal government, while Mr. Trump erroneously believes himself to be in charge.

“So they don’t believe in Marxism-Leninism anymore? So why do we have socialized medicine? And why does Vladimir Lenin, who died in 1924, lie calmly with his eyes closed in his mausoleum on Red Square – not buried in a grave with a stone marker? No doubt, he is kept on display in Moscow because ‘nobody there believes in him anymore’! It’s a funny kind of not-believing in someone, don’t you think?

“Nobody in Moscow believes in communism! They refuse to bury Lenin because he makes a nice tourist attraction. And besides, Vladimir Putin wears a cross and says he believes in God. (Well, he doesn’t really like to talk about it. But we think he believes in God.) And so, at the end of the day, we are all Kremlin puppets. We are all bouncing helplessly at the end of Moscow’s string. Even now the puppet-master appears to be at odds with his most secret creatures – the moles at CIA and FBI! Appearances notwithstanding, the puppeteer must always hide the puppet’s strings. This he accomplishes by a diversion in which he calls the man (Trump) a puppet and the puppet (Obama) he calls a man. And so, as well, he calls his friend enemy and his enemy he calls friend.

“If President Trump could read one paragraph of this scribbling, I would wish that he read this last paragraph. Then he might understand, in an instant, who his enemies are – both foreign and domestic. And I say, that enemy is not an opponent, not a competitor, not a business rival. No, no. I mean – an enemy! And once our president can tell friend from foe, his strategic compass will align to true north and half the battle will be won.”[13]

The following excerpts from Yates’ famous poem, The Second Coming , perhaps capture our time best:

“Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;

Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,

The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere

The ceremony of innocence is drowned;

The best lack all conviction, while the worst

Are full of passionate intensity…

Surely some revelation is at hand;

Surely the Second Coming is at hand…

The darkness drops again but now I know

That twenty centuries of stony sleep

Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,

And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,

Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?”[14]

By NWV Senior Political News Writer, Jim Kouri

On Thursday a nonpartisan, nonprofit government watchdog group sent a warning letter to Acting FBI Director Andrew G. McCabe reminding him of the FBI’s responsibility to follow the law stipulated by the Federal Records Act (FRA) to recover records — including memos Comey admitted under oath that he intentionally leaked to the media.

The FRA, a law which originally went into effect in 1950 and was amended by President Barack Obama in 2014, makes the removal of documents from the Bureau by former FBI Director James Comey an unlawful act.

Comey who was canned by President Donald Trump, appeared in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee on last week and made some statement against former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, former President Barack Obama, the New York Times — which he said published “fake news” stories — and complained about the handling of the Hillary Clinton email brouhaha.

Comey also admitted he gave a confidential document about his meeting with President Donald Trump to a “friend” who then gave it to the New York Times, an admitted Trump-hating publication.

. The letter from watchdog group Judicial Watch’s President Tom Fitton states:

“As you are well aware, former FBI Director James Comey gave sworn testimony last week before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Among other things, Mr. Comey confirmed that, while in office, he created various memoranda regarding his meetings with President Trump. Mr. Comey also confirmed that, after his departure from the FBI, he provided at least some of these memoranda to a third party, Columbia Law School Professor Daniel Richman, for the purpose of leaking them to the press. Various media outlets now have reported that Professor Richman has provided these memoranda to the FBI. It is unclear whether he still retains copies of the memoranda.

“I am writing to you on behalf of Judicial Watch, Inc., a not-for-profit educational organization that seeks to promote transparency, accountability, and integrity in government and fidelity to the rule of law. In furtherance of its public interest mission, Judicial Watch regularly requests access to the records of the FBI through the Freedom of Information Act and disseminates its findings to the public. In fact, on May 16, 2017, Judicial Watch submitted a FOIA request seeking these specific memoranda removed from the FBI by Mr. Comey. Judicial Watch also has pending FOIA lawsuits in which the memoranda may be at issue.

“These memoranda were created by Mr. Comey while serving as FBI director, were written on his FBI laptop, and concerned official government business. As such, they indisputably are records subject to the Federal Records Act. 44 U.S.C. §§ 2101-18, 2901-09, 3101-07, and 3301-14. The fact that Mr. Comey removed these memoranda from the FBI upon his departure, apparently for the purpose of subsequently leaking them to the press, confirms the FBI’s failure to retain and properly manage its records in accordance with the Federal Records Act. Even if Mr. Comey no longer has possession of these particular memoranda, as he now claims, some or all of these memoranda may still be in possession of a third party, such as Professor Richman, and must be recovered. Mr. Comey’s removal of these memoranda also suggests that other records may have been removed by Mr. Comey and may remain in his possession or in the possession of others. If so, these records must be recovered by the FBI as well.

“As you may be aware, the Federal Records Act imposes a direct responsibility on you to take steps to recover any records unlawfully removed from the FBI. Specifically, upon learning of “any actual, impending, or threatened unlawful removal, defacing, alteration, corruption, deletion, erasure, or other destruction of records in the custody of the agency,” you must notify the Archivist of the United States. 44 U.S.C. § 3106. Upon learning that records have been unlawfully removed from the FBI, you then are required to initiate action through the Attorney General for the recovery of records. Id.

“In the event you fail to take these steps, you should be aware that Judicial Watch is authorized under the law to file a lawsuit in federal district court seeking that you be compelled to comply with the law. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Kerry, 844 F.3d 952, 955 (D.C. Cir. 2016); Armstrong v. Bush, 924 F.2d 282,296 (D.C. Cir. 1991). Please advise us no later than June 26, 2017 if you intend to take the action required under the law. If we do not hear from you by that date, we will assume that you do not intend to take any action. Thank you for your attention to this matter.”

“[Director] Comey took government records and the FBI and Justice Department are obligated to get them back. The former FBI director isn’t above the law and current leadership of the FBI should stop protecting him and take action,” Tom Fitton noted in a press statement.

Fitton’s team of attorneys and investigations — such of Judicial Watch’s Chief of Investigations Chris Farrell — are currently pursuing a lawsuit against the U.S. State Department for failing to take proper action to retrieve emails written or received by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other employees which were unlawfully removed from the State Department. Judicial Watch’s legal argument is that the State Department and FBI never even bothered to undergo a full and complete search for Hillary Clinton’s government emails.

This is one of several of Judicial Watch’s FOIA lawsuits seeking government records and information about the non-government email system used by Clinton. Her email system transmitted and received classified information but the Obama administration allowed her to skate, although she did lose the presidential election.

Winter weight gain often feels inevitable—the effects of overdoing it during an ever-growing holiday season. The colder, shorter days make it harder to get outdoors and easier to stay glued to the TV. It may seem easier to say bah humbug and decline every party invitation, instead staying tied to the treadmill.

The good news: The 10 pounds the average American is alleged to gain between Thanksgiving and New Years Day is only a myth. A National Institutes of Health study in 2000 tested this theory by measuring the weights of 195 volunteers before, during, and after the six-week holiday season. What they found was that the average weight gain was only about one pound. One pound!

And whether it’s one pound or a few that you’ve packed on this year, you can still lose weight during the cold winter months. The results of the study concluded that there were two controllable factors that influenced those who gained five or more pounds and those who didn’t. People that kept moving and kept their hunger levels in check succeeded in staying true to their weight loss goals. Ready to bust the myth of winter weight gain? Here’s how.

1. Shorten your session. You shouldn’t skip a workout for a party or a snow day but you can do a shorter sweat session. Also you can try quick workouts you can easily do at home in less than 20 minutes.

2. Use colder weather and shorter days to try out new indoor activities. Martial arts, indoor rock walls, and hot yoga are fun ways to move and stay warm.

3. Wear your activity tracker every day. Maybe you’ve been inconsistent with wearing it lately, but wintertime is an ideal time to for usage. If you can’t get a workout in, focus on getting 10,00 steps a day.

4. More moving, less eating for holiday fun. Caroling or ice-skating with friends are great alternatives to cookie exchanges and cocktail parties. You can still celebrate afterward with a cup of homemade hot chocolate.

5. Pack your plate with protein. It keeps you feeling full longer and helps stabilize blood sugar levels. Even snacks should have at least 10 grams of protein.

6. Always have a glass of water or hot tea in your hand. Research suggests the some 75 percent of Americans may be chronically dehydrated and we often mistake dehydration for hunger. Diligent water consumption can curb snacking for the wrong reasons and boost energy.

7. Be carb smart. Carbs are not the enemy. You can eat bread and pasta, but quality, quantity, and timing are key. Carbs that satiate, like vegetables, or those with protein and fiber, like beans and dairy, should be the bulk of your intake. You can have bread, pasta, and rice (starchy carbs) after a workout, when your body can best use them.

8. Don’t skip meals. The worst thing you can do is to go to a holiday meal or party starving. When you arrive hungry everything looks good, despite your best intention to “enjoy in moderation.” Eat normally throughout the day so you have willpower to only enjoy one slice of grandma’s pecan pie.

Trump Tweet Unites a Bewildered Nation,[],"WASHINGTON — And on the 132nd day, just after midnight, President Trump had at last delivered the nation to something approaching unity — in bewilderment, if nothing else.

The state of our union was … covfefe.

The trouble began, as it so often does, on Twitter, in the early minutes of Wednesday morning. Mr. Trump had something to say. Kind of.

“Despite the constant negative press covfefe,” the tweet began, at 12:06 a.m., from @realDonaldTrump, the irrepressible internal monologue of his presidency.

And that was that.

A minute passed. Then another. Then five.

Processed meats have enjoyed a terrible reputation among cardiologists pretty much since we figured out what that thumping thing in the middle of our chests was. And that’s not for nothing — that category of foods (which includes bacon, ham, and hot dogs) has been proven to increase your risk of heart failure. But contrary to popular belief, Etherton says bacon isn’t the worst of the bunch. Sausage has a slight edge due to its higher saturated fat content, so you can feel marginally better about ordering a side of bacon strips over a side of sausage links for breakfast.

Red meats (plus pork!)

This is another case where people rag on it for a reason. Red meats have a considerable amount of cholesterol and saturated fat, as well as another terror called L-carnitine, which is why they make your doctor so nervous. Pros like Etherton advise patients to limit lean red meats to less than 10% of their average diet to play it safe, and don’t think you can get away with replacing your porterhouse with a pork chop. “A lot of people say pork isn’t red, so you’re okay,” Etherton says. “But it still has a lot of saturated fat, so you need to limit it as you would any red meat.”"
401,http://www.nephef.com/richard-gere-blasts-trump-immigration-policy-must-embrace-love/,nephef,Richard Gere Blasts Trump Immigration Policy: We Must ‘Embrace and Love’ Each Other,[],"Actor Richard Gere weighed in on President Donald Trump’s recent executive action on immigration Friday at the Berlin International Film Festival, where he blasted the president’s decision to temporarily prohibit immigration from some countries and accused him of being a leader who “stimulates fear.”

The 67-year-old actor — in town for the premiere of his latest film, The Dinner — called for unity, even as he reportedly said he wouldn’t attend a hypothetical dinner with President Trump.

“The number of hate crimes went up enormously as soon as Donald Trump started running for president, in the United States and in Europe,” Gere told an audience at the festival, according to Deadline.

He continued:

“Unfortunately, we have leaders that stimulate fear, and that fear causes us to do really terrible things. I think that’s part of what we’re talking about in the film. We have to be really careful how we talk to each other and characterize each other. The most horrible thing Trump has done is conflate the terms refugee and terrorist. It means the same thing in the U.S. now. A refugee used to be someone who you had empathy for, who you wanted to help and give refuge to. Now we’re afraid of them. We have to really understand what he and this conservative movement has done and not forget we’re all in this together. We can’t escape each other’s realities. We have to embrace each other and love each other.”

In The Dinner, Gere plays ambitious politician Stan Lohman, who — together with his wife (Rebecca Hall), brother (Steve Coogan) and his brother’s wife (Laura Linney) — must decide what to do when their children are caught up in a heinous, race-related crime.

At the panel for the film, Coogan also got in a jab at Trump when he was asked whether his character, Paul Lohman, suffers from mental illness: “Yes, he does have a mental illness. But compared with the president of the United States, it looks like a mild headache.”

The 67th annual Berlinale kicked off this week and runs until February 18. The Dinner will compete with 17 other films for the festival’s top Golden Bear prize.

And that is so because people in today’s modern lifestyle do not have a lot of free time to exercise or eat properly and healthy and there are many foods today that are delicious but really unhealthy.

404,http://www.nephef.com/dhs-secretary-donald-trump-working-streamlined-travel-ban/,nephef,DHS Secretary: Donald Trump working on a ‘streamlined’ travel ban,[],"President Donald Trump is working on a “streamlined” version of his executive order banning travel from seven predominantly Muslim nations to iron out the difficulties that landed his first order in the courts, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said.

Speaking on a panel on Saturday (local time) at the Munich Security Conference about combating terrorism, Kelly said Trump’s original order was designed as a “temporary pause” to allow him to “see where our immigration and vetting system has gaps – and gaps it has – that could be exploited”.

He said the Trump administration was surprised when U.S. courts blocked it from implementing the executive order and now “the president is contemplating releasing a tighter, more streamlined version” of the travel ban.

Kelly said this next time he will be able to “make sure that there’s no one caught in the system of moving from overseas to our airports”.

Asked whether that meant Trump’s new executive order would allow people with green cards and visas to come into the United States, Kelly said “it’s a good assumption”.

But he went on to say that only people with visas who were already in transit would be allowed in. For others, he said, “we will have a short phase-in period to make sure that people on the other end don’t get on airplanes”.

He did not elaborate on whether this would apply to green card holders as well.

Among the security challenges, Kelly said, was that the U.S. does not have “strong counter-terrorism partnerships” with the countries in question or “robust information on individuals travelling from these countries” to be able to make a good risk assessments before their citizens travelled to the United States.

The nations affected by the original ban were Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Kelly mentioned “seven nations” again on Saturday, leading to speculation they will all be included in Trump’s next executive order.

The U.S. needs to “find ways to vet in a more reliable way to satisfy us that the people that are coming to the United States are, in fact, coming for the right reasons,” he said.

Asked about the effectiveness of a blanket ban on seven countries, fellow panelist Thomas de Maiziere, Germany’s top security official, suggested it could be counter-productive.

“To ban whole countries perhaps could create more collateral damage, and perhaps does not produce more security,” he said. “The more precise you do it, the more effective you are.”

405,http://www.nephef.com/trump-may-affirm-special-relationship-us-uk/,nephef,"Trump, May affirm special relationship between US, UK",[],"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May appeared chummy as they faced a curious world together for the first time Friday, pledging allegiance to the special relationship between their countries while trying to mask stark differences on some major issues.

It was Trump’s first White House meeting with a foreign head of state, a hastily arranged confab held precisely one week after the businessman and reality TV star, who remains a largely unknown figure to European audiences, was sworn into office as president.

Trump sought to charm May from the outset, showing her the bust of Prime Minister Winston Churchill that he’s using to decorate the Oval Office. He then opened a joint news conference by noting that his late mother was born in “Stornoway, which is serious Scotland.” Scotland is part of Great Britain.

Trump and May were seen briefly holding hands as they walked along the White House colonnade after leaving the Oval Office. Their talks continued in the State Dining Room over lunch of iceberg wedge salad, braised beef short ribs with potato puree and salted caramel crème brulee.

For her part, May congratulated Trump on his “stunning election victory,” and announced that he had accepted the queen’s invitation for a state visit with his wife, first lady Melania Trump, later this year.

But the attempts at mutual flattery didn’t completely mask the leaders’ differences over some issues, including NATO and Russia.

May tried to push Trump toward positions she supports, noting that he had assured her he was “100 percent” behind NATO, a world body he has dismissed as “obsolete.” Trump did not contradict May as they stood together and answered journalists’ questions in the White House East Room.

May also took a tougher stance on sanctions against Russia.

When asked how close the U.S. is to lifting penalties that were imposed on Russia after its incursion into Ukraine, Trump said it was “very early to be talking about that.” May said sanctions should remain until a 2015 cease-fire agreement for Ukraine is fully implemented.

Trump has been less critical of Russia and its leader, President Vladimir Putin, than his predecessor and some lawmakers, including fellow Republicans. He has cast doubt on findings by U.S. intelligence officials that Russia interfered in the presidential election to help him win the White House, and has praised Putin’s leadership. Trump’s stance has fueled speculation that he could ease or remove the sanctions against Russia.

Trump also reiterated his belief that torture works. Britain takes a vocal stand against it.

The appearance alongside May was more amiable than Trump’s most recent public appearance with a foreign leader: a joint news conference with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto last August. Trump was more staid and serious then, and read from lengthy prepared remarks.

Coincidentally, Trump and May met a day after Pena Nieto canceled his own trip to Washington next week amid disagreement with Trump over which of their countries will pay for the wall Trump wants to build along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump says Mexico will pay; Mexico says it won’t.

Trump is somewhat of a mystery to world leaders, many of whom expected Democrat Hillary Clinton to win the election. They also don’t know his administration’s main interlocutors with foreign governments, including son-in-law Jared Kushner and senior adviser Steve Bannon, a conservative media executive.

So May was on a bit of a scouting mission.

She has strong reasons for wanting the relationship to work. Britain is set to leave the European Union and its 500 million-person single market, and is eager for a bilateral trade deal with the U.S. The United States is Britain’s biggest export market, and such a trade deal would be a major prize.

Trump has drawn parallels between Britain’s choice to leave the EU and his own success, using the Brexit vote last June to bolster his derision of the 28-nation bloc and his preference for striking bilateral agreements.

Often combative in the presence of journalists, Trump seemed relaxed and humorous alongside May. At one point, after a British journalist asked whether people should be alarmed by his past statements, Trump joked: “This was your choice of a question? There goes that relationship.”

He backed May’s determination to make Britain strong and prosperous once it leaves the European Union, saying he thought Brexit would be “a tremendous asset and not a tremendous liability.”

And when asked whether the two very different leaders had found common ground, Trump said they had.

“I think we’re going to get along very well,” he said. “I am a people person. I think you are also, Theresa.”"

Thousands of people participated in the movement across the country, including people in Middle Tennessee.

In Nolensville, nearly 20 employees at Bradley Coatings, Incorporated told their supervisors on Wednesday they’d be taking part as well. Then, on Thursday they were told they no longer had jobs.

“We are the team leaders directly under the supervisors and they informed us last night that we could not go back to work and the boss said we were fired,” one employee told us.

The former employee asked to remain anonymous but had this message to his former boss.

“I would tell him he was unfair, after working for them for so many years, gave him our best. They could not understand that it was just one day. We were going to make up that day on a Sunday, but they didn’t understand that, and it was not the best way. They didn’t give us an opportunity and just told us we were fired,” he said.

“Tennessee is an employment-at-will state which basically means an employer can end your employment at any time without reason or cause. Of course, there are a lot of different stipulations, civil rights issues that could stop them from doing that,” Department of Labor and Workforce Development spokesman, Chris Cannon said.

Bradley Coatings, Inc.’s attorney released the following statement:

“Bradley Coatings, Incorporated (BCI) is a family-owned, Nashville-based business that provides commercial painting services to its clients on a very demanding schedule. Established in 1986, BCI has always celebrated diversity and supported the immigrant community. This past Wednesday night, certain employees of BCI informed their leadership that they would not be at work the following day. Because of the time-sensitive nature of the jobs these employees were assigned to, all employees were told that they would need to show up for work or they would be terminated. On Thursday, the majority of BCI’s employees fulfilled their obligations to our clients, but eighteen employees did not. Regretfully, and consistent with its prior communication to all its employees, BCI had no choice but to terminate these individuals. The reason these employees missed work—to engage in peaceful demonstrations—had nothing to do with BCI’s decision to terminate them. BCI regrets this situation, but it has contracted with its clients to complete work on a schedule set by the client’s general contractor. BCI will review its procedures in an effort to avoid similar issues in the future, and will continue to provide timely service to its clients and support to the Nashville immigrant community.” – Robert Peal, Company Attorney

410,http://www.nephef.com/trying-lose-weight-winter-5-tips-can-help/#mh-comments,nephef,Trying To Lose Weight This Winter? These 5 Tips Can Help,[],"Come New Years Day, most people kick into high gear, choose a new diet plan, pay for a gym membership, and do their best to transform their body. And most people, despite their best intentions, will struggle through the winter to lose the weight and keep it off.

What they don’t know is that winter weight loss requires a very different set of foods and behaviors than dieting in warmer months.

The best kept secret about proper winter weight loss?

You can cleanse your organs, boost your energy, and drop the weight in a holistic, natural way that reconnects you to your best guide: your body.

Most cleanses, diets, and detox plans focus on freshly pressed vegetable juices, fruits, salads, and raw foods that are actually too cooling for the body in cold winter months.

The human body has evolved with the seasons to eat heavily in the fall harvest season and keep weight on the winter to protect from the cold and lack of food. If you’ve tried a juice cleanse in the winter before, you’ll know what I mean.

We naturally crave warming soups, cooked foods, and the fats to protect our organs and skin from biting winds, freezing temperature, and less sunlight. A well-planned winter weight loss cleanse will help you feel strong and warm, and help you drop the extra pounds without leaving your frail and cold.

Here are my tops tips for cleansing in winter:

1. Eat for warmth.

When you’re physically cold, what sounds better: a chilled salad or a bowl of soup? See, you actually know your body better than you may think. Focus on the seasonal, local foods that grow near your home. For most of us, that means eating more naturally sweet, dense root vegetables, hearty winter greens, and quality animal products. Warming spices and herbs may also be used to ground and sustain your energy. Try my Warming Winter Cleanse Broth recipe below.

2. Focus on fats that trim.

Did you know your body needs the right kind of fats to help absorb important nutrients from food as well as lose weight? True story. Healthy fats help your body soak up vitamins A, D and E, and are necessary for a healthy nervous system. That also means when you eat the right fats, your mood is better.

Stock up on a variety of monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and the right saturated fats this winter, but avoid hydrogenated and trans fats that lurk in processed foods. Try olives, olive oil, almonds, avocados, salmon, walnuts, anchovies, flax seeds, hemp seeds, grass-fed butter, organic clarified butter, and unrefined coconut oil.

In fact, studies show that eating two tablespoons of unrefined coconut oil, rich in medium-chain-fatty-acids, with meals can boost body temperature and metabolism, helping to avoid the metabolic slow-down associated with winter dieting.

3. Savor sweets that slim.

Refined sugars and carbohydrates cause most obesity and heart disease, not fat. But we still crave sweet! This winter, eat a variety of naturally sweet, high-nutrient, seasonal vegetables to give you the sweet taste, satisfaction, and grounded, cozy energy you desire. Roast beets, bake sweet potatoes, and steam winter pumpkins and squash for their vitamins and mild natural sweetness, and it will be much easier to mute sugar’s siren call.

4. Sleep.

When the weather is cold, and the day is short, human bodies return to the natural, evolved state of slow metabolism and more sleep. Get more sleep during the early, dark evening hours, and wake up earlier to catch every ray of sunlight possible. When you wake up early and get more morning sunlight, it has a positive effect on your sleep cycle. More sleep before midnight, especially in winter, helps your mood stay stable, stops you from midnight snacking, and improves the quality of your sleep.

5. Enjoy a Warming Winter Cleansing Broth (Recipe)

Here is one of my best, mineral- and nutrient-rich, warming broths that you’ll love this winter.

Ingredients:

2 small or medium yellow onions, halved

5 stalks of celery, with leaves, roughly chopped

2 large carrots, roughly chopped

One large leek, roughly chopped

One large bunch of kale or bok choy, roughly chopped

2 parsnips, roughly chopped

2 large pieces of kombu or kelp sea vegetables

1 cup shiitake mushrooms, cleaned

2 inches fresh ginger, roughly chopped

3 cloves garlic, peeled and roughly chopped

Preparation

1. Combine all in a large pot and cover with enough cold, filtered water to cover.

2. Bring to a boil. Lower heat to a simmer with the lid on for one hour.

3. Turn off the heat, give your broth time to cool to a point where you can comfortably handle it, then strain through a fine meshed strainer. You can use a large spoon or spatula to squeeze liquid and nutrients out of soft veggies.

4. Be sure not to transfer hot broth to a glass container, but this broth can be refrigerated for a week in sealed glass jars.

The lady lifts her leg up and lays it on her man’s shoulder. The man later penetrates and wrap his hands around the woman’s leg. The advantage of this position is that both the man and lady get the chance to move and keep up the pace

3. The Butterfly





The adjusted preacher as we can call. The lady rests both her legs on the man’s shoulder and the man enters her keeping up a profound push and the movement. Both the accomplices are up close and personal. The lady can even raise her hips for a more profound infiltration. Utilize a cushion in the event that you need, for support

We know you women love to stay in control and this position provide them complete control over the movement. It is also known as the reverse missionary position. And what could be better but to be able to see your man moan and feel his shoulders close?

5. On the lap.

To do this to a great degree tiring position, the man needs to sit upright on the bed head or a couch. The lady then climbs on sitting in his lap, consequently being infiltrated profoundly. The lady can take control of the circumstance nd have a stunning knowledge.

An advanced variation of the missionary. Instead of the woman’s legs on the the bed, she places them in the air or even sometimes on the man’s shoulder. This position is evil and perfection because it gives the deepest penetration and allows te penis to hit the G- spot just right.

414,http://www.nephef.com/trump-will-withdraw-u-s-paris-climate-agreement/,nephef,Trump Will Withdraw U.S. From Paris Climate Agreement,[],"Mr. Trump said that the United States will immediately “cease all implementation of the nonbinding Paris accord” and what he said were “draconian financial” and other burdens imposed on the country by the accord.

In his remarks, Mr. Trump listed sectors of the United States economy that would suffer lost revenues and jobs if the country remained part of the accord, citing a study — disputed vigorously by environmental groups — that claims the agreement would cost 2.7 million jobs by 2025.

Mr. Obama, in a rare assertion of his political views as a former president, castigated the decision.

“The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created,” he said in a statement. “I believe the United States of America should be at the front of the pack. But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I’m confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we’ve got.”

Most Republicans applauded the decision.

“I applaud President Trump and his administration for dealing yet another significant blow to the Obama administration’s assault on domestic energy production and jobs,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader.

Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, said, “The Paris climate agreement set unworkable targets that put America at a competitive disadvantage with other countries and would have raised energy costs for working families.”

But Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, tweeted, “Climate change requires a global approach. I’m disappointed in the President’s decision.”

In recent days, Mr. Trump withstood withering criticism from European counterparts who accused him of shirking America’s role as a global leader and America’s responsibility as the world’s second largest emitter of planet-warming greenhouse gasses. And he shrugged aside pleas from executives of the United States’ largest companies, who said the decision will damage the environment and hamper their efforts to compete around the world.

Mr. Trump also found himself at the center of a bruising, monthslong debate inside the White House that pitted senior members of his staff against each other. Some argued to leave the Paris agreement and others insisted that the United States should remain, even as the administration dismantles pollution standards.

The president’s decision was a victory for Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, and Scott Pruitt, his Environmental Protection Agency administrator, both of whom had argued forcefully to abandon the global agreement in favor of a clean break that would clear the way for a new environmental approach.

Other top aides, including Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council; the president’s daughter, Ivanka Trump; and his secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, had insisted to Mr. Trump that remaining a part of the agreement would have allowed the United States to eviscerate Obama-era climate rules without as much damage to relations with other countries.

After the fierce debate of the past weeks, the White House took on the trappings of a celebration. The Rose Garden was packed with reporters, activists and members of Mr. Trump’s administration, who waited in at the hot sun for the president’s announcement. Scores of staff members lined the sides of the Rose Garden as a military band played soft jazz.

Supporters of the Paris agreements reacted with pent-up alarm, condemning the administration for shortsightedness about the planet and a reckless willingness to shatter longstanding diplomatic relationships.

“This is disgraceful,” said Annie Leonard, Greenpeace USA’s executive director. “By withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement, the Trump administration has turned America from a global climate leader into a global climate deadbeat.”

Kierán Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, said, “Trump just confirmed his total contempt for our planet’s future,” condemning “this reckless rejection of international climate cooperation” that was “turning our country into a rogue nation.”

Corporate leaders also condemned Mr. Trump’s action. In a statement on its website, I.B.M. reaffirmed its support for the Paris agreement and took issue with the president’s contention that it is a bad deal for American workers and the American economy.

“This agreement requires all participating countries to put forward their best efforts on climate change as determined by each country,” the company said in the statement. “IBM believes that it is easier to lead outcomes by being at the table, as a participant in the agreement, rather than from outside it.”

Jeff Immelt, chairman and chief executive of General Electric, took to Twitter to say he was “disappointed with today’s decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government.”

But Mr. Trump was resolute.

“It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Mich., and Pittsburgh, Pa., along with many, many other locations within our great country before Paris, France,” he said. “It is time to make America great again.”

Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto responded on Twitter, “I can assure you that we will follow the guidelines of the Paris Agreement for our people, our economy & future.”

What it should prove is that Trump is neither willing nor able to change his stripes. He is a 70-year-old man (he will be 71 on June 14) who has had much success in his life. And he believes that the way in which he was elected president — against all odds and doing everything traditional politics says not to — is an affirmation that he is the only person who really understands his supporters and the mood of the country.

That assumption is what leads him to ignore advice from advisers about, maybe just maybe, putting down his phone at, say, 10 p.m. — or never picking it up at all. Trump believes in Trump — first, last and always.

Staff will come and go. But to expect anyone to change Trump in any way is to ignore, literally, his entire adult life.

Which means more “covfefes.” Maybe many more.

Time and time again, Republican elected officials have politely suggested that Trump use Twitter less and differently. Use it to rally his massive online support base behind policy initiatives rather than as a tool to exact revenge on people Trump thinks have wronged him. White House staffers have done the same, occasionally floating the idea that, at one point or another, Trump finally “got it” and was going to tweet differently from there on out.

416,http://www.nephef.com/donald-trump-attacks-fbi-director-james-comey-testifies-russia-investigation/,nephef,Donald Trump attacks FBI director James Comey before he testifies on Russia investigation,[],"Donald Trump has attacked the director of the FBI before he gives testimony on a probe into links between the President’s campaign team and Russia.

James Comey is to outline results of a months-long investigation into potential coordination with the Kremlin publicly before members of Congress, although any information is expected to be heavily restricted.

Mr Trump has repeatedly denied the Kremlin played a role in his shock election victory and took to Twitter to launch a new attack late on Tuesday.

“FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds!” he wrote.

“The phony Trump/Russia story was an excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign?”

The President appeared to be referring to a probe into Ms Clinton’s use of her family’s private email server for official communications, which prompted an investigation into alleged violations of federal laws and State Department protocol.

Mr Comey recommended no charges be filed in July, effectively closing the case, but then announced an investigation into newly discovered emails on 28 October.

Mr Trump seized on the probe, calling his rival “crooked Hillary” and leading chants of “lock her up” at rallies as he lagged in polls, and it has been partly credited with his election victory despite closing two days before the vote.

Speaking at the Women for Women International’s annual lunch in New York on Tuesday, Ms Clinton said she took responsibility for her election loss but believes the FBI investigation played a key part.

“If the election had been on 27 October, I would be your President,” the former Secretary of State said, adding that she was “on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey’s letter and Russian WikiLeaks [Democratic email leaks] raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off”.

Ms Clinton also said misogyny ”played a role in this election”, conceding she made mistakes but concluding: “The reason I believe we lost were the intervening events in the last 10 days.”

The FBI and Congressional committees are now investigating alleged Russian interference in the vote after a US intelligence report concluded that “Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign” to damage Ms Clinton’s chances and undermine faith in the democratic process.

“We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump,” said the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

Analysts say details are unlikely to be released as counterintelligence investigations rarely end with criminal charges and court proceedings, although House and Senate committees have been holding public hearings and could publicise their findings.

Last week, congressional officials said Michael Flynn, Mr Trump’s first national security adviser, appeared to violate federal law when he failed to seek permission or inform the US government about accepting tens of thousands of dollars from Russian organisations after a trip there in 2015.

Mr Comey will be testifying publicly before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and is due to speak behind closed doors to a House committee on Thursday, after claiming he wants to be “transparent” when it comes to discussing foreign meddling in American politics.

Sally Yates, the former Acting Attorney General who was dismissed for refusing to back Mr Trump’s attempted “Muslim ban”, is due to testify before the Senate panel next week.

She will say she warned the White House over Mr Flynn’s discussions with the Russian ambassador three weeks before he was fired, CNN reported.

The allegations are among several issues driving worsening relations between Russia and the West, as well as the wars in Syria and Ukraine.

Mr Putin dismissed accusations of aiding Mr Trump’s campaign as unproven “rumours” used for internal politics during a tense press conference with Angela Merkel on Tuesday.

“We never interfere in other countries’ politics and we want no one to meddle in ours,” the Russian President said.

“Unfortunately, we have seen the opposite happening for years. We have seen attempts to influence political processes in Russia through the so-called NGOs and directly.

“Realising the futility of such efforts, it has never occurred to us to interfere.”

They say immigrants fall in love with America because of opportunity. I fell in love with it because of accessibility.

As a young father, moving to America wasn’t something I was considering when I first visited Chicago. In Pakistan, I had a fancier car, a nicer home, and a solid support network of extended family and friends. My wife and I were happy, and looked forward to a good future for our children.

But walking around Chicago, I kept noticing that the sidewalks would sometimes become small, smoothly paved ramps.

I couldn’t understand why, until I asked one of my friends who had been living in the city for a few years. It’s to give access to those in a wheelchair, he explained. It’s so they can cross streets and get up on sidewalks easily.

I was stunned.

This was something I would never have thought of. But in that moment, it encapsulated everything America stands for to me: Access.

That a nation would care enough to build a way for some of its most vulnerable citizens to have access to basic mobility reflected something far greater than just being the proverbial “land of opportunity” and educational and employment opportunities.

It meant that its promise to citizens of “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness”, the three unalienable rights outlined in its Declaration of Independence, truly extended to all Americans.

I was well aware that historically, this right was not always a given. Slavery, sexism, and supremacist beliefs about other races and ethnic groups blocked the promise. Yet, Americans who believed in this idea of access and equality fought for it. And they won.

This is what the One America Registry is all about.

It is a response to President Donald Trump’s threat to establish a registry of all American Muslims.

Sound Vision, along with our coalition of 50 other organizations, invites all Americans to register. The aim is to oppose policies and programs which seek to divide us.

President Trump’s proposed Muslim registry targets all American Muslims. It is similar to one that was created for Japanese-Americans during WWII.

Seventy-four years ago today, an Executive Order was passed which made Japanese-Americans enemies of the state. Already registered, they were shipped off to internment camps. They lost their livelihoods, their properties and in a number of cases, their lives. The registry stripped these Americans of their rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It was unconstitutional and unjust."

Processed meats have enjoyed a terrible reputation among cardiologists pretty much since we figured out what that thumping thing in the middle of our chests was. And that’s not for nothing — that category of foods (which includes bacon, ham, and hot dogs) has been proven to increase your risk of heart failure. But contrary to popular belief, Etherton says bacon isn’t the worst of the bunch. Sausage has a slight edge due to its higher saturated fat content, so you can feel marginally better about ordering a side of bacon strips over a side of sausage links for breakfast.

Red meats (plus pork!)

This is another case where people rag on it for a reason. Red meats have a considerable amount of cholesterol and saturated fat, as well as another terror called L-carnitine, which is why they make your doctor so nervous. Pros like Etherton advise patients to limit lean red meats to less than 10% of their average diet to play it safe, and don’t think you can get away with replacing your porterhouse with a pork chop. “A lot of people say pork isn’t red, so you’re okay,” Etherton says. “But it still has a lot of saturated fat, so you need to limit it as you would any red meat.”"

Only two days after baseball analyst Curt Schilling ripped Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton, NFL analyst Mike Ditka blasted President Barack Obama as the “worst” president ever. He also said he’d probably vote for Donald Trump for president.

The longtime analyst on ESPN’s “Sunday NFL Countdown” made the comments Thursday during an appearance on the Bernie and Sid morning radio show on WABC-AM in New York. When asked about Obama by hosts Sid Rosenberg and Bernard McGuirk, Iron Mike unloaded on the commander in chief.

“Obama is the worst president we’ve ever had,” said the Pro Football Hall of Famer, who coached the 1985 Bears to a victory in Super Bowl XX.

Ditka believes Obama is a nice enough guy but that his leadership skills are “disgusting.” If Election Day were tomorrow, he said, he’d vote for the tough-talking Trump over Clinton or Republican rivals such as Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich.

“Barack Obama’s a fine man. I mean, he’s pleasant. He would be great to play golf with. He’s not a leader. This country needs leadership. It needs direction. It needs somebody that steps up front. We need somebody like Ronald Reagan,” Ditka said.

“Every once in a while you’re going to get punched in the chops. But you keep going forward. That’s all there is to it,” he added. “You know it’s not always going to be a perfect situation, but to do what he does, there’s no leadership there. I think that becomes very disgusting to me.”

(Ditka previously mused that his “biggest mistake” was not running against Obama for a U.S. Senate seat in 2004, which might have derailed Obama’s quest for the presidency.)

During Thursday’s interview, the old coach didn’t have many positive things to say about Clinton, either.

When the hosts played a clip of Clinton declaring Republicans want to take America back to the “Jim Crow past,” Ditka dismissed it as a “filthy statement” that could make you “throw up.”

Ditka came thisclose to endorsing Trump — a la NASCAR big boss Brian France.

The country is “devoid of leadership right now,” Ditka said. Love him or hate him, he added, the straight-talking Trump is better than Clinton or the other Republicans.

“If I were to vote tomorrow, I’d probably vote for Trump,” he said.

The rule was opposed by Republicans and a majority of the states, many of which filed a lawsuit to stop its implementation. President Donald Trump promised repeatedly on the campaign trail that he would do away with the blatant power-grab.

And now he has.

According to WTVJ, Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order requiring the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a thorough review and rewrite of the rule and for the Justice Department to suspend all legal action regarding the rule while the review is ongoing, according to the Washington Examiner.

Trump reportedly called the rule in its present state “a disaster” and one of the “worst examples of federal regulation” that “has truly run amok.”

Reaction to the order came swiftly, particularly from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has fought against the rule since its inception.

“The 2015 Waters of the United States rule was essentially a federal land grab. America’s businesses, farmers, and other land owners and managers will be happy to see it reconsidered and properly withdrawn under President Trump,” said a statement from William Kovacs, Senior Vice President of Environment, Technology, & Regulatory Affairs for the chamber.

“The rule would have given the EPA and the Corps unprecedented permitting and enforcement authority over land use decisions that Congress did not authorize,” Kovacs’ statement continued. “To add insult to injury, the two agencies refused to properly assess the economic harm the rule would cause, despite the objections of Congress, States, businesses — even other federal agencies.”

“We know that economic growth and environmental progress are not mutually exclusive goals. To achieve both, government must create a regulatory climate that is clear, certain and transparent so business is confident to invest, innovate and create jobs,” he added.

“If regulatory reform legislation like the Regulatory Accountability Act becomes law, poorly written rules like WOTUS would be subject to greater analysis and transparency,” Kovacs concluded. “We urge the U.S. Senate to take action to make regulatory reform a reality this year.”

We are thrilled that Trump took action to start the process of doing away with this horrible example of federal overreach. This is also a great step toward revitalizing the economy by releasing large and small businesses from the burdens placed on them by ideological control freaks in D.C. who have kept their boots on the necks of American producers for partisan reasons. Please share this on Facebook and Twitter to help spread the word that Trump has done away with Obama’s EPA rule on controlling all water, and the business community couldn’t be happier.

“Meet the terrorist behind the next women’s march,” by Kyle Smith, New York Post, February 25, 2017:

Here’s the left’s next great idea for bringing down President Trump: another women’s march. Which means another public instance of Trump haters shouting slogans to one another and mistaking it for constructive politics. What progressives need to defeat Trump is outreach, but all they have is outrage. On March 8, organizers seem to be aiming for a different vibe than the librarians-in-pussy-hats element that made the first women’s march after Trump’s inauguration so adorable. Instead of milling around Washington, organizers have in mind a “general strike” called the Day without a Woman.

However, she won the right to a new trial (set for this spring) by claiming she had been suffering from PTSD at the time she lied on her application. Oh, and in her time as a citizen, she worked for a while as an ObamaCare navigator. You can see why she’s a hero to the left. Another co-author, Angela Davis, is a Stalinist professor and longtime supporter of the Black Panthers. Davis is best known for being acquitted in a 1972 trial after three guns she bought were used in a courtroom shootout that resulted in the death of a judge. She celebrated by going to Cuba. A third co-author, Tithi Bhattacharya, praised Maoism in an essay for the International Socialist Review, noting that Maoists are “on the terrorist list of the US State Department, Canada, and the European Union,” which she called an indication that “Maoists are back in the news and by all accounts they are fighting against all the right people.” You know you’re dealing with extremism when someone admits to hating Canada. The International Women’s Strike is meant to be a grass-roots affair, with womensmarch.com promising more information about how to participate in local protests across the US. Women around the country are being urged to walk off their jobs and join a demonstration near them. According to The Guardian piece, women should spend their day “blocking roads, bridges, and squares, abstaining from domestic, care and sex work” and “boycotting” pro-Trump businesses. Also every woman is supposed to wear red in solidarity. The bristling tone of the manifesto and its call for a “militant” uprising are yet another indicator that liberals are increasingly willing to justify violence in the name of opposing Trump. After the Berkeley campus erupted in flames and violence to protest the planned appearance of Milo Yiannopoulos, many progressive activists took to Twitter to cheer them on. Hollywood stars Debra Messing and Sarah Silverman both tweeted their support, with Messing saying, “RESISTANCE WORKS” and Silverman ranting: “WAKE UP & JOIN THE RESISTANCE. ONCE THE MILITARY IS W US FASCISTS GET OVERTHROWN. MAD KING & HIS HANDLERS GO BYE BYE.” Progs are equally enthusiastic about the idea that it’s OK to punch people as long as you hate them: “Stranger Things” star David Harbour said at the Screen Actors Guild awards, “We will, as per Chief Jim Hopper [the character he played on the show], punch some people in the face when they seek to destroy the weak and the disenfranchised and the marginalized.” Nice liberal Democrats should be aware that this newer, angrier cohort is just as hostile to their own party. “I have problems with the Democratic Party that is just as linked to the corporate capitalist structure as the Republican party,” Davis said at a rally last year….

What it should prove is that Trump is neither willing nor able to change his stripes. He is a 70-year-old man (he will be 71 on June 14) who has had much success in his life. And he believes that the way in which he was elected president — against all odds and doing everything traditional politics says not to — is an affirmation that he is the only person who really understands his supporters and the mood of the country.

That assumption is what leads him to ignore advice from advisers about, maybe just maybe, putting down his phone at, say, 10 p.m. — or never picking it up at all. Trump believes in Trump — first, last and always.

Staff will come and go. But to expect anyone to change Trump in any way is to ignore, literally, his entire adult life.

Which means more “covfefes.” Maybe many more.

Time and time again, Republican elected officials have politely suggested that Trump use Twitter less and differently. Use it to rally his massive online support base behind policy initiatives rather than as a tool to exact revenge on people Trump thinks have wronged him. White House staffers have done the same, occasionally floating the idea that, at one point or another, Trump finally “got it” and was going to tweet differently from there on out.

428,http://www.nephef.com/trying-lose-weight-winter-5-tips-can-help/,nephef,Trying To Lose Weight This Winter? These 5 Tips Can Help,[],"Come New Years Day, most people kick into high gear, choose a new diet plan, pay for a gym membership, and do their best to transform their body. And most people, despite their best intentions, will struggle through the winter to lose the weight and keep it off.

What they don’t know is that winter weight loss requires a very different set of foods and behaviors than dieting in warmer months.

The best kept secret about proper winter weight loss?

You can cleanse your organs, boost your energy, and drop the weight in a holistic, natural way that reconnects you to your best guide: your body.

Most cleanses, diets, and detox plans focus on freshly pressed vegetable juices, fruits, salads, and raw foods that are actually too cooling for the body in cold winter months.

The human body has evolved with the seasons to eat heavily in the fall harvest season and keep weight on the winter to protect from the cold and lack of food. If you’ve tried a juice cleanse in the winter before, you’ll know what I mean.

We naturally crave warming soups, cooked foods, and the fats to protect our organs and skin from biting winds, freezing temperature, and less sunlight. A well-planned winter weight loss cleanse will help you feel strong and warm, and help you drop the extra pounds without leaving your frail and cold.

Here are my tops tips for cleansing in winter:

1. Eat for warmth.

When you’re physically cold, what sounds better: a chilled salad or a bowl of soup? See, you actually know your body better than you may think. Focus on the seasonal, local foods that grow near your home. For most of us, that means eating more naturally sweet, dense root vegetables, hearty winter greens, and quality animal products. Warming spices and herbs may also be used to ground and sustain your energy. Try my Warming Winter Cleanse Broth recipe below.

2. Focus on fats that trim.

Did you know your body needs the right kind of fats to help absorb important nutrients from food as well as lose weight? True story. Healthy fats help your body soak up vitamins A, D and E, and are necessary for a healthy nervous system. That also means when you eat the right fats, your mood is better.

Stock up on a variety of monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and the right saturated fats this winter, but avoid hydrogenated and trans fats that lurk in processed foods. Try olives, olive oil, almonds, avocados, salmon, walnuts, anchovies, flax seeds, hemp seeds, grass-fed butter, organic clarified butter, and unrefined coconut oil.

In fact, studies show that eating two tablespoons of unrefined coconut oil, rich in medium-chain-fatty-acids, with meals can boost body temperature and metabolism, helping to avoid the metabolic slow-down associated with winter dieting.

3. Savor sweets that slim.

Refined sugars and carbohydrates cause most obesity and heart disease, not fat. But we still crave sweet! This winter, eat a variety of naturally sweet, high-nutrient, seasonal vegetables to give you the sweet taste, satisfaction, and grounded, cozy energy you desire. Roast beets, bake sweet potatoes, and steam winter pumpkins and squash for their vitamins and mild natural sweetness, and it will be much easier to mute sugar’s siren call.

4. Sleep.

When the weather is cold, and the day is short, human bodies return to the natural, evolved state of slow metabolism and more sleep. Get more sleep during the early, dark evening hours, and wake up earlier to catch every ray of sunlight possible. When you wake up early and get more morning sunlight, it has a positive effect on your sleep cycle. More sleep before midnight, especially in winter, helps your mood stay stable, stops you from midnight snacking, and improves the quality of your sleep.

5. Enjoy a Warming Winter Cleansing Broth (Recipe)

Here is one of my best, mineral- and nutrient-rich, warming broths that you’ll love this winter.

Ingredients:

2 small or medium yellow onions, halved

5 stalks of celery, with leaves, roughly chopped

2 large carrots, roughly chopped

One large leek, roughly chopped

One large bunch of kale or bok choy, roughly chopped

2 parsnips, roughly chopped

2 large pieces of kombu or kelp sea vegetables

1 cup shiitake mushrooms, cleaned

2 inches fresh ginger, roughly chopped

3 cloves garlic, peeled and roughly chopped

Preparation

1. Combine all in a large pot and cover with enough cold, filtered water to cover.

2. Bring to a boil. Lower heat to a simmer with the lid on for one hour.

3. Turn off the heat, give your broth time to cool to a point where you can comfortably handle it, then strain through a fine meshed strainer. You can use a large spoon or spatula to squeeze liquid and nutrients out of soft veggies.

4. Be sure not to transfer hot broth to a glass container, but this broth can be refrigerated for a week in sealed glass jars.

429,http://now8news.com/dead-body-homeless-man-turns-legendary-elvis-presley/,now8news,Dead Body Of Homeless Man Turns Out To Be The Legendary Elvis Presley,[],"SAN DIEGO, California – A homeless man said to be around 80 years old was found deceased under a tree in San Diego, California. Nobody exactly knew the man’s identity, but friends and people that frequent the area referred to him as Jessie. Investigators preformed a DNA test in the nationwide DNA database, and the results have shocked the nation. ‘Jessie Doe’s’ DNA results matched that of Elvis Aaron Presley, who was thought to have died in 1977.

Lab technician Robert Brensdale said he and his lab assistant, Madeline Hedgespeth, laughed when the name popped up. “We thought somebody, somewhere, somehow in the system pulled the greatest and most elaborate prank on us ever, we both laughed with hysteria for about an hour,” Bresndale told Jerry Hardin of the Hollywood Word, a new entertainment publication based out of Los Angeles.

Brensdale and Hedgespeth then went to their superior with laughter, as if he were the one behind this “prank”. They were told to simmer down and stay quiet, that this was no laughing matter. From there, the results went up the ladder to the FBI and CIA.

Now, weeks later, FBI spokesperson Philip Hunter has revealed that the deceased man’s body was actually the body of Elvis Presley, who had been in the witness protection program since 1977.

The FBI has released this statement:

“Mr. Presley was placed in the program under a voluntary basis, but he was not a witness to any crime. Upon meeting President Nixon, the two became great friends, and Mr. Presley wanted out of his life, he wanted to be an unknown, so President Nixon made this possible. Yes, it is official – Elvis Presley was really alive all that time, and only a handful of people knew it, most of which are no longer with us.”

His body will officially be laid to rest at his original burial site in the Meditation Garden at Graceland mansion at 3764 Elvis Presley Boulevard in Memphis, Tennessee. The date has not yet been announced."

Eyewitnesses say the man, who look like he had been living off the streets, entered the store looking as if he was in a “daze.”

When confronted by a Walmart employee, the homeless man lunged at the victim sinking his teeth into the employees arm. As one of the customers attempted to save the employee, the crazed man bit the shopper in the neck.

“There were three other men that i saw who ran in to try to save the victims, but then they became victims,” said Rachel Stephenson who is shopping in the store at the time of the incident. “Every time someone stepped in to help, he bit into them with his teeth. I only got a quick glance, but I swear it look like he had fangs. It was absolutely terrifying.”

Walmart shoppers were eventually able to subdue the violent man and restrain him until police arrived. In total, six people were bitten and one was taken to the hospital in critical condition due to a severed artery in the neck. The attacker, who still has yet to be identified, is assumed to be homeless and is currently being held at a Tennessee psychiatric hospital. There is no word yet on whether or not drugs played a factor in this incident.

This incident comes just two days after a 24-year-old Brazilian man collapsed and died aboard an Irish aircraft after biting another passenger. The man was said to possibly be on methamphetamines when he became frantic and began biting into the flesh of another passenger on board. Unfortunately, authorities say they have seen an increase in these types of attacks, calling them Zombie-Like assaults."

The whereabouts of the missing infant has left authorities in shock.

According to the incident report, Gaskins had notified police that her 4-month-old daughter went missing three days ago. Gaskins was unable to find her daughter after breast-feeding the infant. She told police that her newborn daughter was in the bed with her and they both had taken a nap. After she had awakened, her daughter was missing.

“I took a nap around 4 PM after I ate some leftover KFC my neighbor had brought me and some chocolate cake,” Gaskins told police. “At the same time I was eating, I breast-fed my daughter for about 20 minutes then we both fell asleep. When I woke up around 6:30 PM and my little angel was gone. No one was at my house during that time that I know of.”

Authorities immediately searched the home of Gaskins but found no trace of the newborn baby girl. Police thoroughly questioned the mom and determined that she had no relation to the sudden disappearance of her daughter.

Three days following the incident, police arrived at the residence of Tanya Gaskins to be met by paramedics who were in the process of transporting the 700 pound women to the hospital. According to the paramedics, Tanya Gaskin had called 911 because of severe pains in her abdomen. Paramedics told the police that the house smelled of “something dead” with the odor lingering on Gaskins.

Police followed the paramedics to the hospital where doctors examined the morbidly obese woman – presenting the most gruesome discovery both doctors and the police had ever witnessed in the city of Greenville. The pain that Gaskins complained about in her abdomen, which doctors thought was appendicitis, was from the rotting corpse of her 4-month-old daughter. The girls tiny body was trapped under the fat of her mother.

Medical examiners determine the Gaskins rolled over the little girl while they both were sleeping, which led to the baby’s body getting stuck in the crevices of her mom. “The weight instantly killed the little girl, crushing her ribs and suffocating the child,” said Dr. Kingston, emergency room physician. “Because of the amount of fat on Tanya Gaskins body, she was unable to feel the little body being crushed underneath her. There was no way the little girl would have survived long in that situation.”

Tonya Gaskins was charged with child endangerment and involuntary manslaughter and is under house arrest awaiting trial."

Esmeralda Gonzalez, 64, says she encountered Trump during a secret Cancun vacation in January 1977. She claims that Trump approached her with a request and $5000 if she would “have sex with him.”

“Don’t believe everything you hear about this man,” said Gonzalez. “He told me he wanted to see if having sex with a woman in Mexico was any different than the women he was used to. Now, he has known he has had a son here in another country, but never accepted him. Now I want to come to the United States with my son.”

Donald Trump has not responded to the allegations that Gonzalez had birthed their ‘love child’ during a drunken encounter. However, Gonzalez said her son is willing to submit to a DNA test anytime. Gonzalez also says when the DNA test comes back proving Trump is the father, they want citizen rights in the United States.

With Donald Trump’s view on illegal immigration, it will be interesting to see the decision he makes concerning his own son. See the video below of an interview with his alleged son. Do you see a resemblance?"

She also pointed out that pregnancy is out of the question and will continue to perform unsafe sex since people in her area “love that kind of practice.” Among the 586 men she infected, 318 are students in the same college where she goes to school and the others are men from outside the area such as lecturers, married men, lawyers, some celebrities and three politicians."

437,http://now8news.com/trump-raising-age-limit-tobacco-consumption-25-years-age/,now8news,Trump Raising Age Limit For Tobacco Consumption to 25 Years Of Age,[],"There is more bad news for cigarette smokers – the US government is raising the age of consumption to 25 years old, due to the increasing health dangers of tobacco.

The cost of healthcare to treat the illnesses caused by tobacco was $96 billion in 2014.

By raising the legal age of consumption to 25 years old, it is estimated to reduce these costs by nearly 60% by the year 2021.

According to the Cancer.org website, tobacco use remains the single largest preventable cause of disease and premature death in the US.

Yet more than 45 million Americans still smoke cigarettes.

Tobacco smoke contains 7000 chemicals and compounds. Hundreds of these are toxic, and at least 69 are cancer-causing.

Currently there is a proposal to add an additional $2.50 tax to the price of a pack of cigarettes. They say a vote for raising the cigarette tax, as well as raising the age of consumption, is a vote against cancer.

States must increase their tobacco tax, because they expect the sales of cigarettes to dramatically decrease when raising the legal age of consumption to 25.

But Roy Jensen, director of the University of Kansas Cancer Center insists, “The most important components are the health benefits that will derive from it.”

However, The Citizens for Tobacco Rights are not happy about this new law which is set to take effect September 2016.

“If Congress gives the president what he wants, federal excise taxes will have increased almost ten-fold in just over a decade,” says the tobacco rights website. “The president’s tax increase will take the average price per pack up to $7.85, and put more than 70% of the price you pay for cigarettes into government pockets.”

When raising the legal age of tobacco consumption to 25, you can expect more black-market sales of cigarettes as well as arrests for underage purchases.

Activists say this law will only add to the problem."

Intense tickling of children under the age of 7 may cause asphyxiation which commonly leads to death. Trina Williams, 28, allegedly learned this the hard way and is now facing involuntary manslaughter charges for the death of her toddler. Even though this has been reported to have happened to small children in past incidents, police are not buying her story.

Williams said it was an innocent case of “the tickle game” that she played with her daughter ever since she was two months old. “Me and Tati love to play this game, we do it every night…. well, we did,” Williams told police, very straight faced, calm and collective. “I don’t know, then she just stopped moving, she was laughing hard and then went silent. I don’t know what went wrong. But I still have 6 other kids so we cool. I’ll miss her, but I guess it was just her fate.”

However, police are quite buying Williams story about what happened during her “innocent” tickle game. “Just by her statement she gave about what happened, I don’t believe her,” said chief of police Gerald Watson. “The toddler had bruises all over her body, and were still waiting for the autopsy report. This mom claims they were tickling bruises…yeah right. Either way, she killed her daughter and she has this ‘I don’t care because I have more kids’ attitude and it’s really disgusting.

Watson says the prosecution is hoping for a first-degree murder charge if the autopsy results come back as they believe they will. As for now, Williams is being held in the county jail with no bond. Her 6 other children have been placed in the care of Child Protective Services. (Photo Courtesy Of Charlotte Police Dept.)"
