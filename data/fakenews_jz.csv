Seems like a forced apology won’t be enough for Kathy Griffin after shocking the world with a graphic photo shoot holding a bloody, decapitated Trump head.

After a day of deliberation, CNN has announced that Griffin will not be rejoining the network for her marquis hosting gig: Co-Host of CNN’s New Year’s Eve broadcast from Time Square.

CNN’s public relations Twitter account broke the news Wednesday afternoon:

CNN has terminated our agreement with Kathy Griffin to appear on our New Year's Eve program. — CNN Communications (@CNNPR) May 31, 2017

The decision came as many were hammering the network for employing Griffin. One of those calling for her immediate removal was The President’s own son, Donald Jr who laid into the network, asking if they had the “moral/ethical standards” to discontinue their relationship with Griffin.

As of early Wednesday, according to CNN, the network was “evaluating” her future at the network:

CNN said it was evaluating the matter and had made “no decisions at this point.” “We found what she did disgusting and offensive,” a CNN spokesperson said. “We are pleased to see she has apologized and asked that the photos be taken down.”

The comedian has seen other financial and career repercussions for her photo shoot with a bloody, decapitated Trump head.

Griffin has been dropped as the official spokeswoman for Squatty Potty, a position she gained just weeks ago, and the ad campaign that featured her prominently has been removed from the company’s site.

The leadership inside the Squatty Potty company was horrified by Griffin’s decision to pose with the decapitated Trump head.

According to a statement given to Ad Week:

We were shocked and disappointed to learn about the image Ms. Griffin shared today. It was deeply inappropriate and runs contrary to the core values our company stands for,” Squatty Potty CEO Bobby Edwards said in a statement shared with Adweek. “In response, Squatty Potty has suspended its ad campaign featuring Ms. Griffin. We have acted swiftly and decisively to demonstrate our commitment to a culture of decency, civility and tolerance.

The full statement, according to BuzzFeed’s Jon Passantino:

The Trump family has also lashed out at the comedian.

President Trump called the act “sick,” followed by gut-wrenching tales of the President’s 11-year-old son seeing the images for the first time.

Time will tell if Squatty Potty and CNN won’t be the last to drop Griffin.

A Texas judge sentenced a man who sexually assaulted and infected two young girls to life in prison.

David R. Wilson, 33, was already a convicted pedophile when he molested his 23-month-old niece and another 14-year-old girl,

He had previously spent four years in jail for sexual assault when he took in his young niece because her parents were habitual drug users.

In November 2014, medical officials discovered the child had genital injuries that required reconstructive surgery.

After she tested positive for a variety of STDs, including HIV, chlamydia and genital herpes, authorities were notified.

Upon conducting tests on all four people who lived in the child’s household, it was clear who was the suspect: her uncle, who also had STDs.

Although he had chlamydia and a relevant criminal history, authorities did not arrest him.

Around the same time, a 14-year-old girl informed authorities Wilson had sexually assaulted her. She tested positive for several STDs and was also pregnant.

The victim was sexually assaulted inside Wilson’s pickup truck, the statement by the Houston Police Department says. The victim also told police she was sexually assaulted by Wilson on several other occasions.

“Wilson admitted to investigators he sexually assaulted the victim numerous times over the past couple of years and also had intimate relations with several unidentified females,” the report added.

Wilson was charged with “super aggravated sexual assault” — an enhanced charge because of the age of the younger victim, his niece.

The jury took an hour to find Wilson guilty. He was sentenced to life in prison.

“It’s a monster that does this kind of crime, this guy doesn’t deserve one minute less than the maximum punishment,” said legal analyst Joel Androphy."

Why support President Trump’s Immigration Ban? 19 MUSLIM IMMIGRANTS KILLED 2,977 AMERICANS September 11, 2001

The county, which has voted Republican since it went for a fourth term for Franklin Roosevelt in 1944, is deep in western North Carolina in NASCAR and bluegrass territory, and many of its residents find the message to be contrary to the Christian values that are the bedrock of the small town communities within the county.

President Trump won Catawba County 66.8 percent to Hillary Clinton’s 29.3 percent, so it might have been expected that the residents would support his travel ban, but their staunch religious beliefs appear to override any concern about the dangers posed by unvetted immigration.

The North Carolina Pastors Network is noted on the billboard as the sponsor and stands by the message despite some residents finding it offensive and even “unchristian.”

Residents of nearby Claremont and Catawba are talking about the sign on Interstate 40 that traverses the state from the Raleigh-Durham area through Winston-Salem and west to Knoxville, Tennessee.

Oliver Reitzell opposes the billboard on religious grounds.

“I believe in the Christian way, and that’s to embrace everybody. Kind of the hate message behind it, I’m not for that.”

An associate pastor at the Corinth Reformed Church in the town of Hickory goes a step further and says the billboard actually contradicts Biblical teaching and sees the presence of non-Christians as an opportunity to preach the gospel to them.

“My opinion is that I think these people need the saving gospel of Jesus more than I need to be protected,” Cummings said But Paul Cummings

“I’m perfectly willing for people who are hostile to us to be in our country, because that’s what loving your enemy is all about.”

Evangelist Dave Kistler, who heads up the North Carolina Pastors Network disagrees and says there is “nothing hateful” in the message on the billboard.

“Some have interpreted it to be that and say that. It was not. It is the truth.”

Huntington Beach California was the scene of one of President Trump’s iconic Make America Great Again rallies today. The crowd blanketed the area with American flags, Blue Lives Matter flags and red MEGA hats.

Unfortunately, their joyful rally attracted an undesirable element as well.

The so-called “anti-fascist” appeared wearing masks and hoods with signs and banners of their own. Little did they know that the Trump supporters had shown up loaded for bear.

This was the scene before the trouble makers made their appearance.

When the thugs showed up, though, the pro-America crowd didn’t back down. The two lines clashed with mostly verbal attacks at first."

The 2017 Chevrolet Cruze Diesel sedan has been EPA-rated 30/52/37 mpg (city/highway/combined) when equipped with the six-speed manual transmission. Based on those numbers, GM estimates the Cruze Diesel has a range of up to 702 miles on one tank.

The Cruze Diesel is powered by a 1.6-liter turbodiesel I-4 that makes 137 hp and 240 lb-ft of torque. In addition to the six-speed manual, the diesel is also offered with a nine-speed automatic, which is rated at 31/47/37 mpg. Chevy calls the 52-mpg highway number “segment-best,” but with Volkswagen’s Jetta TDI sidelined by the company’s diesel emissions scandal, it’s difficult to make any apples-to-apples comparisons. Both manual and automatic EPA estimates best the previous Cruze Diesel’s 27/44/32 mpg result, however. That car was powered by a 151-hp, 256-lb-ft 2.0-liter turbodiesel I-4 mated to a six-speed automatic.

Not surprisingly, the diesels’ fuel economy ratings also come in higher than their gas counterparts. The standard 2017 Chevrolet Cruze is powered by a turbocharged 1.4-liter I-4 that’s rated 30/40/34 mpg with the six-speed automatic and 28/39/32 mpg with the six-speed manual.

The 2017 Chevrolet Cruze Diesel sedan starts at $24,670, including $875 destination. The Cruze Diesel hatchback will arrive for the 2018 model year. Pricing and EPA estimates have not yet been announced for that model.

Remember the patent images of Benelli’s twin-cylinder powered motorcycle which were leaked around a year ago? Now the bike has taken the shape of reality and it has been spotted on showcase somewhere in China in showroom-like surroundings. The model in the images looks ready to roll out in the market and it has been speculated to be called “Benelli 750GS” as it carries the same moniker on its rear cowls.

The Benelli GS750 seems based on a completely new platform that uses a trellis frame, providing it with an appearance that looks much inspired by the popular Ducati Monster series. Moreover, the shape of the headlamp and the tail section also seem to share design cues with the Ducati Monster 696.

Powering the upcoming Italian machine will be the liquid-cooled, parallel-twin engine that was showcased by Benelli at last year’s EICMA show in Milan, Italy. Though it shares the basic design with the existing three-cylinder motor of the company, the entire internal geometry has been redesigned. As per the manufacturer, the motor has been claimed to deliver 98.3PS at 10,000rpm and a peak torque of 63.7Nm at 8000rpm. The figures look quite impressive, however, we can’t say anything with surety about the performance of the upcoming motorcycle.

Looking at the pictures of the Benelli 750GS, we can see features like beefy USD forks at the front, rear monoshock, projector headlamps, meaty tyres, dual front disc brakes, digital instrument cluster and much more. However, the in-depth feature details will come out only with the unveiling of the model. All we can say right now is the Italian manufacturer will definitely try to bring this new model in a very competitive price bracket that will position it as a very strong player in most of the markets. The product will challenge offerings such as the new Kawasaki Z650, Ducati Monster 797 and the Triumph Street Triple.

Maddow said, “Vice President Mike Pence has made a number of blunt direct false statements related to the Trump Russia investigation both during the transition and since he was vice president.

When controversy started to swirl around Mike Flynn because of his foreign contacts, Mike Pence bluntly asserted that the Trump transition did not apply for a security clearance for Mike Flynn’s son. They had actually applied for a security clearance for Mike Flynn’s son.

After the president fired the FBI Director, Mike Pence bluntly asserted that the decision to fire James Comey.

Was based on a recommendation from the Deputy Attorney General. The President himself and reportedly the Deputy Attorney General himself now today have both made clear that that was not the reason James Comey was fired.”

Breaking: Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump Busted for Criminal Activity Rachel Maddow listed other Pence lies like saying there were no Trump campaign contacts with the Russian government, and how it can’t be true that Pence didn’t know that Flynn was under investigation. The central question around Pence is how Flynn stayed around as national security adviser after he lied to Pence. Comey Agrees to Testify on One Condition – Read Now Maddow concluded, “Mike Pence apparently formed a political action committee this week. Maybe he’s looking at his bosses troubles in the Russia scandal, and starting to imagine himself becoming president? Mike Pence has his own troubles when it comes to this scandal. And as long as reporters like the ones who work at Reuters. Keep turning up 18 new previously undisclosed Russian contacts during the campaign that the White House hadn’t come clean about before even now. It seems like those troubles are going to get bigger, not smaller over time.”



As I have been writing for months, Mike Pence is going to go down for the Russia scandal. As early as January 2017, it became clear that if the Russia scandal blew up, Pence wouldn’t survive it.

Anyone who has been paying attention for the last four months knows that Pence is up to his eyeballs in the Russia scandal. Republicans are fantasizing about Pence becoming president. But the reality is that if Trump is impeached, Mike Pence’s political career is dead as a doornail.

This was evidenced recently as he went along with the left’s narrative of a “collusion” between Trump and the Russians while under oath, even though there still remains zero evidence to back up this ridiculous nonsense. Well now in a sick story just making headlines, a young teenage sexual abuse victim is going public with the highly disturbing that that happened to her last year when the ‘Weinergate’ scandal was rocking Hillary Clinton’s campaign that’s sure to put Comey’s name on America’s $h*t list even further.

For whatever reason, disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner just can’t stop snapping pics of his junk and sending it to underage girls. His latest victim was a 15-year-old girl that Weiner had preyed upon, knowing full-well that the girl was udnerage and still in high school. But not long after enduring being targeted by a nasty Weiner, she was abused yet again after what FBI Director James Comey did to her throughout the ‘Weinergate’ scandal. In a scathing letter, the teen said that Comey “victimized” her and through his reckless actions, “helped the abuse at the hands of Anthony Weiner to continue.”

After grilling the teenager for 7 several long hours over the horrifying ordeal, rather than protecting her identity, Comey they released her name to the press, where she then became the target of their incessant requests for information. She was then the target of vicious attacks, having to relive the embarrassing ordeal over and over. Check out her scathing letter, which is now starting to go viral:

Mr. James Comey

FBI Director

I am the 15-year-old (now 16) who was the victim of Anthony Weiner. I now add you to the list of people who have victimized me. I told my story originally to protect other young girls that might be a victim of online predators.

Your letter to Congress has now brought this whole matter back into the media spotlight. Not even 10 minutes after being forensically interviewed with the FBI for seven hours, I received a phone call from a REPORTER asking for a statement. Why didn’t you communicate with the local FBI agents that I had just spoken to? They could have scheduled our interview sooner or scheduled a time to interview me later, or change locations of the interview. My neighborhood has been canvassed by reporters asking for details about me.

In your letter, you chose to use a vague approach, meaning the media had to keep searching to try and find out what evidence you had uncovered and how. Every media outlet from local to national has contacted me and my family to get my “story.” Why couldn’t your letter have waited until after the election, so I would not have to be the center of attention the last week of the election cycle?

In his “cooperation” with you and with his love of the spotlight, Anthony Weiner has given information that led to the media finding me. You have assisted him in further victimizing me on every news outlet. I can only assume that you saw an opportunity for political propaganda.

I thought your job as FBI Director was to protect me. I thought if I cooperated with your investigation, my identity as a minor would be kept secret. That is no longer the case. My family and I are barraged by reporters’ phone calls and emails. I have been even been blamed in a newspaper for causing Donald Trump to now be leading in some polls and costing Hillary the election.

Anthony Weiner is the abuser. Your letter helped that abuse to continue. How can I rebuild my life when you have made finding out my “story” the goal of every reporter? When I meet with my therapist next time, she will already know what we are going to talk about before I get there by reading Friday, October 28th, 2016’s New York Times article.

I may have been Weiner’s victim, but the real story here is that I am a survivor. I am strong, intelligent, and certain that I will come out from under this nightmare, but it will not be as a result of your doing your job to protect me. I hope that by making my letter to you public, you will think about how your actions affect the victims of the crimes you are investigating. The election is important, yes, but what happened to me and how it makes me feel and how others see me, is much more important. It’s time that the FBI Director puts his victims’ rights above political views.

— Girl that lost her faith in America

P.S. To all reporters: AP, FOX, CBS, NBC, and all other media outlets, please respect my position and stop interrupting my life!

Just goes to show that these slime-balls in Washington have no interest in serving the American people, but protecting their own political endeavors. Share if you think FBI Director James Comey should be removed from his position! This is yet another shining example of why this idiot should not be at the helm leading the FBI!

According to Haynes, Durant can opt out after the first year.

USA Today‘s Sam Amick noted how much money Durant is leaving on the table:

Typo on option, obviously. Durant will sign a one-plus-one, with a player option for 2018-19. $25 million 1st yr (Max would've been 34.5) — Sam Amick (@sam_amick) July 3, 2017

Amick reported that if Andre Iguodala had left, Durant would have taken even less money to ensure the Warriors signed forward Rudy Gay.

Durant ended a high-profile trip into free agency last summer by confirming his intention to join the Warriors on July 4. He signed a two-year pact worth just over $54.2 million, which gave him the option to re-enter the open market after his first season with the Dubs.

The 28-year-old Washington, D.C., native stated the structure of the contract had nothing to do with looking for an early escape route, per Amick.

“I plan on being here,” Durant said. “I don’t want to go through that again.”

Amick noted the 2013-14 NBA Most Valuable Player reaffirmed that commitment to Golden State during a conversation in January about his old team, the Oklahoma City Thunder.

“I’m liking it here,” he said. “I’m liking everything that’s going on. I know what my contract says, but I didn’t plan on coming here for just a year. I’m in it right now, and I’m also just focusing on day by day.”

Durant averaged 25.1 points, 8.3 rebounds, 4.8 assists, 1.6 blocks and 1.1 steals in his first year playing alongside Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson. He was limited to 62 games due to a knee injury but returned for the team’s postseason run.

His strong play continued in the playoffs to help the Warriors capture their second championship in the past three years. He checked in at 28.5 points, 7.9 rebounds and 4.3 assists across 15 games and earned the NBA Finals MVP award after the team’s five-game triumph over the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Meanwhile, the issue of Durant’s contract slowly moved back into the spotlight, even though he remained firm in his desire to stick with the Dubs throughout the campaign.

The Warriors and the latest addition to their star-studded Big Four were able to work out an agreement on a new deal, taking the place of his old agreement and next season’s player option. While it’s not a surprise, it does ensure there won’t be any late change of heart by the forward.

Playing alongside such a talented supporting cast allowed Durant to play a career-low 33.4 minutes during the regular season. That number could dip even closer to 30 minutes during the course of the deal as the team looks to keep him fresh.

All told, with Durant now guaranteed to remain in the fold, the Warriors should once again head into next season as the clear favorite to capture the NBA title.

Dutch beer company Heineken is now shipping their beer with a sick message on the back. The multibillion-dollar brewer is calling for “a world without borders or barriers.”

Heineken is the latest multinational corporation to join in the push to erode national sovereignty and open all international borders.

Marketing executives at Heineken are hoping their brand is capable of shifting public opinion and convincing consumers around the globe to open their borders to share some beer.

While the marketing campaign appears on the surface to be a misguided attempt to pander to liberals around the world, it is actually in the best interests of the mega-corporation.

Many multinational firms are hoping to open borders in an attempt to drive down wages in developed countries. Heineken could save millions on labor as hordes of unskilled workers flock to steal European jobs.

However, the propaganda campaign will ultimately backfire, as many are planning to boycott the beer brand for promoting their globalist scheme.

Worse yet is the simplicity of the message on the back of the bottle. If you believe Heineken, opening the borders is simply the nice thing to do. According to Heineken, the world is not full of evil terrorists and dogmatic sadists, but potential friends blocked by those pesky borders.

In reality, the world is a very dangerous place. Heineken and the liberals who share their view are utterly ungrateful of the sacrifices of our ancestors. We have managed to achieve the safest and prosperous society in the history of man, and the globalists hope to erode our success to prevent hurting the feelings of murderous goat herders.

An open world may benefit Heineken’s bottom line, but it will expose us to the evils of the world. We cannot sacrifice our safety in the name of corporate profits.

We need to join with the others boycotting the domineering beer maker. We need to show corporations that they serve us, their customers, and cannot push their political propaganda without consequence."

The poll says, 56 percent of the registered voters deemed the order a ” terrorist hot spot restriction,” while 37 percent said it is more likely “Muslim Ban.”

Although more than half of the those polled do not believe the move was not an attempt to discriminate based on religion, a majority of the country disapproves of the executive order. Forty-six percent supported Trump’s Jan. 27 immigration order, according to Washington Examiner.

1,013 registered voters nationwide voted through landline and cellphone interviews. The poll was conducted by the Anderson Robbins Research and Shaw & Company Research. The survey’s margin of error was three percentage points for all registered voters.

Majority has always sided with Trump. All true patriotic Americans. And yes, we side with President Trump! Let him fix this and get on with the ban, he knows what he is doing!

But what happens when a group refuses to show respect to their neighbors? What if newcomers want to destroy the traditions and values of long-standing Americans?

That’s when you need to stand up and prove you won’t be intimidated by anyone. Just ask these farmers.

When an Islamic group moved in next door and told Craig Baker the pigs on his family’s 200-year-old Texas farm had to go, he and his swine decided to fight back.

In protest of being asked to move, Davis began staging elaborate pig races on Friday afternoons — one of the Islamic world’s most holy days.

Craig’s neighbors, the Katy Islamic Association, have plans to build a mosque and community compound on the 11 acres they purchased alongside his farm. Baker, 46, a stone-shop owner whose family has owned the farm for two centuries, says the association knew about the pigs when they bought the property, and it’s not fair for them to ask him to get rid of the animals… Neighbors have been showing support for Baker’s races, even coming in the pouring rain and giving donations ranging from $100 to $1000 to sponsor the events. Last Friday, more than 100 attended the pig races, and many say they don’t want the mosque either. Some fear it will appear out of place and hurt their property values. This story is from a few years ago. I wonder how radical leftists would react to such an event today? Most likely they’d freak out and protest this farm. They’d fight for the rights of the Muslim group, while ignoring the rights of the 200-year old, family-owned farm. Imagine the audacity of a group like this. They demanded that the farm be moved, simply because it offended them. So what? America is about freedom. A family has the right to raise their pigs on the same land they’ve had for over 200 years. Just because that offends a religious group doesn’t mean they must move. If Muslims are to get along with other Americans, they need to accept their ways of life. We don’t have to bend just to accommodate their strict rules. Yet time and again we find they demand from us what they are not willing to give."

For $400,000, you can buy a very nice Rolls-Royce Dawn. Or you can purchase something slightly less sleek but more versatile: a flying car.

Dutch company PAL-V is now taking orders for the world’s first commercial flying car, the Liberty. The company says that the Liberty models are fully compliant with safety regulations set by global governing bodies, and that deliveries will begin by the end of 2018.

The first 90 copies are designated as Pioneer Editions, boasting special exterior and interior details. For the personalized touch and additional standard features such as power heating, buyers will have to pay $599,000. After the Pioneer Edition sells out, PAL-V will start selling the standard model, known as the Liberty Sport, for $399,000.

“PAL-V deliberately chose to engineer, design and build a flying car with proven technologies and fully compliant with existing regulations,” the company said in a press release today. “This leads to a first product delivery date that is realistic and imminent.” PAL-V expects North America to be a major market for its flying car.

Buyers should have a license for both driving and flying. On the road, the Liberty can lower its suspension and make use of its tilting cockpit for better maneuverability. PAL-V lists top speed on the road as 100 mph, while 0-62 mph is estimated to take less than 9 seconds. In the air, it can travel at up to 112 mph.

PAL-V may be the first company to bring a flying car to market, but it isn’t the only one in the game. Airbus is another potential player and says it will have a prototype by the end of the year.

Boston Marathon Bomber Tsarnaev Severely Injured In Prison, May Never Walk Or Talk Again

Infamous Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 22, was the victim of an “unfortunate accident” yesterday at Ft. Devens Detention Center in Massachusetts, just a few short months after his high-profile trial and sentencing, according to warden Paul Jacobson.

Corrections officers reportedly found the terror suspect face down in a pool of his own blood in his cell; a banana peel was found on the floor nearby.

“It initially appeared as though Tsarnaev slipped on a discarded banana peel and hit the floor with such force that his head bounced off the hard tile surface, probably 16 or 17 times.

There was blood everywhere – all over the walls, the floor, even the toilet.

The injuries have caused massive brain trauma,” said prison investigator Joe Goldsmith.

“We determined though, through expert analysis, that it would be impossible for these injuries to have occurred through a fall.

Our investigation has shown that that it was the Aryan Brotherhood who initiated an attack on Tsarnaev.”

“Yes, it was the brotherhood who took care of that bomber,” said Miles Smith, head of the Aryan Nation inside Devens.

“The other gangs, they wanted him, too.

We paid the guards the most money to have a shot. They stood aside, and let us do what we do.

On the way out, they shook our hands, told us ‘Thank you.’ Well, You’re welcome. You’re welcome, Boston. You’re welcome, America!”

“Normally, an attack this violent, this cruel, on another inmate would get any offending party more time added to their sentence”

said warden Jacobson.

“Because of the nature of Tsarnaev’s crimes, though, we have decided to actually reduce the sentences of the Aryan members who were involved.

They have done our prison and our country a great service, and we appreciate it immensely.

They are heroes in the eyes of not only this institution, but also in the eyes of the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.”

Tsarnaev had pled not guilty to all thirty charges filed against him

but was found guilty on all counts in April. He was sentenced to the death penalty per the crimes committed.

According to Politico, Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin said Thursday that China’s Bank of Dandong had been blacklisted for being a “foreign financial institution of primary money laundering concern.”

“This bank has served as a gateway for North Korea to access the U.S. and international financial systems, facilitating millions of dollars of transactions for companies involved in North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs,” Mnuchin said.

“The United States will not stand for such action. This will require U.S. banks to ensure that the Bank of Dandong does not access the U.S. financial system directly or indirectly through other foreign banks.”

In addition to targeting the Bank of Dandong, the Treasury Department also sanctioned another company — Dalian Global Unity Shipping Co. Ltd — and two Chinese individuals for their dealings with the North Koreans.

According to Reuters, Wei Sun was sanctioned for his connections to the Foreign Trade Bank of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Hong Ri Li for links to Song Hyok Ri, a North Korean banking executive.

“While today’s actions are directed at Chinese individuals and entities, we look forward to working closely with the government of China to stop illicit financing involving North Korea. We are in no way targeting China with these actions,” Mnuchin said.

However, this past Wednesday, a White House official said that China was “falling far short of what it could bring to bear on North Korea in terms of pressure,” according to The New York Times.

Whether or not Mnuchin’s claim that the sanctions weren’t targeting China itself was just for public consumption, it’s clear that the Trump administration is looking to put pressure on North Korea in any way possible, and that includes putting pressure on their biggest partner.

Kristina Buhrman – an eighth-grade math teacher and substitute bus driver at Discovery Academy in Lake Alfred, Florida – told CNN she was just doing her job when she saved 38 middle school students from a burning bus.

While she was driving the bus towards school, she noticed smoke was coming from it, but at first didn’t think anything of it. That is, until one student in the back of the bus screamed:

“Ms. Buhrman, there’s smoke coming out of my seat.”

Not a second later, she sprung into action, pulling over the bus and evacuating all of the students.

“Once I got them off the bus, then I moved them down, and there was a ravine down there or like a drainage ditch, so I had to try to get them into a straight line to get them across the drainage ditch without falling into the drainage ditch,” she said.

CNN

The evacuation occurred just in time – the bus burst into flames as the last students were de-boarding bus.

CNN

Buhrman recalls that every kid that got off the bus said thank you to her.

As she drove home later that day, she passed by the singed bus as it was being loaded onto the tow truck.

“That’s when it hit me. Hard… That could have been really bad. It could have been horribly bad,” she said.

But she knows that she couldn’t have done what she did with a little help. She told CNN:

“After the bus fire, I had received a call saying that a photographer had taken a picture of the bus and they said when I was ready I could view it. So I opened it up, and there was a picture of a rainbow over the bus; however, it wasn’t raining… I immediately started crying because like I knew that we were being taken care of.”

Twitter

Buhrman talked about her motivation behind her actions — “We’re put in certain places, and if we’re not helping other people, what are we on earth for?”

It looks like the Bentley Bentayga won’t have the luxury SUV crown for much longer, at least not without a fight. The upcoming Rolls-Royce Cullinan SUV was once again spied during testing, this time in a frosty winter environment. Following a preview earlier last year, this is one of the best looks we’ve gotten at the all-terrain Rolls.

Not much is known about the Cullinan, but the SUV will debut a new aluminum-intensive platform that will underpin all future Rolls-Royce models, including the next Ghost and Phantom. The camouflaged prototype sports proportions similar to a full-size Range Rover. The trademark upright radiator grille makes it clear this is Rolls’ SUV, however.

Underneath the slab-sided styling likely beats one of Rolls’ twin-turbocharged V-12 engines, sending power to all four wheels through an automatic transmission. We imagine it’s unlikely owners will be rock crawling in their very, very expensive SUV, but the Cullinan could prove to be quite capable off-road.

Aside from the Bentayga, the Cullinan will be the only other SUV available in the segment until the Aston Martin DBX and the Mercedes-Maybach SUV arrive.

Take a look at the future of Rolls-Royce in the photo gallery below.

Maybe none,” he said. In verbal retaliation, Germany’s economy minister said the US needs to build better-quality cars if it wants to sell overseas.

The reality is that BMW already builds a lot of cars here — thousands more than it sells in the US. Another reality is that four US nameplate automakers actually have better long-term reliability than BMW, Audi, or Mercedes-Benz. Including Chevrolet.

Charge and counter-charge

Trump took time off from picking his cabinet and blasting Saturday Night Live to give an interview with The Times of London. “Germany is a great country, great manufacturing country — you go down Fifth Avenue everybody has a Mercedes-Benz in front of their building, right — the fact is that it’s been very unfair to the US, it’s not a two-way street,” he said, adding, “How many Chevrolets do you see in Germany? Maybe none — not too many — how many — you don’t see anything over there — it’s a one-way street — it’s gotta be a two-way street.”

When asked if German automakers should be building more cars in the US, Trump said, “I would tell BMW if they think they’re gonna build a plant in Mexico and sell cars into the US without a 35 percent tax, it’s not gonna happen, it’s not gonna happen — so if they want to build cars for the world I would say wish them luck — they can build cars for the US but they’ll be paying a 35 percent tax on every car that comes into the country.”

In an interview with the German newspaper Bild, Sigmar Gabriel, Germany’s economy minister and vice-chancellor said, “The American car industry is getting worse, weaker, and more expensive. … The US needs to build better cars” if Americans are choosing German cars over American.

The reality: BMW is America’s biggest car exporter

What Trump apparently didn’t know is that BMW Group (the umbrella for BMW, Mini, and Rolls-Royce) is a model for exporting cars from the US. The BMW factory in Spartanburg is BMW’s largest facility in the world, with the most volume: 411,171 BMWs built there last year, versus 365,204 BMWs and Minis sold in the US. Nobody exports more cars from the US — not Ford, not GM, not the Chrysler arm of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles: 287,700 BMW vehicles last year, or 70% of production, and 3.7 million vehicles since the plant opened in 1996.

Every BMW SUV (except the subcompact X1) is built in one factory – Spartanburg — then shipped to the 140 countries where BMWs are sold. Mercedes builds SUVs and compact C-Class cars at a factory in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and is building a factory for Sprinter vans in Charleston, SC.

Nobody is like the Germans when it comes to creating sport-luxury vehicles that handle well at insanely high speeds, which may play against more softly sprung Buicks selling well in Germany (in China, they sell briskly). But Americans do make some US-flagged cars that are more reliable. The J.D. Power 2016 Vehicle Dependability Study, which measures problems encountered per 100 vehicles after three years of ownership, has Lexus and Porsche running 1-2. Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW are clustered at 11-12-14, slightly better than average. But the vehicles of five US-flagged companies are better on VDS: No. 3 Buick, No 5 GMC, No. 6 Chevrolet, No. 9 Ram, and No. 10 Lincoln.

If there’s a reason why US-flagged cars aren’t selling well in Europe, it may be that Ford and GM have cars specifically designed for international markets. Many US-designed cars are also built to be softer-riding and bigger inside and out to take account of our expanding waistlines, when Europeans want cars that make it through narrow streets. Americans are about 25 pounds heavier than in the 1960s.

Among BMW, Michelin (US HQ and factory nearby), and hundreds of suppliers, BMW and Michelin account for more than 75,000 jobs out of a South Carolina civilian workforce of just over 2 million.

If the President-elect wants to pick a fight with BMW in a state than went 55-41 for Trump, he may get push-back from Palmetto State residents and voters hoping nobody upsets the status quo.

21,http://nbc.com.co/suicide-will-affect-aaron-hernandezs-estate-payout/,nbc,How Suicide Will Affect Aaron Hernandez’s Estate Payout,"['Almira Anke', 'Hanif Ibrahim', 'Jacob Morgan']","Aaron Hernandez’s legal troubles have captivated the American public for years, from the beginning of his stardom to his end in a prison cell. The recent discovery of his suicide left many of his victims without the closure they needed. What it also might have done was to exonerate him from the guilt of his actions. Due to his untimely death, he stands the chance of having his conviction for the murder of Odin Lloyd vacated. Under Massachusetts law, if someone dies before they are allowed to have a repeal case of their conviction, then the conviction can seek to be vacated.

Hernandez’s suicide not only has implications for his convictions, but it also has repercussions for his estate and who is entitled to it. Hernandez grew up in Bristol, Connecticut and began his career playing football for the University of Florida. He was considered one of the best tight end players on the field during the three years he played for the New England Patriots. He wasn’t cut from the playing field after his arrest for the death of Odin Lloyd. At the time of the murder Lloyd was dating Hernandez’s fiancee’s sister.

Hernandez was sentenced to life in prison in 2015 after being convicted of first-degree murder in Lloyd’s death. His legal troubles didn’t stop there. There was also mounting evidence that Hernandez was also involved in a drive-by shooting on April 14th, but he was acquitted of those charges. Just five days after being found not guilty, he was found hanging in his cell after apparently committing suicide.

Hernandez’s suicide could have potentially come at just the right time for his legal worries. In the state of Massachusetts, if a defendant doesn’t have their case heard before an appellate court before they die, then lawyers can attempt to have the convictions against them overturned, which is exactly what his attorneys have filed a motion to do. Since Hernandez’s case was not heard before the Supreme Judicial Court before his death, he might just get away with murder.

Prosecutors insist that they will fight the vacating of the convictions, but it is not likely they will win. Whether the conviction stands or not really means nothing to Hernandez himself. Already having fallen from grace, he left a legacy that paints the picture of a very brutal and violent human being. But the convictions being vacated could have a potential impact on many victims’ families’ civil cases.

Although acquitted of the drive-by shootings of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, the victims’ families had filed a wrongful death case against Hernandez. The Lloyd family has also initiated a case against Hernandez’s estate to collect for Lloyd’s death. It’s not just his house and Hummer that are up for grabs; in 2012, Hernandez had signed a contract for $40 million to be paid out over five years, of which he had received approximately $10 million. After he was arrested, the Patriots withheld the remaining money — close to $6 million — and they also took his base amount of over $2.4 million and a sign on bonus of about $3.2 million. Although there are no official reports about how much Hernandez’s legal defense cost, there is likely some money to recover for the victim’s families.

According to lawyers Queens NY, his house is also estimated to be worth somewhere around $1.3 million, and his other assets may also be up for grabs if the families can recover. But there is speculation about how his suicide may affect their ability to collect from his estate, and if his conviction is vacated, what does that mean for his victim’s family? Because Lloyd’s case has already been proven, there is little doubt that the family will not be able to recoup.

But when it comes to the Furtado and De Abreu families, much less proof is needed in a wrongful death suit, but without Hernandez around to defend himself, the whole situation could become very complex. From stardom to bottoming out, Hernandez’s fall from grace was of his own doing.It’s likely the people who will suffer most are those who lost loved family members. Even if they can win their wrongful death suits, they still won’t win back their loved ones."

There is nothing lighthearted about what lifeguards do, however — especially on beaches where there are turbulent waves or riptides and people who aren’t aware of the danger dive right in. Although lifeguards are typically trained by the Red Cross, there are many situations that can happen with disastrous endings.

There used to be laws in place that protected a lifeguard from prosecution if things didn’t go right, but Hawaiian legislators are considering removing those protections, opening lifeguards up to potentially be sued. The Maui County and Makena State Beach Park lifeguards are in real danger of being vulnerable to personal injury lawsuits if the state legislator doesn’t extend the laws that have been in place for over 15 years to protect lifeguards from legal action.

On June 30th of this year, if actions aren’t taken to prolong a bill and make it permanent, then area lifeguards will be open to liability when people get hurt. A bill set to extend the limited immunity liability has already made it through the Senate; the House has all but gutted it, though, and might just allow the current measures in place to expire. The House bill is going to return to the Senate, and then both chambers will need to reach an agreement about how to resolve the many differences that they are proposing.

The House bill varies from the Senate version because it requires that the personal injury attorney Tampa, is required to defend any civil case that is based on negligence, omission, or a wrongful act at the hands of a lifeguard at designated state beach parks. Both counties are looking for the same thing: protection for their workers. They know that being a lifeguard isn’t an easy job; it’s a very dangerous job, and without protection an individual can potentially face both harm to themselves, and now liability.

If the measure is not extended and the lifeguards aren’t provided the protection they need, then both communities insist that they won’t be able to provide lifeguard services at beach parks as a community resource. People will have to be left to their own devices to protect themselves in the ocean, which is a scarier proposition than just extending the liability clause.

The Senate Bill 562 was set to make the allowance against liability a permanent one, which has been in place since it was first drafted in 2002. A revised bill was to go through both the Senate and the House, and its aim was to make the law’s liability protection extend another four years. It shielded lifeguards from any personal injury liability unless there was found to be any act of omission or wanton or gross negligence in the lifeguard’s actions.

One of the chief lawyers lobbying against Bill 562 is Bob Toyofuku, who is part of the Hawaii Association for Justice, an organization that is a champion for Hawaii’s personal injury lawyers. They maintain that giving a lifeguard an additional pass that other workers aren’t afforded just isn’t reasonable. They should be held accountable as any other employee would be in the case where they perpetrated an act that ended in a personal injury to someone.

The Tort Claims Acts was initiated to treat lifeguards on any state beach as state employees, and guarantees the right to be defended against any lawsuits made against the county. Although Toyofuku insists that he would support amendments made to the current laws, he doesn’t believe that any lifeguard who acts negligently should be free and clear from prosecution. He believes that it sets the precedent for the public to be less safe when under the “watchful” eye of lifeguards.

The facts are that the measure already doesn’t protect lifeguards from personal liability if there is gross negligence on behalf of the employee. The additional protection that they are free from prosecution when they have done everything within their power is necessary. Without those allowances, it is unlikely that any employee would perform such a dangerous job and put themselves in a high-liability position, and this could leave the Hawaiian state beaches unprotected going forward."

This shocking and exciting news comes not from an internet message board or the rumor mill but from series creator Vince Gilligan. In an exclusive CNN interview late Thursday evening, Gilligan dropped the bombshell.

“Walter White is not dead, and neither is Breaking Bad,” said the 47-year-old writer, director, and executive producer of the groundbreaking show.

“We’ve kept it under wraps for months, now the cat’s out of the bag. Season 6 is coming, and it’s going to be epic and true to the fans that have followed the show so incessantly.”







Gilligan explained his decision to continue with the popular series.

“I just couldn’t walk away from it. This isn’t a cash-grab or a sophomoric attempt to bastardize what was such a beautiful ending to season 5. I’ve invested so much of myself in these characters that I’d always had an inkling I’d return to it, even outside [the] Better Call Saul [spinoff]. The kicker was I’d need a spark, something that made it make sense for these stories to continue.”

The series star Bryan Cranston seemed to drop a major hint in an interview with CNN’s Ashleigh Banfield back in May. Asked by Banfield if his character, Walter White, died or not, Cranston said, “Hey, you never saw bags zip up or anything. Or say … you know.”

In response to questions about whether the character could show up in a movie or anywhere else ever again, Cranston said: “Never say never.”

Gilligan explained how the decision came about to do a season six.

“Bryan [Cranston] called me up last year and said he had this incredibly lucid dream in which Walt wakes up in a hospital bed surrounded by the DEA, ends up breaking out of prison and finds out he’s got fans,” Gilligan said. “This isn’t a redemption story, it’s got a bleak, dark premise. I can’t give away any more of the details, but let’s just say Walt has quite a bit of unfinished business to attend to, and it sure as hell has nothing to do with teaching high school science.”

According to Gilligan, the entire cast has principally agreed to return for at least one more season. This includes Bob Odenkirk, star of ‘Better Call Saul’, the prequel comedy series which just finished season one over at AMC.

“I’m not surprised in the least that Vince is going back to Breaking Bad,” said Odenkirk. “I’ve been working with him on set for a long time, and the last few times I’ve seen him, he’s had sort of a glint in his eye, a bounce to his step. He’s laughing at a bunch of jokes I couldn’t pull off two years ago. I mean, comedy and drama can be radically different, and no one does drama like Vince. I’m completely on board.”







Paul Horner, a Breaking Bad writer since season one, upon hearing the announcement by Gilligan confirmed the news with MSNBC.

“Yes, it’s true. You don’t know how much of a relief this is to finally get this off my back. I’ve been keeping this a secret for two long months now, I was ready to explode,” he said. “Here’s a little spoiler for all you fans out there so stop reading right now if you don’t want any information, otherwise, lets go. Season six begins with Walt waking up in the hospital, handcuffed to his bed. Like Bryan [Cranston] said last May, nobody ever saw a body bag, so essentially, the last episode of Season 5 was left open-ended. Skyler, Walt Jr., Marie… none of them have any idea he’s survived, but the DEA is right on top of it. We’ll go through the motions of people finding out he’s alive – many people wanted Walt dead, so there’s a lot of disconcerted, angry people out there. We have Walt going to trial, his incarceration and how he’s keeping Heisenberg and the blue meth on the streets during his imprisonment. Season 6 will have Walt’s eventual breakout, despite the fact that he’s being held prisoner in a fashion not seen since Hannibal Lecter. The nationwide manhunt for Jesse Pinkman is both epic and gripping, and I can tell you for certain his relationship with Walt will continue, in a much more strained, arch-nemesis-type fashion. None of this is anything you won’t find out about in the trailer, but it’s high time to get truly, truly excited for the greatest show of all time! I believe in this, it’s a valid and worthwhile continuation of something that deserves discernment and care. Breaking Bad Season 6! It’s not over yet!”

The original series won multiple awards, including ten Primetime Emmys. Out of 267 nominations, Breaking Bad has garnered 101 trophies. Shooting for Breaking Bad: Season 6 is scheduled to begin August, 2015.

When Jimmies Are Not Being Rustled The Kind Dr. Enjoys Being An Amazing Husband To His Beautiful', 'Soulmate', 'Anastasia']","London, England — What is Bill Murray not capable of doing? According to Fox News, that is the question being asked by London residents and police today as Murray saved the life of a 9-year-old girl from certain death after he pushed her out of the way at the last second of a semi-truck that was barreling down on the young girl at full speed.

36-year-old Paul Horner, who is in London on business, witnessed the near fatal accident, and told the BBC News about what he saw.

“Yeah, it was horrifying. I saw this little girl standing in the middle of road on her phone and this truck was just going full speed, right towards this poor girl. Then out of nowhere this man pushed her out of the way at the last second saving her life,” Horner said. “So I ran over to them to see if they were alright and to my amazement I see that the girl was perfectly fine and the guy who saved her was none other than Bill Murray! It was Bill frickin’ Murray who saved this kids life!” Horner continued, “That guy is always doing something awesome whether it’s making any movie he wants to be in, playing golf with the pros, crashing random parties, bartending with RZA and GZA from the Wu Tang Clan, eating french fries off the tables of random people or saving lives! He’s everywhere!”

9-year-old Courtney Groves from Bristol, England told reporters about her near death experience.

“I was just playing Zombie Playground, it’s like my favorite game, and wasn’t paying attention to the cars around me. Thank you Mr. Murray for saving my life today,” Groves said. “He even sat down with me and helped me finish the level I was playing. We got a perfect score! He told me that he was in a movie years ago about a zombie, just like my game! I didn’t know what he was talking about but Bill Murray liked my game and he saved my life so I thought that was really neat!”







Murray spoke briefly to reporters about the incident.

“I’m no hero, I was just in the right place at the right time. I think anyone else in my position would have done the same,” Murray said. “Courtney is a great kid. We talked for a while. She even let me play her game on her phone. I told her the next time you wanna play video games, don’t do it in the middle of traffic.”

25-year-old Brian Barth who is a game developer on the Zombie Playground™ team told CNN that he is thrilled the child was not injured.

“It’s an amazing thing that Bill Murray was there to save her life.” Barth said. “It feels really good when someone plays a game you helped create, had a hand in developing; it’s just not a game meant to be played in the middle of traffic, that’s for sure, well unless Bill Murray is there,” Barth laughs.

Boris Johnson who is the Mayor of London told reporters how proud he is to have Murray currently in his city.

“This is a day for everyone in London to celebrate Bill Murray,” Johnson said. “Most blokes would have just stood there like an arse and let that poor girl get run over, but not Mr. Murray. So it is decided, for his bravery we are throwing him a parade and awarding him a key to the city. Today is Bill Murray day in London!”

Murray was in London visiting friends and sightseeing when this near-tragic event took place. Murray says he plans to stay in London for another week and then is off to Japan to finish up work on a new project. Police believe alcohol was a factor in this near-fatal car accident."

When Jimmies Are Not Being Rustled The Kind Dr. Enjoys Being An Amazing Husband To His Beautiful', 'Soulmate', 'Anastasia']","WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — Today President Donald Trump said that he would be adding homes to the entire wall that will run along the U.S. border and Mexico exclusively made for American war veterans.

“We’re gonna build the wall, and we’re gonna make it so great, the best ever, a perfect place for our heroes to live, our amazing veterans, 4 story buildings all across that 2,000 miles of land, you’re gonna love it,” Trump told reporters. “We’ll be able to house up to 250 war veterans ever mile and because of how many miles my wall is gonna be, that’s up to 500,000 war veterans that we’ll be able to house right there on the American and U.S. border. I promise you, no veteran in America will ever have to worry about having a roof over their head ever again.”

The U.S. border with Mexico is roughly 2,000 miles long and underlines four states, from California to Texas, more than half of it along the Colorado River and Rio Grande.

Senate leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, said Congress will follow through on Trump’s border wall order, and McConnell estimated it will cost $15 billion at most — he cited a range of $12 billion to $15 billion. With the homes for war veterans, there will be an added cost of $5 billion dollars. But the Trump administration said that, “Mexico will pay for it, so there’s no need for American tax payers to worry.”

On the campaign trail Trump’s immigration reform plan called for impounding remittance payments derived from illegal wages, a controversial idea, and imposing increased visa and entry fees to the United States from Mexico unless the latter agrees to finance the wall. Trump is also pushing border taxes more broadly against trading partners, which could help finance the wall.

Marc Rosenblum, deputy director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute spoke to reporters about the current wall in place.

“The first miles of fencing were in the easiest places,” said Rosenblum. “There were fencing areas in or close to cities and accessible transportation, rather than deep in deserts or mountains. Additionally, the first miles were on public lands, while completing a border wall would require the government to acquire land from private holders and Indian Reservations. The GAO estimate for one difficult section of fencing near San Diego was $16 million.”

President Trump, speaking last year on the campaign trail spoke about the wall at almost every rally.

“I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I’ll build them very inexpensively — I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.”

Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward , a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to CNN about Trump’s decision.

“This is a story about Donald Trump making his wall out of homes for war veterans that will run along the U.S. and Mexico border.” Bradley said. “I just want to say a big thanks to everyone that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless, it means so much. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps .”

Trump tweeted today saying:

“Great news everyone! We’re gonna build the wall out of homes for our amazing war veterans! They’ll never have to worry about housing again!”

Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told CNN he believes what Trump is doing is the right thing.

“A wall made out of homes for our veterans is a great idea. When Mexico invades us, I know we’ll be ready, thanks to our American veterans that will be protecting us at the border. Also, I appreciate Donald Trump and his strong stance on masturbation, he’s doing the Lord’s work. Praise Donald Trump!”

The Trump Administration has set up a 24-hour hotline to address any questions and concerns the public may have regarding the wall being made out of homes for American war veterans. The number for that hotline is (785) 273-0325."
30,http://nbc.com.co/horror-movies-themes-online-games-popularity/,nbc,Horror movies themes online games and their popularity,"['Almira Anke', 'Hanif Ibrahim', 'Jacob Morgan']","People are somehow wired to love scary stuff. Not only are horror movies thrilling, but they are fun to watch. That’s the reason why this genre will continue reigning supreme in just the same way it has done over the last couple of decades. This clearly shows that horror movies have an audience, so why not convert some of those movies into slot or board games?

Well, that’s the idea. If you love thrills and chills, then there is something specific for that taste. There is no shortage of online games that are based on movies. And most importantly, we know that these games provide a way to have fun in a safe environment, especially during the Halloween season. But due to the scary nature of certain online games, a certain segment of the population can’t play them. This includes children or people who are below 12 years of age.

Reasons why Royal Vegas online casino will have something in the horror category

Remember when we first got introduced to the Walking Dead season premier. We couldn’t get enough of traveling in a terror-field country of zombies. The most interesting part came as a result of characters fighting for their survival.

The most thrilling part of it is when characters try reaching various objectives only to risk being swallowed alive by the zombies. And even though this is the case, they have to fetch for food, or take care of the sick, make new friends, and keep going until they make it. Of course such an environment is also filled with fast-paced action followed by chills. This is very entertaining especially when put in a game format.

Again, there’s the element of creepiness which makes horror-themed online games a favorite among many gaming enthusiasts. If you look at the 5 top horror movies of the last 10 years, you will most likely come across movies that are based on paranormal activities. This often involves a haunted house and some investigators who are trying to establish the cause of weird activities in that particular house. Not only is this creepy in a game, but it can also kick your adrenaline as some games come with amazing miniatures to thrill you. Even the thought of keeping the lights on during nightfall is enough to send chills down your spine.

Finally, the last category of horror movies are based on blood-sucking creatures named vampires. These movies have since been converted into online games such as Fury of Dracula and so on.

So if you’re playing any of these games at Royal Vegas online casino, be sure to have fun with the challenging goals which must be met. You have to contain your excitement and really focus in order to beat the odds. Above all, Royal Vegas online casino provides value for their offering by rewarding you with bonuses.

Some games will trigger bonuses when certain action is taken by the player. It’s always an element of fun and surprises when playing these games at Royal Vegas online casino. So you should definitely give it a shot if you love this genre."

This guy knows how to work a room; picking out the weakest link and then devouring them with his hard-hitting, extremely uncomfortable, serial-killer-ish, style of humor. Nothing is off limits to Gregory.

I remember being at a party about a year ago with Jonathan. He walked up to me without saying a word. He then proceeded to look me directly in the eyes for what seemed like an eternity, then took his attention off me and gradually looked around the room, eying each person there. Then Gregory turns back to me and in a deep voice slowly says, “Which one would you kill first?”

With his signature black shirt, long hair and menacing facial expressions, this dude is creepy and it all adds to the fun of his act.



Gregory’s comedy, although unique and different, has been well received by a wide variety of audiences. This includes bars, theaters, world-class comedy clubs and even retirement homes. Gregory has over 10 million views on his YouTube page and his television credits include Showtime Boxing, NBC’s Last Comic Standing season 6, and E! Network’s True Hollywood Stories Investigates Hazing.

According to Gregory’s website, he spent over a year on a weekly morning radio program called “Think Tank Tuesday” which was part of the Morning Infidelity on KWSS 106.7FM. There his awkward take on the daily news brought laughter to listeners as they went about their morning commute. Gregory’s stand-up has been featured at the SLO Comedy Festival, Ventura Comedy Festival, the iO West Comedy Festival in Hollywood, Comedy Central’s “Up Next” Contest, Rooftop Comedy, and he was named Arizona’s best comedic writer by judges at the Tempe Improv.

So what is in store next for Jonathan Gregory? Well, I suppose that is the million dollar question. My guess: Prison or Conan."

36,http://nbc.com.co/personal-injury-claims-ford-explorer-rise/,nbc,Personal Injury Claims Against Ford Explorer On The Rise,"['Almira Anke', 'Hanif Ibrahim', 'Jacob Morgan']","What initially seemed like only a disgruntled few has grown into over 650,000 complaints to date against the makers of the 2011-2017 Ford Explorers. The claims are that there is a potential for deadly exhaust leaks and that hundreds of thousands of consumers have been subject to injury due to the faulty design of the Ford Explorer.

Consumers from many walks of life have described what they call “exhaust fumes” coming not from the exterior, but the cabin of their vehicle, and they are questioning what the exposure might be doing to passengers. Anyone who has ever been in a car realizes that being inside one provides very limited space, and if there is something harmful in the air, then everyone is affected to some extent.

To blame, evidently, is the Explorer’s air conditioner and the way that it circulates air while the driver presses the gas pedal. While accelerating, drivers and passengers alike have alleged that there is a very familiar “rotten egg” or “sulfur” smell that permeates the interior. According to experts who have investigated the complaints against the Ford company, the smell has been linked to an unsealed seam in the rear of the SUV.

Over 150 owners have filed lawsuits in court and with the NHTSA, which first launched the investigation to substantiate the claims that exhaust was being leaked into the cabin of the car. Obviously, the biggest concern is the potential exposure of vehicle occupants to carbon monoxide.

The original 150 claims have blossomed into over 450,000, some involving the 2016 models, while others are alleging that 2017 models are also affected. The additional claims have not been a part of the NHTSA’s original investigation into the exhaust allegations.

Ford has been aware of the exhaust issues since as early as 2012. At that point there is a record of the automaker providing bulletins to the dealers that there may, in fact, have been an exhaust problem. In 2015, it was escalated when a Ford Motor representative called it a “design issue,” admitting that there was some truth to the claims being made. The company, however, has not made any attempt to have a formal recall to fix the exhaust problem or to address the concerns of the Ford Explorer owners.

The claims made against the automaker by a personal injury houston attorney state, that while in the vehicle, passengers and drivers have experienced everything from passing out and suddenly crashing into a tree, to injuries such as bronchitis, burning eyes, headaches and childhood breathing issues. In other cars, the exhaust system vents harmful gases such as acrolein benzene, carbon monoxide, acetaldehyde and formaldehyde outside of the car. According to investigators, the defective Ford Explorer was improperly designed to have the vents go directly into the car’s interior.

Carbon monoxide has been linked to many ill health effects, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiovascular disease. If exposure is concentrated enough, it can lead to death. There has not been any conclusive evidence that anyone has been injured due to the defect in the design, which makes a personal injury suit difficult to initiate. But in August of 2016, Ford did agree to settle a class-action suit in Florida. Maybe this is an admission of negligence; many more claims appear to be pending.

Although many factors decide a verdict in a personal injury case including the amount of injury sustained, negligence is the main factor. If Explorer owners can conclusively show that they were exposed to harmful gases as a result of the way that the car was constructed, it might just be enough to charge Ford with personal injury suits, or at a minimum, a massive and expensive recall.

Until there is evidence that it is causing anyone harmful exposure, the claims will probably fall by the wayside. But if Ford settles out of court many more times, then they will be inadvertently admitting guilt and could be opening themselves up for some severe and serious compensatory payoffs at the very least."

Have you ever stopped to ask yourself why that person didn’t put the phone down and call for help o in any way help to stop it? Moreover, did you notice that there were tons of people standing around watching an incident, but no one stepped in?

Although you would assume that someone has a moral obligation to step in to stop violence and crime, the facts are that they have no legal responsibility to do anything. In Michigan, there are no laws that make it illegal to watch a crime being committed and to not take action. Local law enforcement might be disappointed and upset that people don’t feel the need to do anything, but they have no recourse against witnesses who don’t try to help.

It isn’t that getting a video of the incident isn’t a good idea for both the criminal prosecution of the people involved and for any resulting personal injury suits. It is just that the people in the video might be better served if someone put the camera down while someone else is taping, so that they can make a call to end it. We’re a society that has become gladiator spectators, where people seem more concerned with getting the best shot and the most likes on YouTube than they are with assisting fellow neighbors, friends, and strangers who need help.

When Detroit Police Chief James Craig stood in front of the cameras commenting on the latest online video fight, he admitted that although there was no recourse for those who stand by and commit crimes, it is nonetheless an offense. He also talked about an incident where a man and woman were stabbed in a fight, and barely anyone called 911 to report the incident.

Many legislators are looking at the recent incidents and wondering if there is something that they can do to stop the glorification of violence on social media sites. Many believe that the best way to curb increasing violence is to hold people accountable for not only participating in acts, but also to hold them accountable when they don’t at the very least take steps to call 911 for help. Obviously, you can’t force someone to step in and potentially put themselves into harm’s way, but creating legislation to at a minimum call 911 is not an unrealistic measure.

Currently, unless a Criminal lawyer in Boston MA can prove that a person is directly involved in a crime, then there is no potential for them to be held liable. If you are a bystander, and potentially not a very good person for not helping, that still doesn’t make you criminally liable for the actions of someone else.

The problem is that if legislators start to put rules into place about what an individual’s responsibility is to those around them, it could be a slippery slope that leads to people losing their right to freedom of choice. The government can’t legislate morality or tell someone when they have a legal responsibility to step in to help or to intervene. It isn’t reasonable that you could prosecute someone for being an innocent bystander in a crime.

If legislators try to compel people to step in, that could put those who intervene at risk. It isn’t just about physically intervening; it is a safety issue. What if a bystander calls 911 and there are repercussions for them in their community or neighborhood?

If it is a gang-related incident, the last thing that anyone wants to do is to punish someone for putting a video on the internet and not calling — if they failed to call out of fear of reprisal. If Michigan starts to legislate how to behave morally, then there is really no situation that the government can’t try to dictate.

The technicalities of technology and law continue to mount, with everything from cellphones and driving distracted to filming instead of calling law enforcement when someone is in trouble. The fact is that no matter what you think someone should morally do, you can’t legislate being a good person or taking personal responsibility for something that isn’t your problem or that you aren’t even involved in."

When Jimmies Are Not Being Rustled The Kind Dr. Enjoys Being An Amazing Husband To His Beautiful', 'Soulmate', 'Anastasia']","Washington, DC — President Barack Obama shocked the country today with news that he is running for a third term.

“I can’t abandon the American people now when they need me more than ever,” Obama told reporters at a press conference today. “We’ve come this far as a nation, now is not the time to do something different. This is the change you wanted and this is the change you’re getting.”

Presidential hopeful Rand Paul of Kentucky told NBC News he does not agree with Obama and his announcement.

“This defies everything the Constitution stands for,” Paul said. “We cannot let this man have a third term.”

In the history of this country only two presidents have served more than two terms, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin D, Roosevelt. The major problem for Obama when he runs in 2016, is the 22nd Amendment. In short, the 22nd Amendment states, “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice…”







The U.S. Constitution does make an exception in the 22nd Amendment though:

“This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several states within seven years from the date of its submission to the states by the Congress.”

This means Obama’s third term presidential run is only valid if he receives 75% approval from the Congress, though insiders say Obama plans to make an executive order to ratify this.

Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian anti-masturbation organization, told NBC News that the group is thrilled about Obama running for a third term.

“Obama has really done a lot to put pressure on Big Masturbation and I think a third term is exactly what he needs to put an end to masturbation in this country once and for all. I wish him the best of luck!”

Paul Horner, who is a spokesman for the Obama Administration, answered questions from reporters about their campaign strategy to achieve a third term in office.

“Obama is guaranteed to win in 2016. I mean seriously, will it even be close? The Republicans believe the Earth is only 6,000 years old and that Obama is a Muslim; and Hillary Clinton is, well, she’s Hillary Clinton. I don’t even think we’re going to have to campaign, we’ll probably just end up phoning this thing in. I think as long as Obama doesn’t die, he is a lock for President in 2016.”

When Jimmies Are Not Being Rustled The Kind Dr. Enjoys Being An Amazing Husband To His Beautiful', 'Soulmate', 'Anastasia']","HOLLYWOOD, CA (AP) — Breaking Bad fans around the world are celebrating the stunning, glorious and amazing news announced today: Walter White is not dead, and there will indeed be a sixth season of the wildly-popular, award-winning AMC drama.

This shocking and exciting news comes not from an internet message board or the rumor mill but from series creator Vince Gilligan. In an exclusive interview with NBC News, Gilligan dropped the bombshell.

“Walter White is not dead, and neither is Breaking Bad,” said the 47-year-old writer, director, and executive producer of the groundbreaking show.

“We’ve kept it under wraps for months, now the cat’s out of the bag. Season 6 is coming, and it’s going to be epic and true to the fans that have followed the show so incessantly.”







Gilligan explained his decision to continue with the popular series.

“I just couldn’t walk away from it. This isn’t a cash-grab or a sophomoric attempt to bastardize what was such a beautiful ending to season 5. I’ve invested so much of myself in these characters that I’d always had an inkling I’d return to it, even outside [the] Better Call Saul [spinoff]. The kicker was I’d need a spark, something that made it make sense for these stories to continue.”

The series star Bryan Cranston seemed to drop a major hint in an interview with CNN’s Ashleigh Banfield back in May. Asked by Banfield if his character, Walter White, died or not, Cranston said, “Hey, you never saw bags zip up or anything. Or say … you know.”

In response to questions about whether the character could show up in a movie or anywhere else ever again, Cranston said: “Never say never.”

Gilligan explained how the decision came about to do a season six.

“Bryan [Cranston] called me up and said he had this incredibly lucid dream in which Walt wakes up in a hospital bed surrounded by the DEA, ends up breaking out of prison and finds out he’s got fans,” Gilligan said. “This isn’t a redemption story, it’s got a bleak, dark premise. I can’t give away any more of the details, but let’s just say Walt has quite a bit of unfinished business to attend to, and it sure as hell has nothing to do with teaching high school science.”

According to Gilligan, the entire cast has principally agreed to return for at least one more season. This includes Bob Odenkirk, star of ‘Better Call Saul’, the prequel comedy series which finished season one over at AMC.

“I’m not surprised in the least that Vince is going back to Breaking Bad,” said Odenkirk. “I’ve been working with him on set for a long time, and the last few times I’ve seen him, he’s had sort of a glint in his eye, a bounce to his step. He’s laughing at a bunch of jokes I couldn’t pull off two years ago. I mean, comedy and drama can be radically different, and no one does drama like Vince. I’m completely on board.”







Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward , a group that gives out donated new socks to the homeless, told NBC News she is excited that Gilligan will be featuring the group in the upcoming season.

“I’m just thrilled that Vine [Gilligan] is using our name and group in season six of Breaking Bad,” Bradley said. “We have so many great scenes and dialogue in season six, it is so fantastic. This will definitely increase the amount of donations we receive and put so many more brand new pairs of socks on the feet of homeless people. Please give what you can, every bit helps so much .”

Paul Horner, a Breaking Bad writer since season one, upon hearing the announcement by Gilligan confirmed the news with NBC News.

“Yes, it’s true. You don’t know how much of a relief this is to finally get this off my back. I’ve been keeping this a secret for two long months now, I was ready to explode,” he said. “Here’s a little spoiler for all you fans out there so stop reading right now if you don’t want any information, otherwise, lets go. Season six begins with Walt waking up in the hospital, handcuffed to his bed. Like Bryan [Cranston] said last May, nobody ever saw a body bag, so essentially, the last episode of Season 5 was left open-ended. Skyler, Walt Jr., Marie… none of them have any idea he’s survived, but the DEA is right on top of it. We’ll go through the motions of people finding out he’s alive – many people wanted Walt dead, so there’s a lot of disconcerted, angry people out there. We have Walt going to trial, his incarceration and how he’s keeping Heisenberg and the blue meth on the streets during his imprisonment. Season 6 will have Walt’s eventual breakout, despite the fact that he’s being held prisoner in a fashion not seen since Hannibal Lecter. The nationwide manhunt for Jesse Pinkman is both epic and gripping, and I can tell you for certain his relationship with Walt will continue, in a much more strained, arch-nemesis-type fashion. None of this is anything you won’t find out about in the trailer, but it’s high time to get truly, truly excited for the greatest show of all time! I believe in this, it’s a valid and worthwhile continuation of something that deserves discernment and care. Breaking Bad Season 6! It’s not over yet!”

For comedic relief in season 6, a Christian anti-masturbation organization’s mascot named Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin will be joining the crew. Fappy, played by newcomer 36-year-old Paul Horner from Phoenix, Arizona, told NBC News he is excited about the role.

“I’m not familiar with the show, honestly if it’s not in the Bible I probably haven’t heard about it,” Horner said. “A couple months ago, the great Lonnie Childs, president of Stop Masturbation Now, contacted me and asked if I wanted to be in one of those moving picture shows about breaking stuff badly and smoking methamphetamine. I told him I had never tried meth before, but had heard good things. I also told him I was interested in the part, but just as long as the breaking show had no self-rape or homogayness in it. He assured me it didn’t, so I said, sure, why not!” Horner continued, “I think this is a perfect platform to help spread awareness about the dangers and consequences of masturbation. This is going to be so much fun! Praise Lonnie Childs! Praise Fappy!”

The original series won multiple awards, including ten Primetime Emmys. Out of 267 nominations, Breaking Bad has garnered 101 trophies. Shooting for Breaking Bad: Season 6 is scheduled to begin December, 2015.

46,http://nbc.com.co/hate-crimes-rise-since-trump-took-office/,nbc,Are Hate Crimes On The Rise Since Trump Took Office?,"['Almira Anke', 'Hanif Ibrahim', 'Jacob Morgan']","Whether you are in favor of or against the Trump Administration and its policies, there aren’t many who don’t have an opinion. Due to current events both in America and abroad, some insist that an anti-Muslim sentiment is fostered and is only enhanced by Trump’s attempt at an immigration ban from countries which are predominantly Muslim. The recent Portland stabbing incident is only further making people wonder whether hate crimes are getting worse in America.

Last Friday, Destinee Mangum and her Muslim friend, who was wearing a hijab — the traditional Muslim head covering, — were riding on a train and minding their own business. Joseph Christian, a 35-year-old Portland native, began yelling racial slurs at the two young girls. The girls fled the area, afraid that things would escalate. Christian was quite incensed and using ethnic slurs against not just Muslims but other religions and ethnicities, according to the girls and corroborated by the other train passengers.

Bystanders on the train began to step in to defend the two girls, and what happened was something that no one saw coming. Christian began stabbing the people who were asking him to stop his verbal assault. Ricky John Best, a retired military professional, and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche were two men that died as a result of the altercation that ensued. A third victim, 21-year-old Micah Fletcher, was also severely injured.

Dyjuana Hudson, Mangum’s mother, officially sent out a statement thanking those who protected her daughter that day. After the stabbings, Christian was chased by several eyewitnesses and was caught by law enforcement. He has been charged with attempted murder and two counts of aggravated murder. It hasn’t been announced yet whether prosecutors will seek hate crime charges against him. Apparently, this was not the first time that Christian went on a tirade on the same train. Reports say that he had done it the day before, but no one stepped in.

After his arrest, his Facebook account painted a picture of a man who was a member of just about every racist organization that he could find. Compounding the tragedy, the incident happened right at the beginning of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month. Although Trump condemned the act, many believe that it is the Trump Administration that is increasing the incidents of bigoted acts across the nation. Some political pundits would suggest that Trump has sent out Islamophobic, anti-immigration and racist Tweets, and they are only perpetuating the increase in hate crimes.

It isn’t just the Portland attack that is concerning many; there was also an incident at the University of Maryland involving the stabbing of African-American students by other (white) students, mosques have reportedly been burned down, and there have been drive-by shootings in Tulsa related to an LGBTQ organization.

So are hate crimes on the rise?

It is hard to discern, because there simply isn’t enough data tracked related to the number of hate crimes across the nation. What a criminal lawyer in Dallas has noticed is that there does seem to be, is a rise in anti-Muslim hate crimes in America over the past couple of years.

According to the latest statistics, the Federal Bureau of Investigation found that there was a reported 7% rise in hate crimes in 2015 alone, with a 67% increase in hate crimes that were reported by Muslims. The problem is that unless they are successfully prosecuted, hate crimes are nothing more than subjective. Until better statistics are kept and analyzed, the presumption that they are on the rise is only conjecture.

There is no doubt that anti-Muslim fear is on the rise, but whether it is resulting in more hate crimes is debatable. It is difficult to watch all the violence around the globe traced back to Muslims and not be a little concerned when you see traditional Muslim dress. It is also not clear if the increase has anything to do with the Trump Administration. It is likely a result of what is going on globally."
47,http://nbc.com.co/push-cap-damages-medical-malpractice-horizon/,nbc,Push To Cap Damages For Medical Malpractice On Horizon,"['Almira Anke', 'Hanif Ibrahim', 'Jacob Morgan']","Big changes may be on the horizon for the state of medicine in America. Changes to Obamacare have just been proposed that would take away the tax imposition for those who don’t carry health insurance. Just one of the three-part changes promised by the Trump Administration, the health insurance industry is not the only healthcare system that will likely be challenged and altered over the next several years. Another possible change is a push to cap damages awarded by the courts for medical malpractice.

Insurance costs for physicians have skyrocketed over the past several decades. Doctors are increasingly worried about the decisions they make, due to the risk of being sued for malpractice. Being guided by lawsuits, however, might not be doing the patients any favors. Legislation is slated to hit the House Committee that would make it harder for patients to be awarded large sums of money due to malpractice.

Already approved by the House Judiciary Committee, the new legislation would put a cap on the damages allowed for victims of malpractice. The measure would include nursing homes, hospitals and physicians alike. Many states already have caps in place for recovering for malpractice. The legislation would encompass patients on Medicaid, Veterans or Military Health recipients, Medicare and those who are covered under the Affordable Care Act, along with those who either have health saving plans or COBRA for their health insurance coverage.

Leading the charge is Iowa Representative Steve King (R). He believes the medical profession should use malpractice suits to prevent further mistakes in the healthcare industry.

Like many other issues in the US, malpractice caps appear to fall along political lines. Democrats are enraged by the proposed cap on damages. Representatives like Ted Deutch believe that the legal system should work to compensate those who are injured, not be used for teaching purposes.

Obviously, those who are lobbying for the medical industry and medical professionals are delighted about the legislation and would love to see a cap in place. A legal malpractice attorney Atlanta, believe that many malpractice awards are out of control and not comparable to the damages that result. They also believe that the high awards negatively impact the health care that people receive and lead to decisions based more on fear of litigation than on common-sense medicine.

What has really incensed the Democrats who voted against the cap measure is that only specific insurance coverage has been singled out to cap awards. For those who can afford private insurance, it appears that there is no limit to their damage recovery. That unfairly disadvantages veterans and those who are dependent upon state-run health care programs, which creates a systematic bias in medical malpractice litigation.

Also at issue is the rapid movement of the bill’s passage. The bill has been up for review numerous times over the course of the past several decades and has always been voted down. The expeditiousness of the bill this time around is likely due to the Republican predominance in both houses.

Many believe the bill will not only shield doctors from medical mistakes, but also cover pharmaceutical companies for personal injury suits. It will also put caps on the damages that pharmaceutical companies are compelled to pay when someone is injured. That could lead to dangerous drugs being allowed in the marketplace far longer than they should be.

It might also give immunity to drug companies when patients are harmed by FDA-approved drugs, which could mean that many who are injured by mass-produced medicines would not be eligible to receive fair compensation.

Although it doesn’t put a cap on recovery for economic damages, the bill would top out the amount that patients are entitled to for their pain and suffering to a maximum of $250,000. Many legislators believe that will unfairly disadvantage children and the elderly. Since those two populations would suffer minimal economic damages, they would be disproportionately awarded less for their malpractice suits.

Putting a cap on what patients of malpractice can be granted, especially according to their insurance coverage, might be doing the least-served populations a disservice and further put them at an economic advantage. Many lawmakers wonder who is winning more: the drug companies or healthcare companies who have been lobbying for this type of measure for decades."
48,http://yournewswire.com/john-kerry-calls-for-russia-and-syria-war-crimes-investigation/,newsbbc,John Kerry Calls For Russia And Syria War Crimes Investigation,['Black Swan'],"The US secretary of state John Kerry has called for Russia and Syria to face “war crimes” investigations for bombing of civilian targets.

“Russia, and the regime, owe the world more than an explanation about why they keep hitting hospitals and medical facilities and children,” he said.

Kerry also claimed that Syrian forces hit “another hospital” in Aleppo overnight, killing 20 people and wounding 100. There has been no confirmation of the attack from either government or rebel sources.

#SYRIA: @JohnKerry says regime strike last night on Syria hospital killed 20 people, wounded 100+, but SOHR says it has no record of attack — Maya Gebeily (@GebeilyM) October 7, 2016

He said Russian and Syrian government attacks on hospitals were “beyond the accidental” and part of a deliberate strategy in war-torn Syria.

“This is a targeted strategy to terrorise civilians and to kill anybody and everybody who is in the way of their military objective”.

RT reports:

Syrian jets, backed by the Russian air force, are targeting militants in East Aleppo after jihadist groups in control of the enclave there repeatedly violated the cessation of hostilities, according to Moscow and Damascus.

UN estimates put the number of militants in East Aleppo between six and eight thousand, said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, about half of whom belong to the terrorist organization Al-Nusra Front. Russia is prepared to urge the Syrian government to let them depart the city, Lavrov added.

UN’s envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, personally offered to escort the militants out.

“If you [Al-Nusra] did decide to leave, in dignity with your weapons, to Idlib or anywhere you wanted to go, I personally am ready, physically ready, to accompany you,” he said on Thursday.

Kerry’s words were an attempt to distract from Washington’s failure to implement the Syrian ceasefire, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Friday.

“Kerry’s statement – this is propaganda. There are some very serious legal consequences behind this terminology, and I think that Kerry used all of these terms to inflame the situation,” Zakharova said.

“If it comes to war crimes, US representatives should start with Iraq. And then move to Libya, and of course to Yemen – find out what’s there. I want to say that juggling these words is very dangerous, because there are indeed war crimes on the part of the American representatives,” Zakharova told Dozhd TV.

Washington suspended bilateral contacts with Russia over the Syrian crisis on Monday, accusing Moscow of not doing enough to restrain the government in Damascus. The Foreign Ministry in Moscow said that Russia had made every effort to preserve the September 9 ceasefire agreement, while repeatedly urging Washington to live up to its obligations and separate the so-called “moderate opposition” fighters from Al-Nusra and other terrorists.

Kerry’s remarks come as the Syrian Army made advances in the Sheikh Saeed district of Aleppo, on the southern side of the rebel-held enclave. Even as government bombardment has lessened, shelling from the rebel side killed 11 people in the government-held Al-Jamaliyeh neighborhood on Thursday.

Authorities in Damascus have said “there is no other option” but to continue to fight the rebels until they leave Aleppo."
49,http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/what-is-a-raw-vegan-diet/?a_aid=54e3fadc2316d,newsbbc,What Is a Raw Vegan Diet?,['L. A. Mcdonough'],"When developing a raw vegan diet, or any diet for that matter, you should focus on choosing foods that provide your body with the five most essential types of nutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, fats, minerals, and vitamins. Fortunately, these essential nutrients are present in a wide range of fruits, vegetables, herbs, and plants, so it is actually pretty easy to create a diet for yourself that is highly varied, palatable, and rich in nutritious value. Additionally, consuming these foods in raw form adds additional vitality and enzymes to your body because cooking removes many essential nutrients from foods. Organic, raw foods are also free from many of the preservatives that are added to foods that are intended for traditional recipe cooking.

Carbohydrates for Vegans

Carbohydrates are the first nutrient group to mention and raw, leafy green vegetables are the best source of complex carbohydrates for vegans. Complex carbohydrates take longer to break down and enter your blood stream. This allows the body to absorb them slowly and to use them more efficiently. Legumes are another excellent source of complex carbohydrates that also help maintain constant, healthy blood sugar levels.

Protein for Vegans

Although meat is usually thought to be the primary (or only) source of protein, incorporating protein into a raw vegan diet isn’t nearly as difficult as you may think. Protein is much more abundant in plant material than people have been raised to believe. Our civilization and the advertising wizards who pull the strings have promoted a myth that a plant-based diet is unable to deliver all of the protein a person requires. This is not based on fact, but rather, on a desire to promote meat as a food source for economic gain. In actuality, protein is abundant in many types of vegetable sprouts. Broccoli sprouts, for instance, contain 35% protein, while pea sprouts contain 25% protein.

Many of the same leafy green vegetables from which we gain complex carbohydrates also provide us with protein. Broccoli and kale both consist of 45% protein, while spinach consists of 30 percent protein. Eating these vegetables this will also enrich your body with essential minerals, vitamins, and amino acids which we will examine more closely in a moment.

Nuts and seeds are two fabulous sources of protein for the raw vegan diet. Seeds make excellent, filling snacks between meals and are also a source for the essential fats required by the human body. Almonds are 12% protein per ounce. Pumpkin seeds consist of 21% protein per seed, while hemp seeds consist of 22% protein. A lesser known food source, but protein rich at the same time, is Spirulina, a type of algae. It is almost 68% protein—more than any land-based plant life. It also contains fatty acids and appears to have detoxification qualities as well. Another algae, Chlorella, is 60% protein and also possesses certain tissue repair properties.

Fats for Vegans

There’s no harm in avoiding unhealthy saturated fats but certain types of healthy fats are necessary for a healthy raw vegan diet. These fats can be obtained from many of the nuts and seeds mentioned previously. You can also get them from organic, raw avocados, and milk substitutes made from nuts and oily seeds. Hemp milk and almond milk, for instance, are two of the healthiest dairy substitutes that anyone can consume, vegan or otherwise. Avocados should be consumed independently from sweet and starchy foods in order to prevent the body from craving excessive amounts of sugar.

Minerals for Vegans

It is also necessary to make sure that your raw vegan diet contains plenty of essential minerals. The most important of these minerals is calcium, followed by iron, magnesium, and a host of others. The following lists is a handy reference chart of plant sources for each type of mineral the body requires.

50,http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-06/leaked-memo-confirms-hillary-was-given-questions-ahead-interview,newsbbc,Leaked Memo Confirms Hillary Was Given Questions Ahead Of Interview,"['Chris Dakota', 'Not Verified', 'Lance-A-Lot', 'Main_Sequence']","Yesterday, in the latest indication that few things involving Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign are left to chance, we reported that Brennan Leach, a child actor and daughter of a PA Democratic Senator, was used to ask staged questions at a recent Hillary town hall. And while there has been some unconfirmed speculation that the Democratic presidential candidate may have colluded with Lester Holt during her first presidential debate, we now have further proof that ""preparation"" for Hillary means being fully informed of what is about to take place well ahead of time.

According to a leaked memo obtained by the Washington Free Beacon, the Clinton campaign was sent all questions one week by the program before the interview between Clinton and Harvey on Feb. 17. The memo was sent by campaign spokeswoman Karen Finney, formerly an MSNBC host, and communications staffer Betsaida Alcantara. In it the Clinton aides wrote one week before the taping that ""Steve is known to be a host who goes out of his way to make his guests feel comfortable. We coordinated closely with the show’s producers on the script and format of the show.”

The memo was attached to an email posted on the website DCLeaks.com. According to the Free Beacon, one of the individuals behind the website - which has been alleged of working with the Russian government - provided the website with a password to access that email and others sent to and from Clinton volunteer Beanca Nicholson, who was doing advance work for a campaign swing through Chicago that included the Harvey interview.

According to the memo, Clinton’s staff saw Harvey’s show as an effective and low-risk way to reach out to female and African American voters. They also noted recent episodes of the show that focused on issues that Clinton had stressed during her campaign. ""Clinton’s staff pitched the show on some of those issues, including gun control, and noted that Harvey would not likely force Clinton to go into detail defending her positions"" the WFB notes.

Questions included were about Clinton’s granddaughter, the former secretary of State's pizza preferences (thin crust versus deep dish) and her support of gun control policies.

""Please note that the tone of the show is generally light so even on policy questions, Steve won’t go too deep into details,” the memo read.

The campaign and the Harvey's producers also coordinated on which parts of Clinton’s biography would be introduced and how.

“During this segment Steve will take a trip down memory lane with YOU to talk about the different moments of YOUR life displayed in the photographs below,” the memo stated.

In the most amusing moment during the interview, Clinton acted ""surprised"" when the photos were placed on screen. “Oh boy. Oh my goodness,” she said when a photo of her at 12-years-old was placed on the screen.

Harvey also filmed segments for a special on the Flint water crisis that would air about four weeks later during the same taping session. Once again, Clinton was briefed ahead of time on the questions that Harvey would ask, including one on her February visit to the Michigan city and on efforts to address crime and joblessness.

One week later, Harvey endorsed Clinton for president.

After the report hit, a Harvey spokesperson sent the Washington Free Breacon the following statement: “As happens with many shows like ours, producers conduct pre-interviews highlighting areas of interest and possible questions. This allows the guests to prepare for their appearance and provides the most informative experience for the viewers.”"
51,http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/healthy-lifestyle-changes-to-make-today/,newsbbc,6 Healthy Lifestyle Changes to Make Today,['L. A. Mcdonough'],"Over the years, I’ve helped thousands of people make better choices for their life and their health. People from all backgrounds say they feel sick, tired, and depressed. What’s truly scary is that people begin to accept that feeling as normal.

It doesn’t have to be that way. You don’t have to, nor should you, resign yourself to feeling perpetually run-down and exhausted. Some of the most effective ways to improve your health are simple and accessible to almost everyone. You don’t need a lot of money; you just need the drive to cultivate healthy habits. When people ask me what the best medicine is, do you know what I tell them? The best medicine is a prevention-based lifestyle.

6 Tips for a Healthy Lifestyle

The six simplest things you can incorporate in your life are sunshine, clean air, fresh water, sleep, exercise, and most of all— a clean, healthy diet. That’s it. Improving these six things can improve anyone’s health. They require no fancy equipment, no special training, no 16-disc instructional DVD set, no payment plan. You can start improving your life yourself, today, right now.

1. Get Some Sunshine

Soaking up the sun has received a lot of bad press in recent years, and everyone now associates the sun’s UV rays with wrinkles and skin cancer. While it’s true that you shouldn’t spend all day in the sun, we’ve swung too far in the other direction, and people are quick to reach for chemically-suspect sunscreens or avoid the sun entirely. In reality, UV rays account for only about one-tenth of 1% of the total global burden of disease. You’re far more likely to get sick from too little sunlight.[1]

Moderate exposure to direct sunshine boosts the health of both your mind and body. In addition to enhancing your mental state, exposure to sunlight directly affects the body’s production of melatonin and can promote more restful sleep. Sunlight is also vital to the body’s ability to produce vitamin D, an incredibly important nutrient that supports cardiovascular health, bone health, and the immune system. In fact, sunlight is the best source of vitamin D, as the nutrient is relatively uncommon in food.

That’s not to say you should ignore the risk of UV-related cancer. As in all things health-related, you must find the right balance. Be smart about your level of sunshine exposure. Try to get at least 15-30 minutes of direct sunlight every day. Avoid sunscreens. At best, they prevent vitamin D production. Worse, many sunscreens contain harsh chemicals that can be absorbed through the skin and cause dozens of health problems. If you are out in the glaring sun all day, make use of shade and wear sunglasses, wide-brimmed hats, and loose-fitting, long-sleeved clothing to avoid sunburn. If you must use sunscreen, only buy organic, mineral and plant-based varieties.

2. Breathe Clean Air

As the old saying goes, you can survive weeks without food, days without water, but only a few minutes without air. Given its extreme importance, it almost goes without saying that the best air is fresh and clean.

Clean air helps prevent respiratory ailments like asthma or allergies and supplies your body with the oxygen that all living cells need. Breathing dirty air can cause big problems.

A lot of people associate poor air quality with smog or industrial pollution. You may be surprised to learn that, according to the EPA, indoor air quality is usually 2-5x worse than that outside. That may be a best-case scenario; in the worst cases, indoor air can be up to 100x more toxic.[2]

Oddly, efficient construction may be to blame. It’s energy efficient for a building to be sealed up tight, but it also allows for the accumulation and concentration of air pollutants. These pollutants include the VOCs and chemical fumes that off-gas from furniture, paint, flooring materials, and other indoor building materials.

Don’t think an air freshener is going to “clean” the air. Most air fresheners just release an equally toxic chemical fragrance to mask odors.[3] Instead, get an air purification device for your home, preferably one that uses both HEPA and UV filters. You can also open the windows and get a few houseplants; they’re excellent, natural air filters that release clean oxygen. Better yet, go outside in nature and enjoy the fresh air first hand.

3. Stay Hydrated

By some estimates, 75% of people suffer from chronic mild dehydration.[4] This affects your health in more ways than just feeling a bit thirsty. At a minimum, chronic dehydration causes a severe drop in your energy levels. Worse, since 70% of your body is water, dehydration can negatively affect every process in your body, including bone and tissue regeneration, natural detoxification abilities, immune function—all of it. Even blinking your eyes and the beating of your heart require water.

Madison Avenue marketing wizards spend millions of dollars trying to convince us that water is plain and boring. Instead, they say, we should quench our thirst with overpriced, carbonated liquid candy like soda and energy drinks. Don’t listen. You need fresh water to function; there is no substitute. Coffee, sodas, and energy drinks are not good sources of hydration. In fact, the caffeine and sugar are diuretics that cause your body to lose water. Avoid.

How much water do you need? Eight cups a day is the standard recommendation. That’s a fairly good rule of thumb, but it doesn’t account for body size or activity level. A better guideline is to drink half your bodyweight in ounces. For example, if you weigh 180 pounds, drink 90 ounces of water per day. Of course, people’s needs differ based on many factors. Body size, physical activity, external temperature, sweatiness, health, and dozens of other factors all affect how much water you need. Start with the half-your-weight rule as a base and add water as needed.

4. Get Enough Rest

Have you noticed that in some circles, missing several hours of sleep a night is considered a badge of honor while sleeping the full, recommended 8 hours is seen as a weakness? This thinking is completely backward.

Adequate sleep—about 7-8 hours a night for most people—is absolutely necessary for a healthy body and mind. Rest promotes normal hormone levels and neurotransmitter responses. Skipping sleep can lead to poor work performance, car accidents, relationship problems, anger, and depression.[5]

Why are so many people walking around completely exhausted? For most people, the problem isn’t that they’re too busy, it’s that they just need to turn off the TV, put down the phone, and close their eyes. In fact, trying to fall asleep with the TV or other gadgets on will only derail your body’s natural circadian rhythm.[6]

Just put away the smartphone and go to bed. Make your sleeping space as dark as possible. If that’s not feasible, try wearing a sleep mask. It’s a great strategy for blocking out light. And, just as you’ve always heard, aim for about 8 hours of sleep every night.

5. Exercise Often

Exercise is vital to your health and mood. Unequivocally, research shows that your chances of living a long, healthy life are better if you exercise regularly. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services advises that regular physical activity reduces mortality rates of many chronic diseases and helps improve or prevent many illnesses and conditions.[7]

You don’t need to have the physique of an Olympian to see health benefits. Even light to moderate exercise can offer tremendous health benefits. Although forty-five minutes to an hour is better for most people, just 30 minutes of moderate activity a few times a week can boost energy levels, help you sleep better, sharpen your mind, and strengthen your defense against illness.

To maximize the benefits, exercise outdoors. Studies have shown that exercising outside promotes endurance, enthusiasm, pleasure, and self-esteem. It also helps reduce depression and fatigue.[8] One study found that people who exercised outside exercised longer and more frequently.[9] Not to mention that exercising outdoors can also help you get your daily dose of sunshine.

6. Follow a Clean Diet

You may be familiar with the expression, “garbage in, garbage out.” The food you eat is a perfect example of that expression in action. Good nutrition is vital to your health. You can exercise and sleep twice as much as anyone else, but without a clean and balanced diet, you will feel down and fatigued.

There are many, many schools of thought on what type of diet is the best. Although there are a few unshakeable principles, it has to be an individual choice. Personally, I both follow and recommend a raw, vegan diet, but everyone has to decide what works for their life.

Most of the animals raised for mass production are raised in squalid conditions and treated inhumanely. Not only is this unnecessarily cruel, but it also promotes diseased animals that yield toxic animal products. A plant-based diet avoids these dangers, but if you do decide to consume meat and dairy, at least avoid the worst of it. Only consume animal products that are produced organically, in a free range environment, with ethical standards in place.

And, while it’s a contentious topic, I believe there’s more than sufficient evidence to avoid genetically modified food, AKA GMOs.[10] Italy, France, Germany, Greece, and dozens of other countries have limited or outright banned these foods. In the United States, however, they are everywhere. Buying organic food is the easiest way to avoid GMOs. According to both U.S. and Canadian law, a product with the “100% Certified Organic” label, it cannot contain any genetically modified organisms.

Finally, get in the habit of making your own food and avoid the mass-produced food products that are usually found in the center of the grocery store—boxed, packaged, and loaded with junk, especially refined carbohydrates. A few years ago, researchers at Princeton even confirmed that sugar is more addictive than heroin. It’s no surprise Americans buy more soda than water.[11]

Most of your grocery shopping should consist of whole, raw foods. Vegetables, fruit, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. I won’t say all prepackaged food is terrible for you, but the vast majority of them contain a minefield of suspect ingredients.

At the so-called Opening Day event, backers can—at the $1 million sponsorship level—score perks like a photo op with The Donald and a multi-day hunting trip with his two eldest sons. Donald Jr (“Don”) and Eric think it’s a lot of fun to kill defenseless wild animals for sport, and apparently the entire family believes that hunting is part of “the great American tradition of outdoor sporting,” along with “fishing and conservation.”

Given Trump’s position on climate change, we’re not sure what they mean by “conservation,” but we do know spending $1 million for direct access to the president and a hunting trip with the first sons seems like a far cry from the American dream. Yet, here we are, living in a world where the Trump family is sending out invitations for rich folks to buy in to the bastardization of the presidency. At the $1-million sponsorship level, dubbed “The Bald Eagle,” contributors also receive access to a private reception (VIP access to the POTUS, that is) and autographed guitars from one of the musical performers at the fundraising event.

Don and Eric Trump, the two eldest sons of the president-elect, have a solid history as big game hunters and are the responsible parties behind the new Texas-based nonprofit organization hosting this insane party, according to the Center for Public Integrity. Back in 2012 when their father was still known as a real estate mogul or perhaps just a reality TV star, a series of photos of the men circulated online. They posed with their kills after a hunting trip in Zimbabwe, and perhaps the most memorable shot shows the two brothers standing side-by-side sporting huge pearly grins while holding up the limp body of a leopard.

According to the TMZ report which broke the news of the party, country singer Toby Keith and the band Alabama are reportedly on deck to perform to an audience of guests donning a “Camouflage and Cufflinks” dress code (whatever that is). A leaked draft of the invitation promises that “all net proceeds from the Opening Day event will be donated to conservation charities” but, as CPI points out, those charity organizations have not been named and the nonprofit is not legally bound to identify them—or the names of the donors.

Any takers on a bet that Kanye West will buy in at the Bald Eagle level?

Dramatic public statement says series of recent leaks which have revealed

Hillary Clinton's campaign attacked Donald's Trump's friendliness towards Russia on Friday after the US government formally accused the country of recent cyber attacks related to the election.

The Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence announced in a joint statement that they were confident Russia's 'senior-most officials' ordered the attacks and seemingly accused Vladimir Putin of interference in the American political system.

It is impossible for such an explosive charge to have been made without authorization from President Obama.

On Friday evening, the Clinton camp tweeted: 'It should concern every American that Russia is willing to engage in such hostile acts in order to help Donald Trump become president.'

A statement from John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chair, questioned why Trump 'continues to make apologies for the Russians.'

Hillary Clinton's campaign attacked Donald's Trump's friendliness towards Russia on Friday after the US government formally accused the country of recent cyber attacks related to the election

The US government announced in a statement that they were confident Russia's 'senior-most officials' ordered the attacks and seemingly accused Vladimir Putin (above) of interference in the American political system

'The world now knows, beyond the shadow of any doubt, that the hack of the Democratic National Committee was carried out by the Russian government in a clear attempt to interfere with the integrity of our elections,' Podesta's statement reads.

'The only remaining question is why Donald Trump continues to make apologies for the Russians.

'Trump's initial reaction to the hack in July was to invite further intrusions by the Russians. Even after he was reportedly briefed on the very findings that were just announced publicly by U.S. government officials, he stood on a debate stage one week ago and played dumb about Russia's role in this hack.'

Podesta said that Trump has repeatedly 'praised Vladimir Putin, outlined a list of pro-Putin policies, and has done hundreds of millions of dollars of business with Russian interests.

'But even worse, Trump's own actions suggests he welcomes the help,' the statement reads. 'If he wants to reassure American voters, he must not only acknowledge and condemn Russia's role in this outrageous intrusion against U.S. interests, but he must finally disclose the full extent of his ties to Russia and divest any Russian-linked assets.'

Hillary Clinton's campaign tweeted the above message Friday evening

A statement from John Podesta (above), Clinton's campaign chair, questioned why Trump 'continues to make apologies for the Russians.'

The claim that leaks were the result of an operation ordered by 'senior-most Russian officials' would have to have been authorized by President Obama, who voted early electronically in the presidential election hours before it was issued

The joint statement issued by the US government earlier on Friday said it was 'confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.

'We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.'

It added: 'It would be extremely difficult for someone, including a nation-state actor, to alter actual ballot counts or election results by cyber attack or intrusion.

'This assessment is based on the decentralized nature of our election system in this country and the number of protections state and local election officials have in place. States ensure that voting machines are not connected to the Internet, and there are numerous checks and balances as well as extensive oversight at multiple levels built into our election process.'

The condemnation came amid escalating tensions between Washington and Moscow over a range of international disagreements, including U.S. charges that Russian air strikes in support of embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have been hitting hospitals and other civilian targets in rebel-held eastern Aleppo.

California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the vice-chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that '[t]he administration's acknowledgement that Russian intelligence agencies are attempting to influence the U.S. election and undermine public confidence conveys the seriousness of the threat.

'Attempted hacking of our election system is intolerable, and it's critical to convince the Russian government to cease these activities. If it does not, we must develop a strong response.'

Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who is Feinstein's counterpart in the House of Representatives, said in a statement on Friday that 'I applaud the administration's decision to publicly name Russia as the source of hacks into U.S. political institutions.'

'We should now work with our European allies who have been the victim of similar and even more malicious cyber interference by Russia to develop a concerted response that protects our institutions and deters further meddling.'

A 400-pound man named Ivan? Donald Trump downplayed the possibility of Russia's involvement in the hacks during the first presidential debate, saying it might have been China – or 'somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds'

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will be left to explain himself on Sunday during the second presidential debate.

In his first head-to-head with Clinton, he claimed Russia's purported involvement in the series of high-profile computer hacks was by no means a given.

'I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC,' he said.

'She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't – maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, okay?'

'Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over,' Trump claimed.

In August, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters flatly: 'It is the Russians.'

She called the attack on the DNC an 'electronic Watergate' akin to the 1972 burglary at Democratic Party headquarters in the Watergate office building that upended the Nixon presidency. 'This is a break-in.'"
54,http://freebeacon.com/politics/clinton-campaign-helped-script-steve-harvey-interview/,newsbbc,Clinton Campaign Helped Script Steve Harvey Interview,['Lachlan Markay'],"BY: Follow @lachlan



Talk show host Steve Harvey provided Hillary Clinton’s campaign with the exact questions he would ask of Clinton during a February interview, according to an internal campaign memo sent a week before the interview and obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.

""Steve is known to be a host who goes out of his way to make his guests feel comfortable,"" two of Clinton’s top communications aides wrote in a memo to Clinton a week ahead of her interview. ""We coordinated closely with the show’s producers on the script and format of the show.""

The memo, sent to Clinton on Feb. 17, 2016, by campaign spokeswoman Karen Finney and communications aide Betsaida Alcantara, was attached to an email posted on the website DCLeaks.com by hackers suspected of acting in concert with the Russian government.

One of the individuals behind the website provided the Free Beacon with a password to access that email and others sent to and from Clinton volunteer Beanca Nicholson, who was doing advance work for a campaign swing through Chicago that included the Harvey interview.

The campaign memo reveals that Clinton’s staff worked with Harvey to craft the structure of the interview, and briefed the Democratic presidential nominee ahead of time on the precise wording of Harvey’s questions.

The questions touched on Clinton’s granddaughter, her preference for deep dish or thin crust pizza, her campaign’s ""great start,"" efforts to bridge America’s racial divide, and her support for gun control policies.

According to the memo, Clinton’s staff saw Harvey’s show as an effective and low-risk way to reach out to female and African American voters. They also noted recent episodes of the show that focused on issues that Clinton had stressed during her campaign.

Clinton’s staff pitched the show on some of those issues, including gun control, and noted that Harvey would not likely force Clinton to go into detail defending her positions.

""Please note that the tone of the show is generally light so even on policy questions, Steve won’t go too deep into details,"" the memo noted.

The campaign and the show’s producers also agreed ahead of time on the structure of a segment that would explore Clinton’s biography and achievements.

""During this segment Steve will take a trip down memory lane with YOU to talk about the different moments of YOUR life displayed in the photographs below,"" the memo explained photos of Clinton that Harvey pulled up on screen as she discussed her childhood, education, relationship with her husband, and election to the U.S. Senate.

Clinton feigned surprise throughout the interview. ""Oh boy. Oh my goodness,"" she exclaimed as Harvey displayed a photo of her at 12 years old.

Harvey also filmed segments for a special on the Flint water crisis that would air about four weeks later during the same taping session. Once again, Clinton was briefed ahead of time on the questions that Harvey would ask, including one on her February visit to the Michigan city and on efforts to address crime and joblessness.

Requests for comment sent to Harvey’s personal email address and the address listed on his website were not returned. The Clinton campaign did not return a request for comment.

Update: After publication, a Harvey spokesperson sent the following statement: ""As happens with many shows like ours, producers conduct pre-interviews highlighting areas of interest and possible questions. This allows the guests to prepare for their appearance and provides the most informative experience for the viewers."""

Rex Tillerson, the former chairman and chief executive officer of ExxonMobil, testifies during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing to become U.S. Secretary of State on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 11, 2017 Kevin Lamarque—Reuters

China’s state media has responded forcefully to suggestions by U.S. Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson that China should be barred from the artificial islands it has built in the South China Sea, warning that any such attempt would force a “devastating confrontation” and both sides should “prepare for a military clash.""

On Wednesday, Tillerson told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Beijing’s ongoing island-building strategy in the busy waterway — through which $5 trillion of trade passes annually — was illegal and “akin to Russia’s taking of Crimea.”

“We’re going to have to send China a clear signal that, first, the island-building stops,” the former ExxonMobil CEO told the hearing. “And second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed.”

Beijing claims sovereignty over almost 90% of the South China Sea, competing with neighbors Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei, who also claim parts of the waterway. In a bid to bolster its presence, China has transformed seven reefs and islets through reclamation into artificial islands. The mini fortresses now host antiaircraft guns and other weaponry, according to recent analysis.

Although a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman declined to answer a journalist's question about possible responses to American naval incursions into the vital trade corridor, China’s notoriously strident state media pulled no punches.

“Tillerson's statements regarding the islands in the South China Sea are far from professional,” the Chinese Communist Party–linked Global Times declared in an editorial on Friday. “If Trump's diplomatic team shapes future Sino-U.S. ties as it is doing now, the two sides had better prepare for a military clash.”

The state-backed China Daily described Tillerson’s remarks as “a mishmash of naivety, shortsightedness, worn-out prejudices, and unrealistic political fantasies. Should he act on them in the real world, it would be disastrous [and] set a course for devastating confrontation between China and the U.S.”

Although Donald Trump has been fiercely critical of China during his campaign, his attacks have typically focused on alleged unfair trade practices that the U.S. President-elect claims have “stolen” American jobs. The Trump Administration’s trade team has been stocked with outspoken China trade hawks, such as Peter Navarro and Robert Lighthizer.

Given that Trump campaigned on drawing down expensive military commitments overseas, many believed any confrontation between the U.S. and China would be limited to commerce, and that the South China Sea would be less of a hot spot than it has been under the Obama Administration, which stepped up naval patrols in the region.

However, Zhu Feng, professor of international relations at Nanjing University, says the South China Sea will now remain an ""essential component"" of Washington's Asia-Pacific security strategy. “The entire U.S.-China relationship is a minefield,"" he tells TIME. ""There’s not one place to stick your foot.”"

57,http://yournewswire.com/scientific-study-towers-collapsed-due-to-controlled-demolition/,newsbbc,Scientific Study: Towers Collapsed Due To Controlled Demolition,"['Kathy Houseman', 'Max G Force', 'Jerry Hamilton', 'Heyzeus Belden']","A European scientific study has concluded that on September 11, 2001, the Twin Towers were brought down by a controlled demolition.

The study, conducted by four physicists and published in Europhysics Magazine, says that “the evidence points overwhelmingly to the conclusion that all three buildings were destroyed by controlled demolition.”

Wnd.com reports:

“Given the far-reaching implications, it is morally imperative that this hypothesis be the subject of a truly scientific and impartial investigation by responsible authorities,” the four physicists conclude.

The study is the work of Steven Jones, former full professor of physics at Brigham Young University, Robert Korol, a professor emeritus of civil engineering at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, Anthony Szamboti, a mechanical design engineer with over 25 years of structural design experience in the aerospace and communications industries, and Ted Walter, the director of strategy and development for Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth, a nonprofit organization that today represents more than 2,500 architects and engineers.

Conscious of the controversial nature of the report Europhysics included an editor’s note with the study in the September 2016 issue: “This feature is somewhat different from our usual purely scientific articles, in that it contains some speculation. However, given the timing and the importance of the issue, we consider that this feature is sufficiently technical and interesting to merit publication for our readers. Obviously, the content of this article is the responsibility of the authors.”

In August 2002, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology launched what would become a six-year investigation of the three building failures that occurred on 9/11. It found both the Twin Towers, as well as the 47-story World Trade Center Building 7, which was not struck by an airplane, all collapsed as a result of fires and intense heat. But even the NIST found that the three buildings were “the only known cases of total structural collapse in high-rise buildings where fires played a significant role.”

“It bears repeating that fires have never caused the total collapse of a steel-framed high-rise before or since 9/11,” the researchers write. “Did we witness an unprecedented event three separate times on September 11, 2001?”

The report also concluded: “Given the far-reaching implications, it is morally imperative that this hypothesis be the subject of a truly scientific and impartial investigation by responsible authorities.”

The researchers also found “the only phenomenon capable of collapsing such buildings completely has been by way of a procedure known as controlled demolition, whereby explosives or other devices are used to bring down a structure intentionally.”

They noted that “15 years after the event a growing number of architects, engineers, and scientists are unconvinced by that explanation.”

Here are some of the observations the researchers offered:

Fires typically are not hot enough and do not last long enough in any single area to generate enough energy to heat the large structural members to the point where they fail (the temperature at which structural steel loses enough strength to fail is dependent on the factor of safety used in the design. In the case of WTC 7, for example, the factor of safety was generally 3 or higher. Here, 67 percent of the strength would need to be lost for failure to ensue, which would require the steel to be heated to about 660°C);

Most high-rises have fire suppression systems (water sprinklers), which further prevent a fire from releasing sufficient energy to heat the steel to a critical failure state;

Structural members are protected by fireproofing materials, which are designed to prevent them from reaching failure temperatures within specified time periods;

Steel-framed high-rises are designed to be highly redundant structural systems. Thus, if a localized failure occurs, it does not result in a disproportionate collapse of the entire structure. Throughout history, three steel-framed high-rises are known to have suffered partial collapses due to fires; none of those led to a total collapse. Countless other steel-framed high-rises have experienced large, long-lasting fires without suffering either partial or total collapse. In addition to resisting ever-present gravity loads and occasional fires, high-rises must be designed to resist loads generated during other extreme events – in particular, high winds and earthquakes.

The physicists also note the Towers were specifically designed to withstand the impact and destructive force of airliners crashes.

They write:” The total collapse of WTC 7 at 5:20 pm on 9/11, is remarkable because it exemplified all the signature features of an implosion: The building dropped in absolute free fall for the first 2.25 seconds of its descent over a distance of 32 meters or eight stories. Its transition from stasis to free fall was sudden, occurring in approximately one-half second. It fell symmetrically straight down. Its steel frame was almost entirely dismembered and deposited mostly inside the building’s footprint, while most of its concrete was pulverized into tiny particles. Finally, the collapse was rapid, occurring in less than seven seconds. Given the nature of the collapse, any investigation adhering to the scientific method should have seriously considered the controlled demolition hypothesis, if not started with it. Instead, NIST (as well as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which conducted a preliminary study prior to the NIST investigation) began with the predetermined conclusion that the collapse was caused by fires.”

The original investigations did note: “The specifics of the fires in WTC 7 and how they caused the building to collapse remain unknown at this time. Although the total diesel fuel on the premises contained massive potential energy, the best hypothesis has only a low probability of occurrence.”

On March 2006, the NIST’s lead investigator, Dr. Shyam Sunder, was quoted as saying, “Truthfully, I don’t really know. We’ve had trouble getting a handle on building No. 7.”

“The collapse mechanics discussed above are only a fraction of the available evidence indicating that the airplane impacts and ensuing fires did not cause the collapse of the Twin Towers,” the report says. “Videos show that the upper section of each tower disintegrated within the first four seconds of collapse. After that point, not a single video shows the upper sections that purportedly descended all the way to the ground before being crushed. Videos and photographs also show numerous high-velocity bursts of debris being ejected from point-like sources. NIST refers to these as “puffs of smoke” but fails to properly analyze them. NIST also provides no explanation for the midair pulverization of most of the towers’ concrete, the near-total dismemberment of their steel frames, or the ejection of those materials up to 150 meters in all directions.”"

21st Century Wire says…

Finally, a US government official with character has emerged to condemn Washington’s clandestine support of extremist terrorists overseas.

Previously 21WIRE reported how US Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard (HI-D) received a somewhat hostile reception when talking with CNN’s Jake Tapper about her “Stop Funding Terrorism Bill.” Gabbard is the first US legislator since the 1980’s to openly highlight the very real problem of US clandestine services arming and supporting violent internatonal terrorist organizations, particularly those currently operating inside of Syria.

Interestingly, Gabbard’s important move to stop international terrorism comes at the exact same time when the outgoing President Obama has pushed his own executive action to lift all restrictions on US arms exports and support to proxy “rebel” or terrorist fighting groups operating in Syria and elsewhere. In this context, we can see clearly that there is a moral battle being fought in Washington – between those who oppose terrorism – and those like President Obama and Senator John McCain, who have seen it as ‘useful’ in the pursuit of their own geopolitical objectives, particularly by their open support of terrorist factions in Syria.

The following piece of legislation was introduced on in the US Congress on December 8, 2016…



Gabbard House.gov

Washington, DC — Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (HI-02) introduced the Stop Arming Terrorists Act today. The legislation would prohibit the U.S. government from using American taxpayer dollars to provide funding, weapons, training, and intelligence support to groups like the Levant Front, Fursan al Ha and other allies of Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, al-Qaeda and ISIS, or to countries who are providing direct or indirect support to those same groups.

The legislation is cosponsored by Reps. Peter Welch (D-VT-AL), Barbara Lee (D-CA-13), Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA-48), and Thomas Massie (R-KY-04), and supported by the Progressive Democrats of America (PDA) and the U.S. Peace Council.



.

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard said, “Under U.S. law it is illegal for any American to provide money or assistance to al-Qaeda, ISIS or other terrorist groups. If you or I gave money, weapons or support to al-Qaeda or ISIS, we would be thrown in jail. Yet the U.S. government has been violating this law for years, quietly supporting allies and partners of al-Qaeda, ISIL, Jabhat Fateh al Sham and other terrorist groups with money, weapons, and intelligence support, in their fight to overthrow the Syrian government.[i]

“The CIA has also been funneling weapons and money through Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar and others who provide direct and indirect support to groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda. This support has allowed al-Qaeda and their fellow terrorist organizations to establish strongholds throughout Syria, including in Aleppo.

“A recent New York Times article confirmed that ‘rebel groups’ supported by the U.S. ‘have entered into battlefield alliances with the affiliate of al-Qaeda in Syria, formerly known as al Nusra.’ This alliance has rendered the phrase ‘moderate rebels’ meaningless. Reports confirm that ‘every armed anti-Assad organization unit in those provinces [of Idlib and Aleppo] is engaged in a military structure controlled by [al-Qaeda’s] Nusra militants.’

“A recent Wall Street Journal article reported that many rebel groups are ‘doubling down on their alliance’ with al Nusra. Some rebel groups are renewing their alliance, while others, like Nour al-Din al-Zinki, a former CIA-backed group and one of the largest factions in Aleppo are joining for the first time. “The Syria Conquest Front—formerly known as the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front—is deeply intermingled with armed opposition groups of all stripes across Syria’s battlefields.”

“The CIA has long been supporting a group called Fursan al Haqq, providing them with salaries, weapons and support, including surface to air missiles. This group is cooperating with and fighting alongside an al-Qaeda affiliated group trying to overthrow the Syrian government. The Levant Front is another so-called moderate umbrella group of Syrian opposition fighters. Over the past year, the United States has been working with Turkey to give this group intelligence support and other forms of military assistance. This group has joined forces with al-Qaeda’s offshoot group in Syria.

“This madness must end. We must stop arming terrorists. The Government must end this hypocrisy and abide by the same laws that apply to its’ citizens.”

“That is why I’ve introduced the Stop Arming Terrorists bill—legislation based on congressional action during the Iran-Contra affair to stop the CIA’s illegal arming of rebels in Nicaragua. It will prohibit any Federal agency from using taxpayer dollars to provide weapons, cash, intelligence, or any support to al-Qaeda, ISIS and other terrorist groups, and it will prohibit the government from funneling money and weapons through other countries who are directly or indirectly supporting terrorists,” concluded Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.

Stephen Kinzer, a senior fellow at the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University, and award-winning author and journalist said, “The proposal to stop sending weapons to insurgents in Syria is based on the principle that pouring arms into a war zone only intensifies suffering and makes peace more difficult to achieve. Congress made a decision like this about the Nicaraguan contras during the 1980s. Aid to the contras was cut off by the Boland Amendment. The result was a peace process that finally brought an end to wars not only in Nicaragua, but also in El Salvador and Guatemala. This is the example we should be following. Cutting off arms shipments forces belligerents to negotiate. That is what we achieved in Nicaragua. It should be our goal in Syria as well.”

Donna Smith, Executive Director of Progressive Democrats of America said, “Progressive Democrats of America believes that it is fundamentally wrong for the United States to fund those groups or individuals aligned with al-Qaeda, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, ISIS, or other terrorist/extremist organizations. The ‘Stop Arming Terrorists’ bill authored by Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, of Hawaii’s 2nd Congressional District, would help bring an end to the human tragedy unfolding in Syria where the haunting eyes of the innocent children of Aleppo call on us all to stop supporting those who threaten and kill them with ferocious intention. War is war, and terrorism is terrorism whether waged by the state or from external forces. PDA supports this measure.”

Alfred Marder, President of the U.S. Peace Council said, “The U.S. Peace Council is honored to endorse and support the ‘Stop Arming Terrorists Bill’ as a major contribution to peace. This legislation will serve to galvanize the anti-war movement and the opposition to regime change policies that characterize our present foreign policy.”

Background: The Stop Arming Terrorists bill prohibits U.S. government funds from being used to support al-Qaeda, ISIS or other terrorist groups. In the same way that Congress passed the Boland Amendment to prohibit the funding and support to CIA backed-Nicaraguan Contras during the 1980’s, this bill would stop CIA or other Federal government activities in places like Syria by ensuring U.S. funds are not used to support al-Qaeda, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, ISIS, or other terrorist groups working with them. It would also prohibit the Federal government from funding assistance to countries that are directly or indirectly supporting those terrorist groups. The bill achieves this by:"

Update: In the days since this news first broke, the Trump transition team released a statement saying they did not approve the details of the event. However, they did not deny that Trump’s sons serve as directors of the “Opening Day Foundation” nor the authenticity of the original documents mentioned in this article. However, a newly released invitation of the event did not mention any Trump family members as a part of the post-inaugration “opening day” experience

Though many Trump supporters hoped that the soon-to-be President would stand up for the “little guy,” recent developments seem to suggest that Donald Trump and his family are more interested in the lucrative connections and business opportunities they are set to gain through their newfound status as the First Family. A Texas-based non-profit, called the “Opening Day Foundation,” managed by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, is already selling access to Trump for the day after his official inauguration (hence the name “opening day”) via a fundraiser. The fundraiser, set to benefit unnamed “conservation charities,” was marketed as “your opportunity to play a significant role as our family commemorates the inauguration of our father, friend, and President Donald J. Trump,” according to promotional materials obtained by TMZ.

The event offers six sponsorship levels ranging from $25,000 to $1 million. The highest level, titled “The Bald Eagle,” offers a private reception and photo shoot with the newly-minted President, four autographed guitars from Toby Keith and the band Alabama, and a multi-day hunting or fishing trips with Trump’s sons and their confidants. Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump are known for their enthusiasm for long-standing American pastimes of hunting and fishing, though they also have had more than one foray into big game hunting. In a May interview with the New Yorker, Donald Trump Jr alluded to his affinity for the outdoors and his defense of keeping public land in the hands of the people, a controversial issue among outdoorsmen. Though some liberal media outlets have doubted whether the fundraiser will really benefit conservation causes or not, they fail to recognize the possibility that Trump’s sons are not carbon copies of their father.

However, the issue here is not whether or not the fundraiser will actually benefit conservation efforts, but is instead the precedent the fundraiser sets for a “pay to play” set-up in the upcoming Trump administration. The term “pay to play” was largely associated with Democrats during the past election as Hillary Clinton’s shady dealings via the Clinton Foundation showed that her family’s “charity” was little more than a slush fund used to collect money from those who wanted access. Trump criticized the arrangement on more than one occasion on the campaign trail, but it seems that this may be yet another one of his “flip-flops” since winning the electoral contest last month. Considering the enormous wealth of his cabinet picks (nearly $14 billion in combined net worth) and the lofty sums required for personal access to Trump and his kin, it is becoming more and more likely that the next administration will be less about “draining the swamp” and more about expanding the family’s business empire and influence.

It is actually damaging to your health to work too hard and not get enough rest. Yet, many people are doing this on a regular basis. In America, we do everything on the go and at a hurried pace. Slowing down and taking a breather is mandatory!

Just as you need to breathe deeply (literally) from time to time to gain clarity, you also need to sleep to take care of the mind and body. It is how we are designed to recuperate from the activities of the day. Proper rest also is needed for your morning elimination cycle to be healthy.

One way to facilitate good sleep is to sleep in the darkest setting you can tolerate. Light disturbs the rhythm of the pineal gland’s production of serotonin and melatonin. If you need some light at night, it’s a good idea to not have it evenly in your line of sight. And, along with diminishing the quality of your rest, it also can ruin your night vision.

But, the well-scripted performance raised some suspicion with a YouTuber named Spanglevision who decided to dig a little deeper. And, wouldn't you know it, the ""random"" participant was none other than child actor, Brennan Leach, whose father just happens to be Pennsylvania democratic State Senator Daylin Leach. Oh, and in case it wasn't obvious, Daylin supports Hillary for president...shocking.

So, here was the original question from Brennan:

Brennan: ""Hi Madam Secretary. I'm Brennan and I'm 15 years old. At my school, body image is a really big issue for girls my age. I see with my own eyes the damage Donald Trump does when he talks about women and how they look. As the first female president how would you undo some of that damage and help girls understand that they're so much more than just what they look like?""

And here was Hillary's attempt at knocking the soft ball out of the park...it's almost like she knew the question was coming.

Hillary: ""I'm so proud of you for asking that question. You are right -- my opponent has just taken this concern to a new level of difficulty and meanness. And, it's shocking when women are called names and judged solely on the basis of physical attributes. ""My opponent insulted Miss Universe. I mean, how do you get more acclaimed than that? But, it wasn't good enough. So we can't take any of this seriously any more. We need to laugh at it. We need to refute it. We need to ignore it. And we need to stand up to it.""

Here is the full analysis from Spanglevision. Among other things, he points out that Brennan is the only participant of the night who reads her question from a prepared script.

And, of course, as pointed out by Spanglevision, the mainstream media couldn't get enough of the adorable young girl and her ""brave"" question. Here's coverage from the New York Times....

...and CNN...

In fact, pretty much everyone covered the story including The Washington Post, New York Magazine, The Chicago Tribune, Cosmopolitan...it's pretty hard to find a media outlet that didn't cover it actually.

But this isn't young Brennan's first acting gig in the political circus. Turns out her dad, Daylin, utilized her acting skills in the following campaign video when he ran for Congress back in 2014.

And, just in case you would like to see more of her acting work, here is Brennan acting in a movie entitled ""Once Upon A Time Trillium Vein."""

Terminology

The abbreviation, “MB/s”, used below refers to “Mega Bytes per Second”. This should not be confused with the abbreviation “Mb/s” or “Mbps” which refer to “Mega Bits per Second”; these later abbreviations are often used by Internet Service Providers (ISP’s) to express the transfer speeds available on their networks. As a rule of thumb, divide Mb/s by 8 to arrive at an equivalent rate expressed in MB/s.

Overview

This study analyzes the file metadata found in a 7zip archive file, 7dc58-ngp-van.7z, attributed to the Guccifer 2.0 persona. For an in depth analysis of various aspects of the controversy surrounding Guccifer 2.0, refer to Adam Carter’s blog, Guccifer 2.0: Game Over.

Based on the analysis that is detailed below, the following key findings are presented:

On 7/5/2016 at approximately 6:45 PM Eastern time, someone copied the data that eventually appears on the “NGP VAN” 7zip file (the subject of this analysis). This 7zip file was published by a persona named Guccifer 2, two months later on September 13, 2016.

Due to the estimated speed of transfer (23 MB/s) calculated in this study, it is unlikely that this initial data transfer could have been done remotely over the Internet.

The initial copying activity was likely done from a computer system that had direct access to the data. By “direct access” we mean that the individual who was collecting the data either had physical access to the computer where the data was stored, or the data was copied over a local high speed network (LAN).

They may have copied a much larger collection of data than the data present in the NGP VAN 7zip. This larger collection of data may have been as large as 19 GB. In that scenario the NGP VAN 7zip file represents only 1/10th of the total amount of material taken.

This initial copying activity was done on a system where Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) settings were in force. Most likely, the computer used to initially copy the data was located somewhere on the East Coast.

The data was likely initially copied to a computer running Linux, because the file last modified times all reflect the apparent time of the copy and this is a characteristic of the the Linux ‘cp’ command (using default options).

A Linux OS may have been booted from a USB flash drive and the data may have been copied back to the same flash drive, which will likely have been formatted with the Linux (ext4) file system.

On September 1, 2016, two months after copying the initial large collection of (alleged) DNC related content (the so-called NGP/VAN data), a subset was transferred to working directories on a system running Windows. The .rar files included in the final 7zip file were built from those working directories.

The computer system where the working directories were built had Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) settings in force. Most likely, this system was located somewhere on the East Coast.

The .rar files and plain files that eventually end up in the “NGP VAN” 7zip file disclosed by Guccifer 2.0 on 9/13/2016 were likely first copied to a USB flash drive, which served as the source data for the final 7zip file. There is no information to determine when or where the final 7zip file was built.

Analysis

The Guccifer 2 “NGP VAN” files are found in a password protected 7zip file; instructions for downloading this 7zip file can be found at https://pastebin.com/fN9uvUE0.

Technical note: the size of the 7zip file is 711,396,436 bytes and the MD5 sum is: a6ca56d03073ce6377922171fc8b232d.

This .7z file contains several .rar files – one for each top-level directory, as shown below.

The times shown above are in Pacific Daylight Savings Time (PDT). The embedded .rar files are highlighted in yellow. The “*” after each file indicates that the file is password encrypted. This display of the file entries is shown when the .7z file is opened. A password is required to extract the constituent files. This aspect of the .7z file likely motivated zipping the sub-directories (e.g. CNBC and DNC) into .rar files; this effectively hides the structure of the sub-directories, unless the password is provided and the sub-directories are then extracted. The last modification dates indicate that the .rar files were built on 9/1/2016 and all the other files were copied on 7/5/2016. Note that all the times are even (accurate only to the nearest 2 seconds); the significance of this property will be discussed near the end of this analysis. The files copied on 7/5/2016 have last modified times that are closely clustered around 3:50 PM (PDT); the significance of those times will be described below.

The Guccifer 2 “NGP/VAN” file structure is populated by opening the .7z file and then extracting the top-level files inclusive of the .rar files. The .rar files are further unpacked (using WinRAR) into directories with a name derived by dropping the .rar suffix.

Note: although other archive programs claim to handle .rar files, only WinRAR will reliably restore the archived files, inclusive of their sub-microsecond last modification times.

The times recorded in those .rar files are local (relative) times; this determination is detailed in the blog post, RAR Times: Local or UTC? . The times recorded in the .7z file are absolute (UTC) times. If you look at the recorded .rar file times, you will see times like “7/5/2016 6:39:18 PM” and the times in the .7z file will be at some offset to that depending on your time zone. For example, if you are in the Pacific (daylight savings) time zone, the files shown in the .7z file will read 3 hours earlier than those shown in the .rar files, as shown below.

In this case, we need to adjust the .7z file times to reflect Eastern Time. Something like this command if you are on the West Coast (using Cygwin) will make the adjustment.

find . -exec touch -m -r {} -d '+3 hour' {} \;

The .rar files can be unpacked normally because they will appear with the same times as shown in the archive.

Conclusion 1: The DNC files were first copied to a system which had Eastern Time settings in effect; therefore, this system was likely located on the East Coast. This conclusion is supported by the observation that the .7z file times, after adjustment to East Coast time fall into the range of the file times recorded in the .rar files.

Next, we generate (for example, using a Cygwin bash prompt) a tab-separated list of files sorted by last modified date.



echo -e 'Top\tPath\tFile\tLast Mod\tSize' > ../guc2-files.txt # Truncate the 10 fractional digits in last mod time to 3. # Excel won't print more than 3 fractional digits anyway. find * -type f -printf '%h\t%f\t%TF %TT\t%s

' | \ sort -t$'\t' -k3 -k1 -k2 | \ perl -F'/\t/' -lane '$F[2] =~ s/(?<=\.\d{3})\d+$//; ($top=$F[0])=~s{/.*}{}; print join (""\t"", $top, @F);' \ >> ../guc2-files.txt



This file is then imported into an Excel spreadsheet for analysis.

Many archive file formats (e.g., zip and 7zip) record file times only to whole second resolution. The .rar format however records file times to a higher (nanosecond) resolution. This can be difficult to confirm; the GUI interface will only display whole seconds. The included command line utility, rar, however can be used to display the sub-second resolution. The lt (“list technical”) command will provide further detail. For example, the following command will list additional detail on the file 48HourNotice-20081019-174240.fec in the FEC.rar archive.

""c:\Program Files\WinRAR\rar"" lt FEC.rar FEC\48HourNotice-20081019-174240.fec

Conclusion 2: The DNC files were first copied to a file system that was formatted either as an NTFS file system (typically used on Windows systems) or to a Linux (ext4) file system. This conclusion is supported by the observation that the .rar file(s) show file last modified times (mtime) with 7 significant decimal digits (0.1 microsecond resolution) ; this is a characteristic of NTFS file systems.

It is possible that the DNC files were initially copied to a system running Linux and then later copied to a Windows system. Modern Linux implementations use the ext4 file system by default; ext4 records file times in nanoseconds. Thus, if the files were initially copied to a Linux ext4 file system and subsequently copied to a Windows NTFS file system the file times would have been preserved with the 0.1 microsecond precision shown above.

We observe that the last modified times are clustered together in a 14 minute time period on 2016-07-05. If the DNC files were copied in the usual way to a computer running a Windows operating system (e.g., using drag-and-drop in the File Explorer) the last modified times would typically not change (from the original) — the create time would change instead (to the time of the copy). The Windows File Explorer will typically only show the last modified time (by default). A file copy operation using the ‘cp’ command line utility commonly found on a UNIX system (e.g., Linux and Mac OS X) however will (by default) change the last modified time to the time that the copied file was written.

Conclusion 3: The DNC files may have been copied using the ‘cp‘ command (which is available on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X in some form). This (tentative) conclusion is supported by the observation that all of the file last modified times were changed to the apparent time of the copy operation. Other scenarios may produce this pattern of last modified times, but none were immediately apparent to this author at the time that this article was published.

The combination of an NTFS file system and the use of the UNIX ‘cp’ command is sufficiently unusual to encourage a further search for a more plausible scenario/explanation. One scenario that fits the facts would be that the DNC files were initially copied to a system running Linux (e.g., Ubuntu). The system might have had Linux installed on the system’s hard drive, or Linux may have been booted from a USB flash drive; bootable flash drive images with Linux installed on them are widely available.

A review of the DNC file metadata leads to the observation that significant “time gaps” appear between various top-level directories and files. In the spreadsheet, we first mark (with x’s) places where the top-level directory name changes or the top-level directory is the root (“.”) directory. We further calculate the “time gap” which is the difference between the last mod. time of a current entry and its previous entry; from this we subtract an approximation of the transfer time (using our knowledge of average transfer speed) to go from the last mod time to a likely time that the transfer started. We use a cut off of at least 3 seconds to filter out anomalies due to normal network/OS variations. Here are the entries with significant time gaps.

Conclusion 4: The overall time to obtain the DNC files found in the 7z file was 14 minutes; a significant part of that time (13 minutes) is allocated to time gaps that appear between several of the top-level files and directories.

Note that significant time gaps always occur at top-level directory changes (only x’s in the “Top-Level Changed” column). To put the time gaps in better perspective, here is a listing of all top-level changes. A top-level change is defined as either a change in the top-level directory name, or when the parent directory of a file is the root (“.”) directory.

In the “Last Mod” ordered list above, top-level directories and files are intermixed, and they are not in alphabetic order. This pattern can be explained by the use of the UNIX cp command. The cp command copies files in “directory order”, which on many systems is unsorted and will appear to be somewhat random.

The time gaps that appear in the chronologically ordered listing above could indicate that these files and directories were chosen from a much larger collection of copied files; this larger collection of files may have first been copied en masse via the ‘cp -r’ command.

Initially when this data was analyzed, the “time gaps” were attributed to “think time”, where it was assumed that the individual who collected the files would copy the files in small batches and in between each batch would need some “think time” to find or decide on the next batch to copy. This may be an equally valid way to explain the presence of time gaps at various junctures in the top-level files and folders. However, in this analysis we will assume that a much larger collection of files were initially copied on 7/5/2016; the files in the final .7z file (the subject of this analysis) represent only a small percentage of all the files that were initially collected.

We can estimate the transfer speed of the copy by dividing the total number of bytes transferred by the transfer time. The transfer time is approximated by subtracting the time gap total from the total elapsed time of the copy session. This calculation is shown below.

Conclusion 5: The lengthy time gaps suggest that many additional files were initially copied en masse and that only a small subset of that collection was selected for inclusion into the final 7zip archive file (that was subsequently published by Guccifer 2).

Given the calculations above, if 1.98 GB were copied at a rate of 22.6 MB/s and all the time gaps were attributed to additional file copying then approximately 19.3 GB in total were initially copied. In this hypothetical scenario, the 7zip archive represents only about 10% of the total amount of data that was initially collected.

Conclusion 6: The initial DNC file collection activity began at approximately 2016-07-05 18:39:02 EDT and ended at 2016-07-05 18:53:17 EDT. This conclusion is supported by the observed last modified times and the earlier conclusion that the ex-filtrated files were copied to a computer located in the Eastern Time zone.

Conclusion 7. A transfer rate of 23 MB/s is estimated for this initial file collection operation. This transfer rate can be achieved when files are copied over a LAN, but this rate is too fast to support the hypothesis that the DNC data was initially copied over the Internet (esp. to Romania). This transfer rate can also be achieved when copying directly from a computer’s hard drive to a fairly slow USB flash drive; there is a lot variability in USB flash drive speeds. To get a sense of where 23MB/s (23 Mega Bytes per Second) falls in the range of supported speeds for various network and media storage technologies, consult the blog entry titled MB: Mega Bytes or Mega Bits?. We can shorten this statement and say that the 23 MB/s transfer rate supports the conclusion that the files were initially copied locally and not over the Internet.

We turn our attention to the .rar files embedded in the .7z file. Here is an illustrative example (FEC.rar).

From this listing of FEC.rar above, we make the following observations:

The directories were last modified on 9/1/2016 at approximately 12:50 PM.

The file entries are shown with last modified times on

7/5/2016 at approximately 6:45 PM.

7/5/2016 at approximately 6:45 PM. We note that the last modification date for FEC.rar is 12:56:56 PM, EDT on 9/1/2016 after adjusting this time stamp to the Eastern Time zone.

As mentioned earlier, the seconds part of the file and directory last modified times are recorded in the .rar file with a 0.1 microsecond resolution, which is typical of an NTFS file system.

The file last modified times maintain the 7/15/2016 date – they were not changed to dates and times on 9/1/2016 when the sub-directories were created.

last modified times maintain the 7/15/2016 date – they were not changed to dates and times on 9/1/2016 when the sub-directories were created. When WinRAR restored the .rar files it preserved the directory last modification times recorded in the .rar file.

Recall that the NGP/VAN 7zip file has several .rar files which unpack into top-level directories. We can correlate the last modified times of the .rar files with the last modified times of the directories saved in the .rar files as shown below.

Conclusion 8: The .rar files that ultimately are included in the NGP/VAN 7zip file were built on a computer system where the Eastern Daylight Savings Time (EDT) time zone setting was in force. This conclusion is supported by the observation that if the .rar last modified times are adjusted to EDT they fall into the same range as the last modified times for the directories archived in the .rar files.

In the following table, we combine the last modified times of the directories restored from the .rar files with the last modified times of the .rar files themselves and sort by last modified time. The .rar file last modified times shown have been adjusted so that they reflect Eastern Daylight Savings Time (EDT).

From this data, we make the following observations.

On 9/1/2016, some of the directories that were initially collected on 7/5/2016 were copied to working directories. The working directories were zipped into .rar files that were added to the 7zip file that is the subject of this analysis.

The working directories likely reside on an NTFS-formatted file system (they have last modified times with 0.1 microsecond resolution – typical of NTFS). The NTFS file system is commonly used in modern Windows operating system installations.

The DNC directory was the first directory copied to its working directory.

Shortly after that, “DNC.rar” was created.

A series of directories (“DonorAnalysis” through “FEC”) were copied to their working directories.

Shortly after that, the .rar files were created from those working directories.

Approximately 7 minutes later, two more directories were copied to their working directories: “Reports for Kaine” and “Security“.

Finally, almost 3 hours after that, the .rar files were created from those two working directories

We notice no obvious pattern in the order of choosing the directories to copy to their working copies nor in the creation of .rar files.

The varying order of copying directories to their working copies and the observation that they may have been copied in at least three separate batches adds support to the theory that these directories were selected from a larger collection of files and directories that was initially collected on 7/5/2016.

Given the lack of uniformity in the metadata, we decided not to try to estimate the transfer times for the copy operations which copied the source directories to their working copies.

A question that comes up at this point is: Why were the directories first copied to a working directory before zipping them into .rar files? Two alternative explanations are offered:

The larger collection of files that were copied on 7/5/2016 reside on a computer running the Linux operating system. They need to be copied to a Windows operating system if programs like WinRAR (which runs only on Windows) are going to be used. In this case they may have been exported from the Linux system via a Samba network share.

Or, the larger collection of files that were copied on 7/5/2016 is some distance away from the system where the .rar files will be built; they need to be copied over the Internet. It makes sense to transfer only the directories that have been selected for inclusion into the 7zip file, because copying the entire collection over the Internet may be relatively slow.

Neither of the alternatives above suggest that making local working copies was truly necessary, because if we hypothesize that the original collection was exported via a network share, it would seem that this share could have been used directly. That may not have occurred to the person building the .rar files, or perhaps they had some other motivation to make local copies. One idea might be that the local working copies were made to facilitate some internal pruning, but we so no evidence of that — the time gaps occur only at the top level (as discussed earlier).

Conclusion 9: The final copy (on 9/1/2016) from the initial file collection to working directories was likely done with a conventional drag-and-drop style of copy. This conclusion is based on the observation that the file last modified times were preserved when copying from the initial collection to the working copies, unlike the first copy operation on 7/5/2016 (which is attributed to the use of the cp command).

Conclusion 10: The final working directories were likely created on an NTFS file system present on a computer running Windows. This conclusion is based on the following observations: (1) the file timestamps have 0.1 micro-second resolution (a characteristic of NTFS file systems), (2) NTFS file systems are widely used on Windows systems, (3) NTFS file systems are typically not used on USB flash drives, and (4) WinRAR is a Windows based program and was likely used to build the .rar files.

At the beginning of this analysis, we noted that the seconds part of the file last modified times that appear at the top-level in the .7z file were all even (a multiple of 2). Windows FAT formatted volumes are constrained to represent times only to the nearest two (2) seconds. USB flash drives are typically formatted FAT or FAT32.

Conclusion 11: The .rar files and plain files that were combined into the final .7z file (the subject of this analysis) were likely copied to a FAT-formatted flash drive first. This conclusion is supported by the observation that the seconds part of all the last modified times are all exact multiples of 2."

Julian Assange says his internet link was 'severed' by the country granting him asylum just hours after claims he was poisoned by a Pret vegan sandwich brought to him by Pamela Anderson.

The WikiLeaks founder's only connection to the outside world from his Ecuadorian embassy hideout in London was cut today, with supporters saying America was behind the cyber attack.

But the organisation has since confirmed it was actually Ecuador who cut off his internet access shortly after Saturday night's publication of what appeared to be speeches Hilary Clinton was paid to deliver to financial giant Goldman Sachs.

Wikileaks tweeted this evening: 'We can confirm Ecuador cut off Assange's internet access Saturday, 5pm GMT, shortly after publication of Clinton's Goldman Sachs speechs.'

But Wikileaks revealed this morning that Assange's internet link had been 'intentionally severed by a state party'

It is not clear why Ecuador severed the connection but a source at the Ecuadorian Ministry in Ecuador previously said it would not respond to Twitter speculation but reiterated its commitment to Assange.

The source said: 'We don't respond to speculation circulating on Twitter.

'Ecuador will continue to protect Julian Assange and uphold the political asylum granted to him in 2012.'

The controversial anti-secrecy website has been busy aggravating Washington - in particular the Clinton family - this month by methodically releasing damaging information about the prospective First Family from the hacked emails of Hillary's campaign’s chairman John Podesta.

The Clinton campaign has called the hacking akin to a modern Watergate and has blamed the Russians for trying to influence the presidential elections, which WikiLeaks denies.

It came as bizarre rumors spread that Mr Assange may have died over the weekend after a visit from Pamela Anderson, 49.

On Saturday the former Baywatch star walked into the Ecuadorian embassy in London clutching bags from Pret A Manger, the popular UK sandwich shop.

HOW SUN-STARVED ASSANGE'S HEALTH HAS SUFFERED IN EMBASSY The hacker has endured a self-imposed imprisonment in a single room after being given diplomatic asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London’s Knightsbridge. The embassy — strewn with red, yellow and blue Ecuadorian flags — takes up a single floor of an imposing block behind Harrods. Initially, Assange slept on an inflatable mattress donated by embassy staff, who are described as having become ‘like family’ to him. But when it became clear his stay was not going to be temporary, a small room was transformed into his living quarters and a bed installed. He is thought to have stood in direct sunlight for only about 20 minutes during his incarceration, when he emerged on the balcony to address his supporters in August 2012. He has a specially adapted lamp to mimic sunlight in his room — which measures just 15ft by 13ft. Near a Victorian fireplace he has a treadmill donated by the Left-wing film-maker Ken Loach and in his first year at the embassy he notched up 744 miles on the running machine. Sources have said his health has suffered ever since he walked in four years ago, and there is a suspicion Assange, still unapologetic about his role in leaking government secrets, had pushed to leave because of illness.

She said afterwards she was worried for his health and when a series of mysterious tweets were sent by WikiLeaks on Sunday his fans feared that he had perished after eating her food.

Assange, 45, who has been hiding in the London embassy since 2012 to avoid sex crime allegations in Sweden, is alive and well according to the embassy and now appears to be the victim of a cyber attack.

At 6.30am this morning WikiLeaks tweeted: 'Julian Assange's internet link has been intentionally severed by a state party', with conspiracy theorists claiming that it is linked to John Kerry's visit to London to meet Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.

WikiLeaks say they 'have activated the appropriate contingency plans' as they try to restore his internet link.

It all began when Anderson paid Assange a visit on Saturday at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he has been hiding out for more than four years to avoid a rape investigation in his native Sweden.

In her hands were two bags from Pret, a popular sandwich shop chain based in the UK.

Anderson, an advocate for animals' rights, later said that she brought Assange 'a nice vegan lunch'.

'He said I tortured him with bringing him vegan food,' she then joked.

The former Playboy model said the WikiLeaks founder was doing 'really well' but expressed concern for him and his family.

The Australian has been living in the embassy for over four years and has been granted political asylum by Ecuador.

He is due to be questioned over a sex allegation in Sweden - which he denies. Mr Assange believes that if he goes to Sweden he will be extradited to the United States for questioning over the activities of WikiLeaks.

The ex-Baywatch star told the Press Association: 'I really believe in him and think he's a good person, and I'm concerned about his health, his family, and I just hope that by some miracle he's set free.'

Twitter was alight with the conspiracy theory on Sunday night after these three tweets that appeared to be coded were posted on the WikiLeaks account and branded a 'dead man's switch'

Twitter was alight with the conspiracy theory on Sunday night after a series of tweets that appeared to be coded were posted on the official WikiLeaks account.

The three tweets were headlined 'pre-commitment 1: John Kerry', 'pre-commitment 2: Ecuador' and 'pre-commitment 3: UK FCO', the latter appearing to refer to the United Kingdom's Foreign & Commonwealth Office.

Each tweet was then followed by a series of numbers and letters, causing many on the social media site to believe they were a 'dead man's switch' meant to be activated if Assange is killed.

The conspiracy theories were also fueled by the fact that WikiLeaks dumped more than 1,000 emails leaked from the account of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, to the public on Saturday.

But Twitter users weren't only speculating on whether Assange was alive or dead - they believed they knew who his alleged killer was as well: A certain Baywatch blonde bombshell.

But many on Twitter took Anderson's words seriously - and they weren't laughing.

'Don't trust unconfirmed reports of Assange being alive. The Clinton machine is capable of body doubles,' wrote one user.

'ARREST PAMELA ANDERSON NOW', they added.

'GET ASSANGE OUT OF THERE AND INTO HIDING,' a user named Rosa Marzullo frantically tweeted to citizen journalist James Albury.

'How do we know that Pamela Anderson isn't working 4 (sic) someone to set him up?'

Roosh V, the controversial blogger who has called for the legalization of rape, tweeted out an article about Anderson bringing Assange lunch.

'If he's dead, I'd have that food tested,' he added.

Each tweet was then followed by a series of numbers and letters, causing many on the social media site to believe they were a 'dead man's switch' meant to be activated in case he is killed

But fashion designer Vivienne Westwood revealed on Sunday that Anderson had met with Assange to discuss a new trust she wants to set up.

'I was supposed to take Pamela Anderson to see Julian in the embassy but she got the date wrong, so she went on her own the day after me,' Westwood told the Mail On Sunday.

'She told me afterwards that they got on very well. Julian was just brilliant.'

'Pamela's trying to help people with her new trust and he gave her some ideas on how to do that.'"

69,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-china-idUSKBN15504D,newsbbc,"Chinese state media hopes for best with Trump, prepares for worst",['Reuters Editorial'],"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese state media on Saturday said that it hoped the new U.S. administration of President Donald Trump understood the importance of relations with China, but that Beijing should also prepare for the worst.

On the campaign trail, Trump railed against China, accusing it of stealing American jobs, and also angered Beijing by taking a call from the president of self-ruled Taiwan, which China views as a wayward province with no right to formal foreign ties.

While Trump made no direct mention of China in his inaugural address, he struck a defiant tone, saying American workers have been devastated by the outsourcing of jobs abroad.

In a front page commentary, the overseas edition of the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily said the two countries should not try to force each other into submission, but look for win-win cooperation and manage their disputes.

""The new U.S. government should realize that it's normal for these two great countries to have problems and disagreements. What is crucial is to control and manage disputes and find a way to resolve them,"" it said.

""China hopes the inauguration of the new U.S. president can be a new starting point for the development of China-U.S. ties,"" the paper said.

""The stable and healthy development of relations accords with the interests of both peoples, and is the common expectation of the international community.""

Sister paper the Global Times, an influential publication which often strikes a stridently nationalistic tone, noted that while Trump has said a lot about China, his actual policy has yet to take shape.

""Definitely, the Trump administration wants to boost exports to China and relocate factories from China back to the US. Taiwan will be merely a bargaining chip for them to put trade pressure on China,"" it said in an editorial.

The paper said Trump's China policy will hinge on how well he understands the overlapping interests of the world's two largest economies and whether he will be motivated enough to change the existing structure with force.

""Undoubtedly, the Trump administration will be igniting many 'fires' on its front door and around the world. Let's wait and see when it will be China's turn."""

74,http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/the-top-5-harmful-toxins-in-air/?a_aid=54e3fadc2316d,newsbbc,The Top 5 Harmful Toxins in Air,"['Kathrine Hansen', 'Ha Phan']","A major part of how healthy we are comes from how clean the air we breathe really is. Fumes and carcinogens from factories and automobile exhaust, and tons of other harmful gases are all around us. These are dangerous molecules to inhale, and they also decrease the actual amount of oxygen in the air. Now, consider this: most of our airborne toxins are inhaled while we’re inside because we spend most of our lives indoors whether it’s in offices, homes, schools, churches.

And since that’s where most of our time is spent – at home, in stores, restaurants and more, it’s important to be aware of what’s in that air you breathe most often: smoke, pet dander, paint fumes, mold, mildew and possibly billions of microorganisms.

Oxygen is the major component that the body uses to neutralize toxins and remove them from the body. The air we breathe is low in oxygen content when it is polluted with carcinogens; toxic factory and auto exhaust fumes, and many other things. We are suffocating. “Dirty” air presents less than adequate oxygen levels for your body to perform its tasks optimally. That means less oxygen and more toxins to the bloodstream, and the colon, which is responsible for eliminating toxins from your body.

There is very little chance that you or a group of you will make any significant changes in the way that factories burn off waste, or change the way that car manufacturers design their exhaust systems in a significantly short amount of time. Because most of your toxic molecules are inhaled while inside anyway, we are going to focus the top 5 toxins from indoor air.

1. Tobacco Smoke

Almost no one argues against the fact that cigarettes are bad. Not anymore, anyway. And unfortunately for us all, we now know that quitting doesn’t save us all. We know that there is danger in smoking. We are now attending to the secondhand smoke dangers as well. Secondhand smoke is a real problem that requires uncomfortable ways of living in order to compensate for it.

For many years smoking has been linked to lung cancer. It’s also been linked to colorectal cancer. Polyps become enlarged and irritated with secondhand smoke inhalation. The larger the polyp, the greater is the risk of it metastasizing into cancer. People are paying attention to the dangers of secondhand smoke. This awareness is the reason that you now experience ‘SMOKE FREE’ restaurants and workplaces and homes. When you inhale cigarette smoke, you are breathing in tar and other additives which are difficult to expel from your body. In the human body they can cause cancer, in children, there is the added danger of causing damage to their still-developing organs.

2. Paint Fumes

The dangers of lead and mercury added to paints have been assessed and addressed by eliminating them from paint formulas. Some paints on the market give off fumes called Volatile Organic Compounds which is unsafe for inhaling. Even with a high vapor pressure causing it to dissipate quickly, there are times when it is inhaled. Over time, the buildup of these VOC’s causes toxins to build up in the body which can lead to headaches, loss of coordination, liver damage and other disorders. You should know that there is a danger to breathing in these fumes even outdoors. However, the greater threat is indoors, which is why many paints come with the warning that you should use them only in well ventilated areas.

An even better solution is to buy paints that do not contain these compounds. Know too that the fumes don’t come only from some paints. The EPA has a long list of common products that emit these harmful fumes, such as, minerals, varnishes, enamels, lacquers, stains, latex, and water colors. It really would be an impossible task to eliminate the threat from all products that contain these volatile compounds. For that reason you should make the effort to reduce them in your home by using VOC-Free Paints.

3. Micro-Organisms

According to the EPA, biological contaminants are “living organisms or their derivatives,” and they include mold, mildew, bacteria, dust mites, animal dander and viruses. These organisms build up in the body to toxic levels and they can cause respiratory problems among other things. Children, elderly and people with weakened immune systems are especially susceptible to airborne biological contaminants.

4. Pet Dander

Pet dander is dead animal skin cells, reminiscent of human dandruff, which sloughs off naturally as the animal’s skin becomes dry. These skin cells are found in concentrated amounts around the animal’s sleeping area. Once airborne these particles can be inhaled or swallowed. It’s estimated that 30% of allergy sufferers are pet owners. So they definitely need to reduce the airborne particles from their pets.

5. Mold & Mildew

Mold is naturally occurring outdoors. It’s only natural that some of the spores will get into your home just as a matter of moving in and out. When they enter and begin to multiply then there is the danger of inhaling dangerous quantities. The threats from the spores of mold and mildew can include: respiratory ailments, headaches, nausea and diarrhea. Mold found in damp areas like bathrooms are generally referred to as mildew. These spores are unclean and unsightly. When you go in and scrub them away, you are actually making them airborne and that’s when there’s a chance that you will inhale them.

I highly recommend cleansing the air in your home with the REME+ advanced air purification unit. I also suggest regular lung cleansing with a product such as Allertrex®.

75,http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-attacks-clinton-for-foundation-pay-to-play-allegations-2016-10,newsbbc,Trump: The Clintons 'were willing to play fast and loose' with their Foundation,['Lisa Lerer'],"WASHINGTON (AP) — Seeking to lash Hillary Clinton to her husband's sprawling post-presidential empire, Donald Trump accused the couple of turning to corruption to enrich themselves while in public service.

On Thursday, the GOP nominee cited newly released emails from her campaign chairman's personal account showing Doug Band, a former Bill Clinton aide, describing overlapping relationships between the Clinton Foundation and the family's private gains.

""Mr. Band called the arrangement 'unorthodox.' The rest of us call it outright corrupt,"" said Trump at the first of three campaign rallies in Ohio. ""If the Clintons were willing to play this fast and loose with their enterprise when they weren't in the White House, just imagine what they'll do in the Oval Office.""

Band wrote the 2011 memo to defend his firm, Teneo, describing how he encouraged his clients to contribute to the foundation and get consulting and speaking gigs for Bill Clinton. Some of his work included obtaining ""in-kind services for the president and his family — for personal travel, hospitality, vacation and the like.""

The message was released by WikiLeaks after a hack by others of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's private email account.

""I think we've had enough of the Clintons, in all fairness,"" Trump said. ""Don't you think?""

Band called the business, ""Bill Clinton Inc."" — a term Trump referenced to paint the family as using their public profiles for personal gain, a line of attack Republicans have long tried.

The hacked emails, as well as recent news of an ""Obamacare"" premium hike, have appeared to hand Trump a pair of potent gifts in the campaign's final fortnight. But to the frustration of many in his party, Trump has struggled to stay on message, often turning to personal attacks against private citizens who he feels have wronged him, like the Gold Star family of a deceased Muslim-American solider.

Any newfound focus is coming late: Opinion polls indicate Clinton has a significant advantage in the race.

Her campaign is so comfortable with her position that she's begun expanding the scope of her campaign to help down-ballot Democrats — her party sees an opportunity to win control of the Senate and reduce its deficit in the House — and retool her campaign message to emphasize unifying the country after a divisive race.

A new Associated Press-GfK poll released Wednesday found Clinton on the cusp of a potentially commanding victory, fueled by solid Democratic turnout in early voting, massive operational advantages and increasing enthusiasm among her supporters.

The survey shows her leading Trump nationally by a staggering 14 percentage points among likely voters, 51-37. That margin is the largest national lead for Clinton among recent surveys. But other polls generally have shown her ahead of Trump for the past several weeks.

Clinton was unveiling a new policy plan aimed at reducing bullying at a campaign stop with Michelle Obama Thursday in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, marking the first joint appearance for the two first ladies on the campaign trail. Mrs. Obama's appearances have become a key part of Clinton's effort to fire up women, particularly black women for whom she's a model and a source of pride.

Clinton's plan would provide $500 million in new funding to states that develop comprehensive anti-bullying efforts. The campaign said states must address spoken and cyber bullying, establish a process for addressing incidents and ban bullying on the ""basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and religion.""

It would be paid for through Clinton's proposed tax increases on the wealthy.

The presidential candidates and dozens of outside groups involved in the race are also due to file their final major fundraising reports before Election Day. These documents will show fundraising and spending between Oct. 1 and Oct. 19_giving a sense of what resources each side had available as the campaign entered its frantic final stretch."

In Addition To Practicing Law', ""Stephen'S Passions Include Education"", 'Officiating Swimming On National']","On April 19th, Microsoft announced its new SQL 2017 server edition. While this product is, of course, not geared exclusively toward lawyers and law firms, there are implications for the legal profession based on what Microsoft says the new version of this product can do.

Microsoft has offered the SQL Server for several years. It is, in essence, a relational database management system. Since it is a database server, it is also a software product that can store and retrieve data requested by other software, which may run either on the same computer or on other computers across a network (including the internet).

Microsoft has provided new and improved data analytic tools that will enable analysis of all sorts of data in all sorts of ways across all sorts of different platforms.

Because of that, SQL can undertake analytics of data of various types. Over the years, Microsoft has developed and marketed at least a dozen different editions aimed at different audiences and workloads, although none of these have been specifically directed toward lawyers or the legal profession.

This year’s edition offered three new significant improvements:

In a growing trend for Microsoft to make its products more available and usable to iOS people, SQL can now be used with Linux-based platforms like iOS. This is good news for Apple users that want to use the product or who interact with hardware on which SQL runs.

SQL 2017 introduces a new and faster migration tool. It has reduced migration to five or six steps, which means you can quickly move large databases from one place to another. Microsoft also introduced elements that improve abilities to move databases to the cloud and back again.

SQL 2017 promises to offer such time-saving tools as face recognition and cognitive services, designed to make the platform easier and faster.

However, it is what Microsoft promises SQL 2017 will now do on the analytics front that’s intriguing, and which may ultimately affect legal tech. Microsoft has provided new and improved data analytic tools that will enable analysis of all sorts of data in all sorts of ways across all sorts of different platforms. This will extend SQL Server’s use in analytics: Microsoft is touting that SQL 2017 will offer artificial intelligence tools and deep and adaptive learning systems to provide even more in-depth and tailored analysis. This will allow the system to do such things as make predictions and calculate probabilities of events based on data. According to Microsoft, SQL 2017 is the first commercial database that has built-in deep learning and artificial intelligence.

Could SQL 2017, with the right data, predict such things as the chances of a jury verdict or court ruling?

The analytics and AI functions in SQL 2017 could enable law firms and in-house departments to make improved decisions and perform better analysis. Industries that use and depend on legal services can make both quantitative and qualitative assessments about such things as the value added by outside counsel. Insurance companies, for example, have for many years collected and tried to use and compare data about the time spent by lawyers to review and analyze legal bills. Whether SQL 2017 might be a better and easier to use tool for these functions remains to be seen. But since this is the year that many firms, in-house departments and legally related businesses are reviewing their Microsoft products and moving to such things as Office365 and Azure, SQL 2017, with its improved AI and deep learning capabilities, may be attractive.

But the really intriguing thing about SQL 2017 is the potential use of the software to analyze data and make predictions in law. Could SQL 2017, with the right data, predict such things as the chances of a jury verdict or court ruling? Could it better examine billing rates and trends and success rates of lawyers? Or perhaps it could help do a deep dive on the proclivities of appellate judges to predict opinions better.

Given the vast amount of businesses and governmental systems using Microsoft in one form or another, including SQL Server, the potential data stream housed on Microsoft servers and available to be analyzed could be huge. And the opportunity for combining data from various sources into a super-database that allows the application of AI and analysis promised by Microsoft could be quite significant to the legal profession.

SQL 2017—if it does what Microsoft says—could open up increased data analytics and AI for lawyers and those who use lawyers.

Microsoft has always been a player in document storage and cloud computing, which indirectly affect the practice of law. Granted, Microsoft has not previously participated directly in the legal space in a significant way. But in the past year, Microsoft has been injecting itself more and more in legal tech, such as committing money to Legal Services Corporation to help build out legal service portals for low-income individuals. So, while not directed toward the legal profession, SQL 2017—if it does what Microsoft says—could open up increased data analytics and AI for lawyers and those who use lawyers.

This alone won’t allow Microsoft to move into the legal space in a big way. To do that, it would likely need to acquire a legal analytics startup or even a more mature company to increase its role. And it would likely need to invest in a team of lawyers and technologists to make it happen. It must also get lawyers to move more data into Azure, its cloud platform, than what it has managed so far. Whether Microsoft wants to make this kind of investment remains to be seen, but the advances in SQL 2017 could be a good start."

Between now and Election Day on Nov. 8, WikiLeaks is expected to release more than 40,000 more emails about Clinton that are meant to damage her run for the White House — possibly in batches on a near-daily basis.

ADVERTISEMENT

The emails, from hacks of the Democratic National Committee and Clinton confidante John Podesta’s email account, may be the best chance Republican presidential nomineehas of knocking off Clinton, the Democratic nominee and heavy favorite to win the White House.

That makes WikiLeaks founder Assange one of 2016’s biggest wild cards.

Assange appears to relish the role.

“He has become which is what I think he always wanted to be: an alternative statesman,” said Daniel Domscheit-Berg, a former spokesperson from the organization’s early days.

“He’s not officially elected, but he’s involved in the highest level of political debate. He can have an influence on the U.S. election. It doesn’t really get much bigger than this.”

Assange has repeatedly vowed to release information expected to be damaging to Clinton, and on Thursday made public the sixth installment of material allegedly stolen from Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chairman.

The WikiLeaks Twitter account, believed to be manned by Assange, vacillates daily between defending the organization against detractors and promoting damaging stories about Clinton — some of which border on conspiracy theory.

It rarely touches on Trump, and Assange in interviews has been cagey about his support of the business mogul. Trump confidante Roger Stone has repeatedly claimed contact with Assange, telling CBS Miami Wednesday that he has “a back channel communication” with Assange via a mutual friend with whom he dined as recently as last week.

U.S. intelligence last week publicly blamed the Russian government for the hack on the DNC and other political organizations, leading many to question whether WikiLeaks is now an agent of Moscow.

“Media needs to stop treating WikiLeaks like it is same as FOIA. Assange is colluding with Russian government to help [GOP nominee Donald Trump],” Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon tweeted Monday, referring to the Freedom of Information Act.

Suspicion that Assange might be acting at the behest of the Russian government gained steam in 2012 when he briefly hosted a talk show on RT, a Kremlin-backed news network.

But Domscheit-Berg and others tracking Assange’s organization say they doubt he is taking orders from Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“I’m leery of attributing Assange as being directly supported [by Russia]. I think it’s fair to say that in furthering his own agenda, he is willing to be a tool of the Russians,” said Nicholas Weaver, a senior researcher at the International Computer Science Institute.

Weaver and others have long warned that WikiLeaks has no compunction about publishing information stolen by foreign intelligence agencies who want to use the group as a bullhorn to damage another government — or another political party.

“For Russia, WikiLeaks is more like a useful idiot because they are too cowardly and dumb to be in on the master plan,” a U.S. official told The Daily Beast — one of several who told the publication that WikiLeaks is merely the beneficiary of stolen documents, not the architect.

Assange has pushed back on accusations that he is colluding with the Russian government, tweeting that “Democrat-aligned journalists threw the facts out the window to make a Russian conspiracy about WikiLeaks & Trump.”

In interviews over the summer, Assange claimed to also have some material on Trump, but “from a point of view of an investigative journalist organization like WikiLeaks,” it was “hard for us to publish much more controversial material than what comes out of Donald Trump’s mouth every second day.”

The Hill reached out to WikiLeaks for this story but did not receive a response.

It’s unclear why Assange has such a grudge against Clinton, though it appears to be rooted in part in the prosecution of former Army Pvt. Chelsea Manning for the leak of hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables during Clinton’s tenure at the State Department.

In a June 12 interview on British TV, the Australian-born Assange argued against a Clinton presidency based on his ""personal perspective.”

He said Clinton is one of the main U.S. officials pushing to punish him for the release of the Manning cables.

At the time, Clinton called the publication “an attack on the international community.”

Manning is currently serving a 35-year prison sentence. Assange has not been charged.

“We do see her as a bit of a problem for freedom of the press more generally,” Assange said.

In February, Assange, who is living in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and is avoiding a rape charge in Sweden he claims is politically motivated, published an editorial on WikiLeaks calling Clinton a “war hawk with bad judgment who gets an unseemly emotional rush out of killing people.”

“She shouldn't be let near a gun shop, let alone an army. And she certainly should not become president of the United States,” he wrote.

Shortly after Clinton, sick with pneumonia, staggered leaving a Sept. 11 memorial event this year, the account tweeted a public poll inviting users to speculate whether she had an allergy problem, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis or head injury complications.

WikiLeaks later deleted the tweet shortly thereafter, saying that “the possibilities are too speculative.”

For some former employees who believed in WikiLeaks’s stated mission of transparency, the attacks on Clinton have been deeply demoralizing.

Domscheit-Berg and others left the organization over concerns that Assange’s autocratic grip over the organization had led him to use it as a platform to promote his own agenda, not root out abuses of power.

WikiLeaks “has no board, no governance, and no effective rules. In such a febrile environment, and with Julian so central to the organisation's ability to function, it's not hard to see how such decisions came to be seen as correct,” wrote former employee James Ball, who defected in 2011.

“He likes using the material he’s publishing, and he’s mixing this with his own personal views,” said Domscheit-Berg."

Former presidential candidate Dr. Ron Paul said that US government “propagandists” push for a foreign policy of “intervening around the world”

After Hillary Clinton blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for personally directing a cyberattack that cost her the 2016 presidential election, Dr. Paul shrugged off the allegations as a “fiasco” in an interview for RT where he discusses “fake news” and more

RT reports:

“I think they’re just agitating, because they lost the election. They’re throwing out accusations and they have no proof,” the former Republican congressman for Texas said.

“The same people who are making all these charges, they didn’t seem to be worried a bit by the secretary of state having a private server,” Paul said, “which made it much easier for Russia or anybody else to know what was going on.”

Paul, a libertarian advocate of a foreign policy of non-intervention, went on to explain that ideally, the US should not have to worry about any other country having an incentive to interfere in US elections. The root of the problem, Paul believes, is in the US government doing the exact thing it now accuses Russia of doing.

“The American people should be worried about the influence of our CIA in other people’s elections, I mean probably hundreds. It’s constant,” he said, even going as far as to allude to “domestic assassinations” the CIA has allegedly taken part in.

Paul then brought his two points together in describing a sort of shadow government in cahoots with the major media, saying that the anti-Russian narrative was being promulgated in order to “amplify the arguments between Republicans and Democrats,” which he discounted as political theater.

“Our government doesn’t change a whole lot,” Paul explained. “The people, who behind the scenes control the government, are always the same. And I consider that to be the case in most governments.”

“The propagandists are on the side of the people who want us to be intervening around the world, and I imagine that because Trump has suggested maybe we ought to do a little bit less of that, maybe they don’t like that idea, and they want to discredit him for that approach,” Paul said.

Moving to the matter of “fake news,” another controversial issue heating up after the November election result, Paul was asked about Facebook unrolling a new policy of fact-checking, potentially pushing down news stories in its News Feed.

“If it’s a private organization,” Paul said, “they have a right to monitor. And they probably will make mistakes, but that is so much different than when a company like Facebook works with the government. That’s where the real danger is.”"
80,http://www.dumblittleman.com/2008/02/kickstart-your-brain-with-the-mozart.html,newsbbc,Kickstart your Brain with the ‘The Mozart Effect’,['Please Enter Your Name Here'],"The Mozart Effect.” The theory, essentially, is that listening to the music of Mozart can improve your intellectual capacity. The question is, can listening to classical music make you more successful?

If music improves cognitive functions, it is reasonable to believe you can reap those same rewards, leading to increased performance and efficiency at work. Increased efficiency means you get things done quicker. Finishing earlier means you have increased free time to put towards another assignment or to spend relaxing.

Music Increases Cognitive Function: Several studies have shown cognitive improvements in those who listened to classical music prior to performing certain tasks or taking tests. Functions that demonstrated in increase in capacity included: Language skills, reading skills, spatial tasks, verbal communications, quantitative abilities, concentration, memory, and motor skills.

Several studies of students preparing to take the SAT test compared test scores of those who listened to classical music prior to taking the test with those who did not. Those who preceded the test with classical music scored higher on the SAT than the students who did not.

A study by the University of Washington showed that copyeditors who listened to classical music for 90 minutes while editing copy found 21% more mistakes than those who did not.

Improved Interpersonal Relations through Music: Listening to music not only improves functions within your brain, but music has also been shown to have a profound effect on mood. The style of music correlated with the mood experienced by the listener.

Those who listened to music that was considered positive or upbeat were asked questions about their impressions of other people, and these individuals generally responded in a positive manner. Likewise, those who listened to music that was considered sad or depressing, and then were asked to form impressions of the same people as the first group, generally responded in a negative manner.

This suggests that listening to music can have a profound effect on the way people view life and on their success in maintaining interpersonal relations. If listening to music that is considered positive or upbeat improves overall mood, it stands to reason that life will be viewed in a more favorable manner, and the listener will experience greater success in his relationships.

Success in work and life can rely largely on our approach to each. With an improved outlook and a happier mood, we can achieve much more than if we proceed with negativity.

Music and Healing: Researchers have studied the effects of music on patients that have had strokes, have epilepsy, or suffer from developmental disabilities. Those who had strokes were able to regain speech and language abilities much faster and more completely when music was incorporated into their recovery. Epileptics – even those in a coma – who were exposed to music showed a reduced incidence of seizures. Autistic children who had difficulty expressing themselves began showing great improvements once music was incorporated into their therapy.

Evidence continues to surface reinforcing music’s positive impact on not only the human brain, but on overall health and well being. In addition to stimulating the mind, classical music can calm and soothe, thereby reducing stress. Stress is one of the biggest causes of illness, so it stands to reason that by reducing the amount of stress your body experiences, the healthier it will be. And the healthier you are, the more likely you are to achieve your goals.

Companies Coordinate Song & Learning: As the benefits of incorporating music into our lives become more and more apparent, many universities, companies, and large corporations have begun including music in their training programs.

The Shell Corporation, DuPont, and IBM, among others, have begun using classical music to compliment corporate training programs. The results have shown participants learn new material in about half the time and demonstrate increased retention.

Improve Your Performance With Music: Music stimulates parts of the mind in ways never thought possible, having far reaching effects on brain function. Whether a temporary improvement caused by an increase in arousal or improvement in mood, or an actual raising of mental ability caused by neuron stimulation deep within the brain, you can incorporate music into your life to help you reach your goals faster and more easily.

Making this one simple change is easy to do, yet can potentially have widespread benefits. Any increase in cognitive ability will help you complete your work more quickly and accurately, providing a positive impact on your career. Increased efficiency will provide you with more free time, which in turn can help you better achieve work life balance. Not to mention the positive change in mood, which gives you a happier outlook on life as a whole. So turn up the Mozart, and see where the music takes you.

Bush paintings and recently claimed to have hacked Hillary Clinton's email server.

In the interest of transparency, and to let readers judge for themselves, we decided to publish the full chat log. We kept the parts in Romanian, adding the English translation, according to Google Translate.

Motherboard: So, first of all, what can you tell me about yourself? Who are you?

Guccifer 2.0: i'm a hacker, manager, philosopher, women lover. I also like Gucci! I bring the light to people. I'm a freedom fighter! So u can choose what u like!

So that was your entry point, what happened next?

I used 0-day exploit of NGP VAN soft then I installed shell-code into the DNC server. it allowed me to intrude into DNC network. They have Windows-based domain architecture. then I installed my Trojans on several PCs. I had to go from one PC to another every week so CrowdStrike couldn't catch me for a long time. I know that they have cool intrusion detection system. But my heuristic algorithms are better.



When did you first hack them?

Last summer.

And when did you get kicked out?

And why did you hack the DNC in the first place?

DNC isn't my first deal.

Who else have you hacked?

As its first step, the LSC’s portal project will create pilot websites in one or two states, with the aim of creating a template that can be replicated elsewhere. Pro Bono Net, a nonprofit that promotes innovative uses of technology to increase access to justice, will also work with Microsoft and LSC. “The current system of accessing legal services is confusing, opaque and inefficient for many people,” said LSC president James Sandman in a statement. “The goal of the portals is to simplify the process by providing a single, statewide point of access to effective help for people needing civil legal assistance.”

While this may seem somewhat attenuated or small in scope, it is important to remember that access to justice only works when people can easily find resources. A patchwork of government services, courts, non-profits, and private corporations can be prohibitively hard to navigate. LSC says that it hopes to have the first programs up and running within two years."

87,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pence-asia-japan-idUSKBN17L066,newsbbc,Pence says working with allies to put pressure on North Korea,['Roberta Rampton'],"TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Wednesday that Washington would work with its allies and China to put economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea but added that America would defeat any attack with an ""overwhelming response"".

Pence arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday from South Korea and reassured Japan of U.S. commitment to reining in North Korea's nuclear and missile ambitions in a series of meetings with Japanese leaders, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

Speaking aboard the USS Ronald Reagan, a Nimitz class aircraft carrier undergoing scheduled maintenance at its home port of Yokosuka, Pence said U.S. intentions remained unwavering in the face of the threat posed by the reclusive North, which has conducted a series of missile and nuclear tests in defiance of U.N. sanctions, most recently with a failed missile launch on Sunday.

""Those who would challenge our resolve or readiness should know, we will defeat any attack and beat any use of conventional or nuclear weapons with an overwhelming and effective American response,"" Pence said to loud applause, reiterating that all options are on the table in dealing with Pyongyang.

Pence made his remarks as the White House grappled with controversy over the location of the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier strike group that U.S. President Donald Trump said last week had been sent to near the Korean peninsula as a warning to North Korea, but which headed towards Australia instead.

Pence did not mention the Carl Vinson or the controversy.

Pence said he had spoken with Trump and by 2020 some 60 percent of the U.S. naval fleet would be in the region and Japan's role would grow.

""The United States will strengthen its presence in the Asia Pacific,"" he said. ""Japan will assume a larger role and responsibility in our alliance in the years ahead.""

Defence officials from the United States, South Korea and Japan, who were in Tokyo for trilateral security talks, said in a statement North Korea should give up its weapons development irrevocably.

""The officials call on North Korea to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs in a complete, verifiable, and irrevocably manner, to cease its provocative actions that only increase tensions in the region,"" they said.

'Serious Concern'

A senior North Korean official said in an interview with the BBC this week that North Korea would conduct missile tests ""on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis"", and any military action against it by the United States would prompt ""all-out war"".

North Korea's deputy representative to the United Nations, Kim In Ryong, accused the United States on Monday of creating ""a situation where nuclear war could break out an any time"" and said the North's next nuclear test would take place ""at a time and at a place where our headquarters deems necessary"".

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said all parties should make efforts to resolve the situation.

""China expresses serious concern with recent trends about North Korea's nuclear and missile development,"" he said.

The situation was tense and China was resolutely opposed to any words or actions that could further raise tension, he added.

North Korea regularly threatens to destroy Japan, South Korea and the United States and it showed no let-up in its belligerence after the failed missile test on Sunday, a day after putting on a huge display of missiles at a parade in Pyongyang.

Pence also said the United States would protect freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea, where Beijing is entangled in territorial rows with several Southeast Asia nations.

Pence heads for Indonesia later on Wednesday."

“And one newspaper criticized me, ‘Why can’t they have people of modest means?’” Trump said at a Des Moines, Iowa rally. “Because I want people that made a fortune. Because now they’re negotiating with you, okay?”

How rich? CBS News estimates seven of Trump’s picks are worth a combined $11 billion.

Betsy DeVos, nominated for secretary of education, comes from a family worth more than $5 billion; Linda McMahon, picked for small business administrator, has family wealth worth $1.2 billion; And Vincent Viola, the choice for Army secretary, is worth $1.77 billion.

“I guess they have a few poor millionaires on it, but mostly it’s billionaires,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Critics like Sanders say Trump’s choices fly in the face of his populist campaign message. “You don’t appoint a Cabinet of billionaires to be taking on the establishment,” he said on Sunday’s “Face The Nation.”

Steve Mnuchin, Trump’s Treasury pick has been estimated to be worth as much as $655 million. He and commerce secretary nominee Wilbur Ross, worth $2.5 billion, recently said they were attuned to the plight of working Americans.

“It’s also not true all jobs are created equal. A guy that used to work in the steel mill, now flipping hamburgers, he knows it’s not the same,” Ross said in an appearance on CNBC.

Having millionaire and billionaire cabinet secretaries is not unprecedented. They tend to attract slots at Treasury and Commerce. But neither President Obama nor President George W. Bush had a single billionaire in their first Cabinets."

It was taken on Saturday, four days after the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, described its mission in the Sea of Japan.

Now, the Carl Vinson is finally on a course for the Korean Peninsula, expected to arrive in the region next week, according to Defense Department officials. White House officials declined to comment on the confusion, referring questions to the Pentagon. “Sean discussed it once when asked, and it was all about process,” a spokesman, Michael Short, said of Mr. Spicer.

Privately, however, other officials expressed bewilderment that the Pentagon did not correct its timeline, particularly given the tensions in the region and the fact that Mr. Spicer, as well as the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, were publicly answering questions about it.

“The ship is now moving north to the Western Pacific,” the Pentagon’s chief spokeswoman, Dana White, said Tuesday. “This should have been communicated more clearly at the time.”

The miscues began on April 9 when the public affairs office of the Navy’s Third Fleet issued a news release saying that Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., the Pacific commander, had ordered the Carl Vinson, a Nimitz-class nuclear-powered carrier, and its strike force — two destroyers and one cruiser — to leave Singapore and sail to the Western Pacific. As is customary, the Navy did not say exactly where the carrier force was headed or its precise mission.

Given the timing, it hardly needed to: Mr. Trump had just wrapped up a two-day summit meeting with Mr. Xi at his Palm Beach club, Mar-a-Lago, with a message that the United States had run out of patience with North Korea’s dictator, Kim Jong-un, and its nuclear and missile programs.

That Sunday, General McMaster told Fox News that the deployment was a “prudent” move, designed to give the president “a full range of options to remove” the threat posed by Mr. Kim.

What the Navy did not say was that the Carl Vinson had to carry out another mission before it set sail north: a long-scheduled joint exercise with the Australian Navy in the Indian Ocean.

South Korean and Japanese news media, as well as The New York Times, reported Admiral Harris’s order as evidence that the crisis was intensifying. While an aircraft carrier is not the weapon of choice for a strike on North Korea — such an operation would more likely involve long-range bombers and cruise missiles — it sends a vivid message of military might.

In July 2010, President Barack Obama ordered the aircraft carrier George Washington to the Sea of Japan to intimidate the North after it had torpedoed a South Korean Navy corvette, killing 46 sailors. When his defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, asked him to reroute the carrier to the Yellow Sea, to send an additional message to Beijing, Mr. Obama resisted.

“I don’t call audibles with aircraft carriers,” he said, using a football metaphor to reject the midcourse correction.

By all accounts, Mr. Trump is less worried than Mr. Obama about making such calls on the fly. His aides have praised this unpredictability as a virtue in dealing with rogue leaders in North Korea and Syria.

In South Korea, though, fears of a full-blown war erupted. The government rushed to reassure the public that the Carl Vinson was coming only to deter North Korean provocations. April 15 is the birthday of Kim Il-sung, the nation’s founder and the grandfather of Kim Jong-un — an occasion the North typically uses to conduct celebratory weapons tests.

On April 11, Mr. Trump stoked the fears of military action with an early-morning Twitter post: “North Korea is looking for trouble. If China decides to help, that would be great. If not, we will solve the problem without them! U.S.A.” Later that day, Mr. Spicer was asked by a reporter, who assumed the Carl Vinson was on its way north, why the United States had decided to dispatch the carrier group to the Sea of Japan.

“A carrier group is several things,” Mr. Spicer replied. “The forward deployment is deterrence, presence.” He added, “I think when you see a carrier group steaming into an area like that, the forward presence of that is clearly, through almost every instance, a huge deterrence.”

Mr. Spicer did not point out that the Carl Vinson was not, in fact, steaming into the area and would not be for 14 more days. A senior administration official said the press secretary was using talking points supplied by the Pentagon. He was discussing the rationale for sending a carrier, this official said, not confirming the ship’s schedule.

An hour after Mr. Spicer left the podium, Mr. Mattis, the defense secretary, reinforced the perception of ships racing to the scene. Speaking at the Pentagon, he said the Navy disclosed the Carl Vinson’s itinerary in advance because the exercise with the Australians had been canceled. “We had to explain why she wasn’t in that exercise,” he said.

Mr. Mattis, however, had conflated two things: Admiral Harris had canceled only a port call for the Carl Vinson in Fremantle, Australia, according to Pentagon officials, because he feared that images of sailors on shore leave would be unseemly at a time when North Korea was firing missiles.

Navy officials said Admiral Harris never meant to suggest he was canceling the naval exercise. Organizing such exercises is a complicated effort that takes months. One official described it as a high-end exercise, raising the possibility that the two navies practiced scenarios to counter China, or tested new missile defenses or cyberoperations.

Some officials expressed irritation with Admiral Harris, saying he did not think through the consequences of announcing the deployment of an aircraft carrier during a period of high tension.

Mr. Mattis sent mixed signals about the mission. He stressed the need for the Navy to operate freely in the Pacific but added, “There’s not a specific demand signal or specific reason why we’re sending her up there.”

After a week of war drums, fueled by the reports of the oncoming armada, tensions subsided when the weekend passed with only a military parade in Pyongyang and a failed missile test.

Then, on Monday, the Navy posted the photo of the Carl Vinson, bristling with fighter jets as it passed Indonesia. It was spotted by Defense News, a trade publication, which broke the news that the ship was thousands of miles from where most of the world thought it was."

91,http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/benefits-of-water-for-your-body/?a_aid=54e3fadc2316d,newsbbc,Water: The Foundation of a Healthy Body,[],"The human body is a machine designed to run on water and minerals. The body is about 72% water and water is vitally important for every important bodily function. The bottom line is that without water, your body doesn’t work, and the quality of the water you consume can have a dramatic impact on your health.

A Crucial Element to Good Health

The human body has tremendous healing abilities and water is a major component. With proper nourishment and hydration, the body instinctively strives to be young and healthy, working to repair and rebuild bone, regenerate and replace tissue, and attack hostile organisms. In each of these miraculous processes there is one common factor — water.

How Hydration Affects Your Brain and Mental Health

The brain consists of over 75% water and controls nearly every one of the body’s processes by sending and receiving electrical signals through the nervous system. [1] Tiny messengers called “transporter proteins” travel at the speed of light to carry life giving messages to every cell and organ. Like any communication network, the purity of the carrier affects the speed and clarity of the signal. If the fluid, mostly water, inside of nerves is laced with traces of chemicals or toxic metals, the result is a delayed and distorted signal. Many experts believe signal distortion is linked to nervous system disorders like ADD, chronic fatigue syndrome, Alzheimer’s, and mood imbalance. [2]

How Hydration Affects Energy Levels

Water consumption directly affects energy levels. Just a 5% drop in body fluids can cause a 30% reduction in energy; the problem is not uncommon. By some estimates, two-thirds of the population suffers from some degree of chronic hydration. Rather than drink more water, many people turn to stimulants like caffeine and sugar to artificially boost their energy, quickly leading to a downward spiral. Caffeine and sugar are diuretics and cause your body to lose water, resulting in a further loss of energy and a dependency on artificial energy.

Water for Detoxing

The body’s detoxification system is major component to good health and relies heavily on adequate hydration. Filtering and flushing out toxins is very water intensive. It’s just another one of the reasons that staying hydrated has a tremendous impact on health.

How Much Water Do We Need?

We’ve all heard that eight glasses of water each day is an absolute minimum for the body to maintain basic functions. Every time you exhale, blink an eye, or make a movement, water is used. Even the beating of your heart requires water. Keep in mind that eight glasses is the minimum and one half your body weight in ounces is a better measuring stick (for example, if you weigh 180 pounds, drink 90 ounces of water per day).

How to Make Dr. Group’s Toxin-Free “Super Water”

A lot of public drinking water systems have contaminants you’re better off avoiding; drinking purified or distilled water is key. To add a boost to your water, or if you’re drinking distilled water and want to add back some of the minerals lost during the distillation process, try the following recipe.

One gallon distilled or purified water, preferably stored or purchased in a glass container. Add two to three tablespoons of raw, organic apple cider vinegar. If the taste is too strong, reduce to one tablespoon. Optional: Add the juice of one half organic lemon and 1-2 ounces organic aloe vera per gallon of water.

Apparently, some viewers felt the project invoked symbolism of the Illuminati, an ancient secret society that has been linked to contemporary conspiracy theories suggesting an elite group of leaders control the world unbeknownst to the general public.

On Sunday (October 24), 'Ye took to his Twitter page to humorously address rumors that he's a member of the purported society and worships the devil. Apparently, Yeezy has no clue what the society even is.

""I've got question about ""the illuminati"" ... what is it exactly ??? ... and why do people think pop stars have a membership???!!! LOL,"" he tweeted. ""Is illuminati and devil worshipping like the same thing ... do they have a social network that celebs can sign up for?""

The MC also joked about which new tech gadgets and social media outlets would work for his so-called satanic lifestyle.

""Question... can you devil worship on the new iphone??? LOL!!!"" he typed. ""What's better for devil worshipping Iphone or the Droid... Does lucifer return text... is he or she on Skype? Don't wanna be sexist.""

'Ye even took a crack at sparking a devil-friendly trending topic.

""#DoyouthinkLucifer uses in in ear monitors or signature Beats by Dre headphones???!!!"" Yeezy wrote.

The MC did say he was cool with legendary hip-hop spinner and producer DJ Clue, who's known for lacing many of his projects with a chant that sounds similar to Illuminati.

""I am down with Cluemanotti though,"" he wrote. ""That's my boy.""

Yeezy joked about claims that he's down with the devil on Twitter, but he has also recently addressed one of his lyrics that may have riled up fans. In a sit-down with MTV News after the premiere of ""Runaway,"" broke down the meaning of a rhyme from a freestyle he kicked last year that lit up the blogosphere.

""There's this line where I say, 'I sold my soul to the devil, that's a crappy deal,' and all these people said, 'What you mean you sold your soul to the devil?' But when I say it, I'm saying, when I allow other people's ideals to interfere with what I know is true to myself, that's the devil,"" West explained. ""So, it's like, people talking mess on the blogs is the devil or ...trying to call me names, that's what the devil is. And me thinking twice about what it is that's really in my heart because of what people's reaction would be is me selling my soul to the devil.""

The lyricist maintained that he will no longer let others' opinions stifle his creative expression.

""You're on earth for only 80, 90 a hundred years,"" he said. ""I have to create from my dreams, from the dreams I had as a 5-year-old, and use everything — all the greatest people and all the tools I have around me — and ask as many questions as I can to help facilitate and bring this out. And this [film] is one of the first examples of a dream coming true.""

Yeezy isn't the only hip-hop star to catch heat about a visual supposedly packed with satanic imagery. Jay-Z and Swizz Beatz batted away rumors, earlier this year, that the slick video for their collabo ""On to the Next One"" was riddled with demonic references.

93,http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/6-health-benefits-of-eating-organic-food/?a_aid=54e3fadc2316d,newsbbc,6 Health Benefits of Eating Organic Food,[],"Agribusiness is all about profits, not your health. It is an industry that has developed a system of food production that’s completely forgotten what food is all about: nutrition and health — not to mention taste. It’s gotten so bad that it’s becoming difficult to even call the stuff that agribusiness produces food. It would be more honest if they were to call it “stuff for ingestion” and include a warning label.

The voice of those of us who are not interested in what’s now called “conventional” farming is ever increasing. We’re not interested in consuming chemicals, toxins, or GMOs. What are we interested in? Organic food. Why? It’s better. Here’s a quick list of six reasons why you should make it a point to consume organic whenever possible.

1. No GMOs

Genetically modified organisms, including GM foods, are a horrible mutation of real food. The claim that GMOs are just like any other method of improving foods is simply nonsense. Never before have genetics been manipulated by taking the genes from one species and inserting them into another.

Animal genes are spliced into plants, and plant genes into animals, something that cannot happen in nature. The claims that GMOs and breeding are virtually identical and safe are clearly nonsense, with studies like the one done by Gilles-Eric Séralini showing that rats fed a diet of Roundup-Ready GM corn developed massive tumors and died younger. [1]

Although other countries in the world have rightfully shut the door on GMO junk being sold within their boundaries, organic foods are the only foods that people in America can be reasonably sure are GMO-free!

2. Better Nutrition

Conventionally grown “stuff for ingestion” is produced in played-out soil under the delusion that all the nutrients you require can be replaced by artificially-produced fertilizers. There is a fallacy that bigger and prettier produce is synonymous with healthy produce. The fact is that study after study has proven that organic food is more nutritious. By the way, more nutritious food usually tastes better, too.

Here are some nutrient facts reported by Organic.org: [2]

One study showed that organic fruits and veggies contain 27% more vitamin C, 21.1% more iron, 29.3% more magnesium, 13.6% more phosphorus, and 18% more polyphenols.

Salicylic acid is an important and health-promoting substance. Researchers have found that there is an average of 600% more salicylic acid in organic soups, and that organic carrot and coriander soup contains 1,040 nanograms of it, compared with only 20 nanograms in typical nonorganic soups!

Organic meats are less fatty, and the fats are healthier.

The only US beef that has been free of the fatal prion brain disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob, is organic.

The science is clear: organic food is more nutritious.

3. No Pesticides or Herbicides

Pesticides and herbicides are poison. It’s that simple. Their function is to poison things. Food that’s grown with the use of pesticides and herbicides are, therefore, poisonous. Don’t kid yourself into believing that you can effectively wash it off. You cannot. For lack of better words, it’s in all the nooks and crannies. It’s taken up by the roots and soaked in when it’s sprayed. Nearly all pesticides function by harming the nervous system. So, if you eat foods that were grown by agribusiness, you are eating neurotoxins and gradually poisoning your nervous system. [3]

The way to avoid these poisons is to eat only organic foods.

4. Higher Quality Meat and Dairy

When you see studies claiming that meat is bad for you, take note that they never distinguish between organic husbandry and the stuff that comes from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). If you eat most of the stuff sold for ingestion that supermarkets sell, then you should pay attention because that stuff is truly bad for you. It’s loaded with antibiotics and other drugs, and it is, frankly, dirty. Animals raised wallowing in their own feces and the stench of old urine are not healthy. If you eat meat that comes from such places, you’re not helping your health. [4]

If you’re going to eat meat, the way to avoid such cruelty to animals and unhealthy meat is simple: Eat only organic and free range meats.

5. Less Chance of Food-Borne Illness

The news media keeps reporting about massive outbreaks of food-borne illness. Cabbage. Eggs. Fast food restaurants. Spinach. Melons. Peanut butter. The list goes on and on. The more our foods are produced by agribusiness, the more such outbreaks happen.

What the news media fails to report is that virtually every one of these outbreaks is a direct result of agribusiness. Animals in CAFOs are sick. No matter how much they’re vaccinated or drugged, they just get more sick. Factory farms are the primary source of drug-resistant infections. In fact, they were the first source. E. coli was not even considered an infectious bacterium until around 1983. It’s a necessary probiotic found in everyone’s gut. It’s necessary for digestion. The E. coli that causes deadly infections is a mutant caused by CAFOs. [5]

The best way to be safe from food-borne illness is to choose organic foods. The insane rush to sterilize our foods and farms simply makes us less healthy, and ultimately results in exposure to the worst food-borne illnesses that have ever existed.

6. Better for Your Conscience

By now, it’s clear that the stuff for ingestion sold by most supermarkets is devastating for our health, devastating for the animals raised for this travesty, and devastating to the environment. So, my final health benefit of eating organic is your conscience.

When you’re aware of the devastation brought by agribusiness to animals and the environment, surely your conscience suffers-and the fact is that a bad conscience is bad for your health. So do yourself a huge favor — make organic food as big a part of your diet as possible. Not only will your health benefit, but so will the rest of the world. In fact, it may be the most important action you ever take.

94,http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2016/10/04/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-fabricated/,newsbbc,"Kim Kardashian, Kanye West Could Face Criminal Charges Over Paris Robbery",[],"Kim Kardashian, Kanye West Could Face Criminal Charges Over Paris Robbery

Was it all made up? Strangely, no surveillance footage has been found, despite reports of a robbery involving five people. Now, French officials may be wondering if Kim Kardashian and Kanye West fabricated the entire thing.

Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are masters of the publicity stunt, but the pair may have gone too far last weekend in Paris. Yesterday, Digital Music News raised a number of glaring problems with the reported jewelry heist, including the possibility that the story was completely fabricated.

It just doesn’t seem to pass the sniff test. And that could be a big, big problem for French officials desperately trying to repair the image of Paris.

Among the obvious problems are the absence of any security the night of the heist, the presence of just one night watchman in the entire hotel, an immediate escape by Kardashian and the watchman despite being tied up, and the absence of even one message to the outside (including from another person downstairs in the multi-level suite).

No security footage captured.

But this one may just take the cake. According to details somehow ‘leaked’ to TMZ, there isn’t any security footage of the crime. Somehow, a five-person crew managed to evade every single camera, either inside the hotel or outside the building. At this point, no other cameras have recorded anything, even though Paris is littered with cameras on every block.

In fact, one police surveillance camera outside the building shows zero activity. That could be because it was pointed away from the building, or, perhaps there was absolutely nothing to record.

Additionally, there isn’t one witness to the crime outside Kim Kardashian and the unidentified night watchman. Fashion stylist Simone Harouche, who called the cops after allegedly hearing screams from Kardashian on the hotel balcony, has declined to comment.

Back in the US, even Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer is raising questions about the heist. Opining about a separate case, Breyer referenced “Kardashian’s thief, if there is one.”

No leads, no suspects, no nothing .

More importantly, French police seem to have absolutely no leads in this case. Nobody saw anyone riding a bicycle in a police uniform, or even walking away. Not one witness has come forward, if a witness even exists. In fact, not one individual has even been detained, with French police failing to name one suspect.

All of which raises the possibility of a criminal probe ahead by French authorities. For starters, Paris is a city suffering billions in losses from slumping tourism, thanks to a spate of horrific terrorist attacks. Add a complicated jewelry heist into the mix, and the world’s most visited city could suffer another plunge in tourism.

French authorities may be considering a serious criminal investigation, if only to prove to the world that Paris is safe to visit.

Ryan Lochte, anyone?

Strangely, Kardashian’s reported heist bears an uncanny resemblance to a recent robbery wise tale. During the recent Olympics in Rio, American swimmer Ryan Lochte claimed that robbers dressed as police officers accosted him with guns. That story was widely accepted by the mainstream media, though Brazilian officials smelled a rat.

For starters, the Rio ‘robbers’ decided not to steal an expensive watch, among other glaring inconsistencies. Soon, video footage revealed that Lochte and team were merely vandalizing a gas station bathroom while drunk, while urinating outside a locked door. The ‘robbers’ were actually security guards trying to control the situation.

Ultimately, Lochte was shamed for cooking up a story and almost damaging the reputation of Rio. Could Kim Kardashian and Kanye West be guilty of the same crime?

More as this develops."

The comments in the Global Times, a popular paper known for its inflammatory rhetoric and hawkish views, came just days after President Xi Jinping called for the eventual global elimination of atomic weapons.

In recent days, Chinese social media has carried pictures purporting to show an advanced intercontinental ballistic missile system deployed in the northeast.

The Dongfeng-41 is reportedly a nuclear road-mobile missile thought to have a payload of 10-12 warheads and a range of 14,000km, according to the Global Times.

The paper, a subsidiary of the Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily, plays to nationalist sentiment and is often believed to channel hardline views within the government.

The Global Times said some media claimed the People's Liberation Army leaked the photos as a warning to Trump.

""They think this is Beijing's response to Trump's provocative remarks on China,"" it added.

The US president, who took office Friday, has rattled Beijing with tough talk on trade and national security.

On Monday White House spokesman Sean Spicer warned China the US would ""defend"" American and international interests in the disputed South China Sea, where China has built a series of artificial islands capable of military use.

""If those islands are, in fact, in international waters and not part of China proper, yeah, we'll make sure we defend international interests from being taken over by one country,"" he said.

Trump's nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, said last week China's access to the islands might be blocked - raising the prospect of a military confrontation.

China lays claim to a vast stretch of the waterway within a so-called ""nine dash line,"" including waters claimed by several of its neighbours.

The Global Times said Trump had called repeatedly for a US nuclear arms build-up.

""Even Washington feels that its naval forces and nuclear strength are lacking, so how can China be content with its current nuclear strength when it is viewed by the US as its biggest potential opponent?"" it asked.

The paper said China's nuclear forces ""must be so strong that no country would dare launch a military showdown"" with it.

""China must procure a level of strategic military strength that will force the US to respect it."" The comments were in marked contrast to Xi's speech at the United Nations days earlier.

""Nuclear weapons should be completely prohibited and destroyed over time to make the world free of nuclear weapons,"" Xi said.

China has been a nuclear power since 1964.

The PLA has been flexing its muscles since Trump's election, showing off upgraded combat aircraft and new fighters. The country's only aircraft carrier entered the Taiwan Strait this month in a symbolic show of strength.

On Monday the PLA navy announced it had commissioned its fifth ""carrier killer"" guided-missile destroyer and delivered it to the North Sea Fleet.

The system is believed to be designed to deter the US Navy, which has the world's largest number of carriers."

In a breaking news story, we have received evidence that Obama and John Kerry did not require Irans leaders to sign the nuclear deal that his team negotiated with the regime, and the deal is not “legally binding,” his administration acknowledged.

Obama and Iran agreed that a legally binding deal would be strongly discouraged and disapproved of in the United States, so they wanted to skip the “legally binding” part and just give Iran everything they asked for if Iran promised not to use the nuclear weapons on countries.

In a non legally binding agreement, Iran was given:

Advertisement

A lift on $100 billion in sanctions.

They were paid more than $36 billion for “long overdue actions.”

Unlimited access to trade with Europe again.

A lift on the arms embargo. They can buy and sell weapons from anyone, anywhere, anytime they want to.

They are allowed to run “safety tests” on themselves.

They report “illegal actions” themselves to the U.N. Meaning, Iran will tell Obama and the U.N. if they are acting criminally or inappropriately.

What the United States got:

Anti-American propaganda videos where American sailors were captured and humiliated.

Iran has test-fired an illegal long-range missile on several occasions.

Iran detained dozens of Americans and held them until Obama paid them a ransom.

That is it. We got absolutely nothing. We armed a jihadi maniac with nuclear weapons and gave them everything they asked for.

There is a silver lining: The deal was never signed, so two things can occur.

First, Trump can rip the deal up on day one and we can place all of the restrictions and bans right back on Iran while forcing them to destroy their nuclear systems.

Second, this was a clear act of treason by Obama and Kerry, and they should be charged once Trump is in office. The United States labels Iran as the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism, so that means the United States is working with terrorists.

Under the “Stop Funding Terrorists Bill,” which is going to House floor next week, if Republicans vote to pass this, Obama and any other government agency or official that supplies terrorists can be charged with treason.

Would you support Donald Trump charging Obama and Kerry with treason for this horrendous deal that placed the entire world at risk?

104,http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/donald-trumps-new-attack-ad-896660,newsbbc,Donald Trump's New Attack Ad Features Bill Clinton Accuser Juanita Broaddrick,['Ryan Parker'],"The black and white spot runs for about 20 seconds and includes quotes from a 1999 interview on 'Dateline.'

On Monday, Donald Trump released over social media his newest attack ad against Hillary Clinton which focuses on her husband, former President Bill Clinton.

Along with the ad, the presumptive GOP presidential candidate asks: ""Is Hillary really protecting women?""

The black and white spot runs for about 20 seconds and features women's voices, including Juanita Broaddrick, who accused Bill Clinton of rape. Bill Clinton is shown with a cigar in his mouth. The ad ends with Hillary laughing and the words: ""Here we go again?""

In a Dateline NBC interview that aired in February 1999, Broaddrick talked about Clinton in 1978, then Attorney General of Arkansas, sexually assaulting her.

In a particularly emotional part of her interview, Broaddrick describes the aggressive way Clinton was allegedly kissing her while she was trying to ward off his advances.

""He starts to bite on my top lip and I try to pull away from him,"" Broaddrick said in the interview. This is the exact segment Trump uses in his new attack ad.

Broaddrick sued Bill Clinton in 1999 to stop the White House from keeping files on her in order to ""smear and destroy her reputation."" The suit was dismissed in 2001.

These days, Broaddrick uses Twitter — her account verified by multiple reporters — to criticize Hillary Clinton and continue to tell her story about the former president.

I was 35 years old when Bill Clinton, Ark. Attorney General raped me and Hillary tried to silence me. I am now 73....it never goes away. — Juanita Broaddrick (@atensnut) January 6, 2016

Thoroughly disgusting--Hillary's comments on rape. Shame on you, Hillary, shame on you!! — Juanita Broaddrick (@atensnut) September 15, 2015

105,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/world/middleeast/iran-is-said-to-detain-another-american.html,newsbbc,Iran Is Said to Detain Another Iranian-American,['Thomas Erdbrink'],"Word of Mr. Namazi’s arrest, which was reported by The Washington Post on Thursday, came as the political atmosphere in Iran is again taking a turn toward the strident anti-Americanism that prevailed before the talks that led to the nuclear accord, which Iran negotiated with six world powers, including the United States.

Mr. Namazi had been in Tehran since September, when he was visiting from Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, where he lives. He had apparently intended the trip to be short. His passport was confiscated, said the people close to him, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because his arrest has not been officially announced.

Mr. Namazi’s relatives declined to comment. Officials at Crescent Petroleum did not respond to attempts to reach them by telephone and email for comment.

Mark Toner, a deputy spokesman for the State Department, issued a statement in response to queries about Mr. Namazi: “We’re aware of recent reports of the possible arrest in Iran of a person reported to have U.S. citizenship. We’re looking into these reports and don’t have anything further to provide at this time.”

The arrest coincided with increasingly shrill accusations by some members of Iran’s Parliament that one of the other imprisoned Iranian-Americans, Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post’s Tehran correspondent, heads a network of spies. Mr. Rezaian, arrested in July 2014, was convicted of espionage this month, but the details and his sentence have not been made public.

The Iranian authorities have also imprisoned Saeed Abedini, a Christian pastor, and Amir Hekmati, a Marine veteran. There had been hopes that all would be freed after the nuclear accord was reached.

Experts on Iranian politics said the reported arrest of Mr. Namazi was a signal of a possible backlash by opponents of the nuclear agreement in Iran. They view the accord as a nefarious way for Americans to gain influence in Iranian society.

“It’s not a good sign for those who want to open Iran to the West and the United States,” said Alireza Nader, an Iran specialist at the RAND Corporation in Washington.

Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has made clear in speeches and letters that in his view the nuclear agreement should not lead to more cooperation with the United States. In September, he called on the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps to “guard the Islamic Revolution,” and he warned that the United States was trying to “infiltrate” the country, politically and culturally.

Mr. Namazi, a graduate of Tufts University, moved between the United States and Iran, settling down in Tehran in the mid-1990s. He and some relatives started a successful consulting firm, Atieh Bahar, that advised Western oil and multinational companies.

After the 2009 re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose administration accused the company of having improper relations with Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former president and rival to Mr. Ahmadinejad, Atieh Bahar’s top leadership was ousted. Harassed by security forces, Mr. Namazi left Iran in 2009.

He returned for brief family visits after the 2013 election of Mr. Ahmadinejad’s successor, Hassan Rouhani, who had campaigned on a desire to have the Western economic sanctions on Iran eased. In September, The Daily Beast published a highly critical, anonymously written article about Mr. Namazi and his family.

The Daily Beast article, which friends of Mr. Namazi have said they believe was part of a campaign to incriminate him, said that he played a leading role in the National Iranian American Council. The group said in a statement on its website on Thursday that neither Mr. Namazi nor his family “have had any leadership or any other significant role.”"
106,http://www.trueactivist.com/donations-to-the-clinton-foundation-plummet-as-familys-political-clout-evaporates/,newsbbc,Donations To The Clinton Foundation Plummet As Family’s Political Clout Evaporates,"['Whitney Webb', 'True Activist']","Following her “shocking” loss in the recent US election, donations to Hillary Clinton's family foundation are drying up as her political career is effectively over.

During the recent US presidential campaign season, there was no shortage of controversy as both candidates were regularly embroiled in scandals regarding their financial dealings and other questionable acts. Wikileaks, through its releases of emails tied to Clinton insiders, focused much more attention on Hillary Clinton’s scandals as mountains of evidence began to emerge exposing the corruption inherent in her political career and her family’s “charitable” foundation. The Clinton Foundation became so controversial that it even made its way onto the presidential debate stage, with Clinton’s opponent and now-President Elect Donald Trump threatening to hire a special prosecutor to investigate the foundation’s financial dealings.

Some of the chief allegations surrounding the foundation was its facilitation of Clinton’s “pay-to-play” dealings that occurred while Clinton was both a private citizen and US Secretary of State. In one egregious example, the King of Morocco “donated” $12 million to the Clinton Foundation in return for a meeting with Hillary, ultimately resulting in a $157 million weapons deal for the African monarchy only a few months later. Though the Clintons have long maintained that the foundation is a simple, innocent charity not connected to political favors, new post-election evidence is painting a different picture.

With Clinton’s loss, her family is effectively out of politics and their reputation stained by the numerous scandals that appeared during the campaign. As the family’s political clout dries up, so to has their foundation’s donations, suggesting that these donations were not for charitable purposes and instead for political favors and access. Prior the election, the wealthy Norwegian government was previously the donation’s third largest donor after Australia and Saudi Arabia. Between 2007-2013, Norway donated around $5 million annually to the foundation. However, when Hillary’s decision to run for president was all but confirmed, Norway’s donations increased significantly to $15 million in 2014 and $21 million in 2015. Now, with Clinton out of power, Norway’s contributions to foundation have plummeted by 87%, totaling $2.6 million – less than half of their pre-election contributions.

Foreign governments aren’t the only ones seeking to distance themselves from the Clintons and their foundation. As the “pay to play” allegations began to surface overall donations to the foundation dropped 37% with major donors such as Samsung and ExxonMobil cutting their ties completely. Internal strife between Clinton insiders and Chelsea Clinton as well as a low rating from a charity watchdog were also likely contributing factors. In addition, Hillary Clinton’s private speech revenue has also suffered. In 2014, Clinton made a massive $3.6 million from private speeches alone. However, that figure has now fallen to $357,500. It seems the political fallout from Hillary’s loss and numerous scandals is having much more of an effect than was anticipated, which may explain her visibly strained appearance at her only post-election speech.

However, the Clintons aren’t likely to give up their empire of influence that easily. According to rumors, Chelsea Clinton is expected to run for a congressional seat in the near future, which would keep the Clinton “brand” alive to the chagrin of many Americans.

ONE week after Kim Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in Paris while her security guard Pascal Duvier was out of the picture, the reality star has been left by the guard again.

German born Pascal was spotted accompanying Kim’s husband Kanye West to his gig in Chicago, leaving Kim with their two children, ten-month old Saint and North, three, in Los Angeles.

Kanye previously left the concert halfway through his set in Chicago after he received news of the robbery.

The rapper told the crowd during his performance: “I can safely say that tonight is a victory,” he told the crowd at one point.

“If your dreams keep you up at night and your ideas keep you up at night then your vision will come alive.”

Pascal faced criticism after Kim was left unprotected at the couple’s base in the French capital.

Despite her terrifying ideal, Kim made sure no blame was laid at Pascal’s door with sources confirming he would continue working for the family.

Following Putin’s remarks that Democrat’s and Clinton are losing in a most undignified manner, Trump commented that his remarks are “So true!”

“Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and Dems: “In my opinion, it is humiliating. One must be able to lose with dignity.” So true!” Trump tweeted.

Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and Dems: ""In my opinion, it is humiliating. One must be able to lose with dignity."" So true! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2016

The Economic Times reports:

At his annual news conference in Moscow yesterday, Putin said the Democrats “are losing on all fronts and looking elsewhere for things to blame”, The Washington Post reported.

“In my view, this, how shall I say it, degrades their own dignity. You have to know how to lose with dignity,” he said.

The Democratic party and the Clinton Campaign have been blaming Russian hacking into their emails and servers for their loss.

Outgoing US President Barack Obama has ordered an investigation into the alleged Russian interference in US presidential elections.

Putin criticised the Democrats for blaming him for their defeat.

“Outstanding figures in American history from the ranks of the Democratic Party would likely be turning in their graves. Roosevelt certainly would be,” Putin said.

“Trump understood the mood of the people and kept going until the end, when nobody believed in him… except for you and me,” he added.

Earlier yesterday, the Trump Transition Team released a letter from Putin to Trump in which he called for strong bilateral relationship.

“Serious global and regional challenges, which our countries have to face in recent years, show that the relations between Russia and the US remain an important factor in ensuring stability and security of the modern world,” Putin wrote.

“I hope that after you assume the position of the President of the United States of America we will be able – by acting in a constructive and pragmatic manner – to take real steps to restore the framework of bilateral cooperation in different areas as well as bring our level of collaboration on the international scene to a qualitatively new level,” said the Russian President.

“Please accept my sincere wishes to you and your family of sound health, happiness, well-being, success and all the best,” Putin wrote as per the unofficial translation of the letter released by the Presidential Transition Team.

Trump praised the letter, saying a “very nice letter from Vladimir Putin; his thoughts are so correct. I hope both sides are able to live up to these thoughts, and we do not have to travel an alternate path”."

On Friday the U.S. government formally accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations.

In a joint public statement the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said it was confident that Russia’s most senior officials had ordered the attacks.

According to the joint statement, “disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts.”

Breaking: Joint statement from intel director & homeland security attributing recent political hacks to Russian gov pic.twitter.com/W5XziuzI7X — Shane Harris (@shaneharris) October 7, 2016

The Mail Online reports:

The statement amounts to an accusation that Vladimir Putin ordered interference in the American political system.

It is impossible for such an explosive charge to have been made without authorization from President Obama.

The statement said: ‘The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.

‘We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia’s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.’

It added: ‘It would be extremely difficult for someone, including a nation-state actor, to alter actual ballot counts or election results by cyber attack or intrusion.

‘This assessment is based on the decentralized nature of our election system in this country and the number of protections state and local election officials have in place. States ensure that voting machines are not connected to the Internet, and there are numerous checks and balances as well as extensive oversight at multiple levels built into our election process.’

The statement comes just hours after Secretary of State John Kerry called for Russia to face a war crimes investigation over its actions in Syria “

Moscow dismissed Kerry’s words as “propaganda” intended to distract from US failure to implement the Syrian ceasefire agreement."

113,http://time.com/25150/rape-victims-talk-about-tweeting-their-experiences-publicly/,newsbbc,Is a Twitter Debate about Sexual Assault a Legitimate form of Healing?,[],"JoAnne Cusick was wearing a pink floral sundress and jelly sandals when she was sexually assaulted at the age of eight by a group of neighborhood boys. Believing that she was to blame, she kept the secret for nine years until she told a priest about the attack during confession. He assured her that she was innocent in the eyes of God, and the eyes of the world.

Twenty-eight years later, Cusick, now a 37-year-old nurse living in Colorado, shared that secret on social media joining hundreds of other victims who tweeted their stories of assault. These women (and a number of men) were responding to a simple question that went viral on Twitter Wednesday night asking victims what they were wearing when they were assaulted. Within hours, a long list of outfits—ranging from sweatshirts to pajamas to bathing suits—accompanied by stories of rape and assault filled Twitter feeds, replacing the normal news items and GIFs.

The huge response ignited a conversation on social media and blogs among victims and health professionals as to whether sharing stories on highly public, semi-anonymous social media forums could be a healthy step in the recovery process—a way to make those who've been assaulted feel less alone, less stigmatized and shamed. Or does sharing leave survivors open to online shaming and undermine a more traditional route of coping, like therapy?

The debate started when Christine Fox, a young woman who tweets under the handle @steenfox, got into an argument on Twitter with a follower who insisted that women who wear revealing outfits are at fault if they are sexually assaulted. Fox i nvited those on the social media network who had been victims of rape or sexual assault to tweet the outfits they wore at the time of the attack in hopes of convincing this man not to victim blame.

""I was trying to make him understand that it absolutely does not make a difference, and that the responsibility does not lie on women,"" she told The Root. Over the next several hours, Fox received hundreds of replies. With the users' permission, she retweeted stories as she received them.

The campaign of sorts took on another life when Adrienne Simpson from Philadelphia, who has never been a victim of sexual assault, saw the conversation on Twitter and thought that it could take on a new visual format. ""I am a marketer, so I think in campaigns and imagery,"" she tells TIME. ""I was thinking they need pictures with this because that's what's going to drive home the idea that you can have on corduroy pants and a camouflage shirt—there's nothing remotely sexual about that—and this can still happen to you.""

She created five images from the texts of five tweets that caught her attention: the camouflage shirt and cords a 15-year-old had been wearing; a school uniform (buttoned-up polo, knee-length khaki shorts) worn by a 13-year-old; a sundress a 19-year-old was wearing to Church on Sunday when she was raped by her 50-year-old minister; jeans and a hoodie for a 22-year-old girl who was acting as a designated driver at a party and whose soda was roofied; and—the one that got the most retweets all night—the Barney pajamas worn by a seven-year-old when she was raped.

She added a hashtag: #RapeHasNoUniform. “I think as a victim, when you speak out, you want it to matter. The bigger this gets, the more it matters. I think it should be an organized, public campaign.”

But without expecting attention or publicity, many just tweeted in the hopes of helping others. “[The assault] had nothing to do with anything I did. And I think hearing one survivor being able to say that is a good for people who may still be blaming themselves,” Cusick tells TIME. She has shared her story with friends before, and says she felt comfortable opening up on Twitter.

Sarah Webster said she tweeted with a similar motive. Webster has tweeted about her assault in the past and says that nothing is too private for her to share on her account, which is focused on sex and body image. During the course of the Twitter conversation, the question of whether most assailants are strangers or not arose, and Webster decided it was important to share her story. Webster says she was raped by someone she was very close to and hoped her experience would show others that even those you trust can be perpetrators. ""I was sexually assaulted by someone I knew, and at the time I wasn't wearing anything at all. It was in my home by someone who was never supposed to do that to me,"" she says. ""I wanted to contribute another side of the story.""

Scott Berkowitz, the President and Founder of the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN) was not surprised that seeing so many people share the same experience on Twitter motivated people to share their stories for the first time. ""Having this whole community of other people who have been through something similar can be really empowering for people,"" he says. ""I think there's safety in numbers. We see that in a lot of scenarios with sexual assault survivors. When there's allegations, say, against a particular priest that becomes public, suddenly many other people who were abused by that person are okay with coming forward.""

Those who posted compared the spontaneous movement to Take Back the Night and Slut Walk—two organized campaigns that have aimed to create safe environments for rape victims to share their stories, debunk the notion of victim blaming and restore safety to campuses and neighborhoods. The popularity of such projects proves that large groups of victims speaking out can bolster other survivors' confidence. But unlike past movements, this one took place on social media, which can be simultaneously both anonymous and extremely public.

Anyone on the Internet can read your tweets; and anyone on Twitter can respond to them. You can choose how much information you share about your real identity in your Twitter profile. Some shared their experiences anonymously; others had names and faces attached to their profiles and hence, their stories. Either way many thousands of strangers read their tweets, a fact that became controversial when some media outlets reprinted the tweets and were accused of doing so without everyone's permission. An argument ensued as to whether tweets are public or private and whether extra consideration should be given to sensitive cases such as this one .

The anonymity, after all, is exactly what convinced some victims to share their stories. Many of those who posted who I interviewed said that though Twitter was public, their family didn't know that they tweeted and were unlikely to see the tweets. Sharing their story on Twitter with other survivors felt safer than sharing on someplace like Facebook where their tight circle, that might include family members who don't know about the assault or even the assailant him or herself, might be able to see.

RAINN has found that some anonymity helps those who have never shared before. ""We launched an online hotline in 2006 to compliment our telephone hotline because we were finding that younger victims in particular just weren’t comfortable picking up the phone and saying out loud what happened to them,"" says Berkowitz. ""But that sitting in the privacy of their room at their computer with at least a measure of anonymity there that they tend to open up much more.""

But that's an anonymous hotline. Twitter is a public forum, where there's always gong to be backlash. “In a [therapy] group, you generally sign a confidentiality agreement. There are no agreements on Twitter. Nobody cares about you. It’s the Internet,” says Nicole Aghaaliandastjerdi who shared her experience and now runs a women’s abuse support group in Louisville, KY. Along with all the supportive messages came the the kind of slut-shaming that originally spurred the conversation. “I remember someone was tweeting, ‘Look at all the damaged goods.’ That was really hard for even me to read, and I’m pretty far along in my healing process.”

Despite such comments, Aghaaliandastjerdi focuses on the good that came out of it, like her friend who had only shared once before but decided to participate on Twitter. “That was huge for her. For a lot of people, they’re taking back whatever had been taken from them. They’re claiming it and giving the story a different kind of power.”

Indeed, many first-time sharers found safety in numbers. Clifford Johnson, 31, hadn't shared his story before except with a few close family members. “When I think about it, it kind me feel like a little less than a man—just the fact that it happened.”

But seeing others share their story and the ease of tweeting allowed him to post. ""I don't think I intended to go that deep. I almost deleted it because I didn't know if I wanted this out there."" But as people began to respond he changed his mind. “It was a forum for the first time I was able to say what happened and get feedback from other people who went through the same thing. Plus, everyone there was a woman, you know? And it just kind of got me to thinking about things that happened to me as a child, and I wanted to put it out there to say, ‘It doesn’t matter what you’re wearing. It doesn’t even matter your race or sex. It could happen to anybody.’”

The experience made him want to become involved in advocacy for male victims of rape.

The Twitter conversation was a healing process for many of those who participated. The majority of responses were ones of love and support from strangers.

""What made me feel okay is that it’s so much more prevalent than one might initially think. Even though in my personal network that I follow I didn’t see anyone else respond, the fact that there were so many people responding to the question made me realize it’s not an uncommon thing,"" says Ayanna who wanted her last name to be withheld and tweeted despite the fact that her ex-boyfriend and assailant still follows her on social media. ""Some women tweeted at me who had been through the same thing. They really identified with what I said and it made me feel validated in my decision.""

Of the seven assault survivors I interviewed, none regretted having tweeted.

“I’m sure hundreds of people probably woke up today with a heavy burden lifted off them,"" Johnson says."

116,http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/refined-sugar-toxic-to-your-health/?a_aid=54e3fadc2316d,newsbbc,Refined Sugar: Sweet but Toxic to Your Health,[],"Most of us recognize that sugar does not promote good health. In fact, most people know that sugar is unhealthy, but not everyone understands the full extent of its unhealthiness. Refined sugar, such as high fructose corn syrup, is nothing but empty calories and it’s highly addictive; artificial sweeteners like aspartame are even worse. Sugar is added to many food products and it’s almost impossible to escape.

There was a time when bread consisted of flour, yeast, salt, and water. Now, sugar and a number of other, questionable ingredients can be found in most types of bread. For example, we looked at a few of the most popular brands of white bread on the market. For most, just two slices account for almost 20% of your daily sodium allowance, have more calories than beer, almost no fiber, and about 6 grams of sugar in the form of high fructose corn syrup.[1]

What Makes Refined Sugar Toxic to the Body

The dangers of sugar have been known for decades. William Dufty described the sugar problem in his book Sugar Blues , published in 1975.[1]

“Refined sugar has been depleted of its life forces, vitamins and minerals. What is left consists of pure, refined carbohydrates. The body cannot utilize this refined starch and carbohydrate unless the depleted proteins, vitamins and minerals are present. Nature supplies these elements in each plant in quantities sufficient to metabolize the carbohydrate in that particular plant. There is no excess for other added carbohydrates. Incomplete carbohydrate metabolism results in the formation of ‘toxic metabolite’ such as pyruvic acid and abnormal sugars containing five carbon atoms. Pyruvic acid accumulates in the brain and nervous system and the abnormal sugars in the red blood cells. These toxic metabolites interfere with the respiration of the cells. They cannot get sufficient oxygen to survive and function normally. In time, some of the cells die. This interferes with the function of a part of the body and is the beginning of degenerative disease.”

“Refined sugar is lethal when ingested by humans because it provides only that which nutritionists describe as ‘empty’ calories. It lacks the natural minerals which are present in sugar beet or cane.”

“In addition, sugar is worse than nothing because it drains and leaches the body of precious vitamins and minerals through the demand its digestion, detoxification, and elimination makes upon one’s entire system.”

William Dufty may have been ahead of his time; he understood that acidity leads to health problems.

“Sugar taken every day produces a continuously overacid (sic) condition, and more and more minerals are required from deep in the body in the attempt to rectify the imbalance. To protect the blood, so much calcium is taken from the bones and teeth that decay and general weakening begin. Excess sugar eventually affects every organ in the body.”

When Sugar Enters the Body

Initially, sugar is stored in the liver. When the liver can no longer handle the load, excess sugar, known as glycogen, is returned to the blood as fatty acids. Fatty acids are stored in organs such as the heart and kidneys. Here the tissues degenerate and turn to fat, affecting the whole body.

“The circulatory and lymphatic systems are invaded, and the quality of the red corpuscles starts to change. An overabundance of white cells occurs, and the creation of tissue becomes slower. Our body’s tolerance and immunizing power become limited. We cannot respond properly to extreme attacks, whether they be cold, heat, mosquitoes or microbes.”

“When refined sugar is taken daily, these bacteria wither and die, and our stock of B vitamins gets very low. Too much sugar makes one sleepy; our ability to calculate and remember is lost.”

There is also a strong correlation between sugar consumption and diabetes.[2] Sugar-filled foods and soft drinks have led to a diabetes epidemic. In the U.S., almost 30 million people have diabetes and 86 million adults over 20 have pre-diabetes. One in four diabetic Americans does not even know they have the disease.[3]

“In 1929, in Panama, for sugar plantation owners who ate large amounts of their refined stuff, diabetes was common. However, native cane-cutters, who only chewed the raw cane, saw no diabetes.”

The Sugar Industry’s Creative Marketing Tactics

The sugar takeover is no accident. Serious marketing efforts and even more serious dollars are at work. There are actually many similarities between big tobacco and the sugar producers. Both have invested billions of dollars developing creative ways to convince consumers that their deadly products are actually healthy.

“Beginning with World War I, the sugar pushers coated their propaganda with a preparedness pitch. Dietitians have known the high food value of sugar for a long time, said an industry tract of the 1920s. But it took World War I to bring this home. The energy-building power of sugar reaches the muscles in minutes and it was of value to soldiers as a ration given them just before an attack was launched.”

“Later, the sugar pushers advertised that sugar was chemically pure, being 99.9 percent pure. ‘No food of our everyday diet is purer,’ we were assured. What was meant by purity, besides the unarguable fact that all vitamins, minerals, salts, fibers, and proteins had been removed in the refining process? Well, the sugar pushers came up with a new slant on purity. ‘You don’t have to sort it like beans, wash it like rice. Every grain is like every other. No waste attends its use. No useless bones like in meat, no grounds like coffee. ‘Pure’ is a favorite adjective of the sugar pushers because it means one thing to the chemists and another thing to the ordinary mortals.”

The Carbohydrate Deception

Rebranding sugar as “carbohydrates” was another clever way to influence consumers. While technically true, the phrasing creates an impression that sugars are like other carbohydrates, such as cereal grains. Today, sugar is still listed under “Total Carbohydrates” on the Nutrition Facts label of food products.

“The use of the word “carbohydrate” to describe sugar is deliberately misleading. Since the improved labeling of nutritional properties was required, refined carbohydrates like sugar are lumped together with those carbohydrates which may not be refined. The several types of carbohydrates are added together for an overall carbohydrate total. Thus, the effect of the label is to hide the sugar content from the unwary buyer.”

Refined sugar manufacturers often twist the word ‘natural’ to mislead the public. Saying that something is made from “natural ingredients” creates the perception of a healthy, plant-based product. In reality, “natural” has become a marketing buzzword. Consider this example: apple and maple oatmeal. It sounds like a nutritious, vegetarian breakfast made from healthy, natural ingredients. However, a popular fast food chain has this item on the menu and it contains 31 grams of sugar — not too healthy.

Sugar: Toxic to Digestion

Much like pouring sugar into the gas tank of a car will gum up the engine, sugar has a negative effect on digestion and nutrient absorption.

“When starches and complex sugars (like those in honey and fruits) are digested, they break down into simple sugars called “monosaccharides”, which are usable substances-nutrients. When starches and sugars are taken together and undergo fermentation, they are broken down into carbon dioxide, acetic acid, alcohol, and water. With the exception of the water, all these are unusable substances—poisons. When proteins are digested, they are broken down into amino acids, which are usable substances-nutrients. When proteins are taken with sugar, they putrefy; they are broken down into a variety of ptomaines and leucomaines, which are nonusable substances-poisons. Enzymic digestion of foods prepares them for use by our body. Bacterial decomposition makes them unfit for use by our body. The first process gives us nutrients; the second gives us poisons.”

The bottom line? Refined sugar is one of the most toxic, least beneficial substances you can put into your body. If sugar, or its artificial substitutes, have a hold on your life, it’s time for a change. Sugar causes inflammation, which leads to all sorts of health problems, sugar is bad for your teeth, sugar slows digestion, sugar even has an effect on your brain. Stop drinking the nutrient-deficient soft drinks and start drinking life-supporting water. Stop consuming pre-packaged snacks loaded with refined sugar or dangerous artificial sweeteners and start consuming foods that don’t have a label. And, if you’re tired, weary, and need a boost, start cleansing your body!

Working with younger children in an early childhood education setting, you may only need an associate degree, but sometimes these positions do require a Bachelor’s degree. If you prefer to teach in a school, you will need to enroll in a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree program to meet your goals. In addition to a college degree, teachers also need certification or licensure from the state in which they wish to teach, which can sometimes be obtained while working on the degree or can be gotten after the degree coursework is complete. Another degree option is obtaining a Ph.D. to teach college or university level courses.

For a Bachelor’s degree online, you can expect to spend about 2 to 3 years on your studies and about 1 1/2 to 2 years for a Master’s program. Many programs also include the certification process as a part of their curriculum. If you want to teach elementary school, your studies will likely include a range of all subjects you will be teaching such as math, English, social studies, and science, as well as teaching theories, classroom management, and child development. Middle school and high school teachers will probably focus more intently on their subject of choice during their education rather than the wider range seen with elementary school teachers.

Teaching early childhood, elementary, middle school, and high school are not the only options for those interested in education. Special education, school administration, and reading specialists are among the other careers available for those working in the education and teaching fields. The field of education is a stable one with schools continuing to expand as the population continues to grow. Median salaries for regular education teachers is between $43,580 to $48,690 while special education teachers earn an average closer to $46,360."

By Arun Goel With the ever-increasing incidence of lifestyle diseases like cardio-vascular and nervous system disorders, the time has come for us to address this ourselves, fair and square WITHOUT external dependence. Did you know that reprogramming your natural breathing technique would not only help in preventing these problems but also help in the “reversal” of several such harmful conditions? Yes, it’s not only possible but proven too. In fact leading cardiac experts are advocating the benefits of “correct” breathing to their patients. Surprising as it is, almost none of us use the full capacity of our respiratory organs. This is aggravated by our sedentary lifestyles and leads to several complications popularly called - lifestyle disorders. The first question that comes to mind is – “How can I alter my natural breathing process?” Well, astonishing as it may seem, it’s true. By training our body to breathe in a particular fashion, we re-program our involuntary system to adopt this new way of breathing. This breathing technique is called the “Full Yogic breath” or simply Yoga breathing. Without wasting time, I’ll plunge right away into the technique followed by its overwhelming benefits. First, lie down on your back, relaxed, with hands and legs outstretched and eyes looking up at the roof. Gently close your eyes and relax. Step 1: Abdominal breathing Observe your natural breath. You will notice that as you inhale the abdomen rises and then falls with exhalation. Watch this for a few moments to check this flow. Now begin to deepen, lengthen and extend that movement. That is, while inhaling, let the abdomen rise to its limit and at exhalation let it fall completely. Keep the chest still during this entire process – only move the abdomen. Continue this for 20 breaths and then rest. Step 2: Thoracic (chest) breathing Again observe your normal breath, this time focusing your attention on the chest. You will notice the chest moving slightly up at inhalation and down with exhalation. Again observe this pattern for a few moments. Now again, begin to deepen, lengthen and extend that movement. This time, on inhalation expand and lift the rib cage, filling the lungs completely. Then on exhalation, let the lungs collapse fully, sinking to the limits. In this step, keep the abdomen still, moving only the chest. Do this for 20 breath cycles and then stop Step 3: Full Yogic breathing This combines the above 2 steps in the following way:

First inhale by filling the abdomen and then CONTINUE inhaling as you expand and fill the chest. Then exhale first from the chest as it empties and falls and then CONTINUE exhaling from the abdomen as it draws inwards completely. This is one round of the full yogic breath. Repeat this for 20 rounds. Remember the pattern… Inhaling - abdomen then chest; Exhaling – chest then abdomen. GOLDEN RULE: All of the above steps should be done WITHOUT strain. The natural tendency is to heave with effort. The right way is to make it smooth and effortless. Go slow and easy. Initially you will experience unevenness or bumps in this breathing process – as if there are 4 separate parts to the full yogic breath. This is natural considering the years we have spent breathing improperly. Instead, try to picture this breath as a continuous wave like pattern – as if the breath moves up from the navel to the throat with every inhalation and then, down from the throat to the navel with each exhalation. It may take a few weeks of practice to perfect a “SMOOTH flowing pattern with MINIMUM effort and with MAXIMUM capacity.”



This is the desired effect!! Over time, the yoga way of breathing will come naturally to you. And now for the all-important benefits… The full yogic breath is the basic building block of the powerful yoga breathing techniques, also called ‘Pranayama’ in Sanskrit, which are known for their multifarious benefits.



But the tangible benefits of the full yogic breath are that it: Releases acute and chronic muscular tensions around the heart and digestive organs.

Helps sufferers of respiratory illnesses such as asthma and emphysema to overcome the fear of shortness of breath. It actually increases lung capacity.

Encourages proper nervous stimulus to the cardio-vascular system

Dramatically reduces emotional and nervous anxiety

Improves detoxification through increased exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen

Amplifies the auto immune system by increased distribution of energy to the endocrine system

Calms the mind and integrates the mental / physical balance. And the real icing is that it contributes to both vitality and relaxation through this single practice. With such powerful all-round benefits, do you really need to be “motivated” to get going? Go ahead, and take charge of your life like never before. All the best,

The individual most likely used a USB drive to copy the information. The groundbreaking new analysis irrevocably destroys the Russian hacking narrative, and calls the actions of Crowdstrike and the DNC into question.

The document supplied to Disobedient Media via Adam Carter was authored by an individual known as The Forensicator. The full document referenced here has been published on their blog. Their analysis indicates the data was almost certainly not accessed initially by a remote hacker, much less one in Russia. If true, this analysis obliterates the Russian hacking narrative completely.

The Forensicator specifically discusses the data that was eventually published by Guccifer 2.0 under the title “NGP-VAN.” This should not be confused with the separate publication of the DNC emails by Wikileaks. This article focuses solely on evidence stemming from the files published by Guccifer 2.0, which were previously discussed in depth by Adam Carter.

Disobedient Media previously reported that Crowdstrike is the only group that has directly analyzed the DNC servers. Other groups including Threat Connect have used the information provided by Crowdstrike to claim that Russians hacked the DNC. However, their evaluation was based solely on information ultimately provided by Crowdstrike; this places the company in the unique position of being the only direct source of evidence that a hack occurred.

The group’s President Shawn Henry is a retired executive assistant director of the FBI while their co-founder and CTO, Dmitri Alperovitch, is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, which as we have reported, is linked to George Soros. Carter has stated on his website that “At present, it looks a LOT like Shawn Henry & Dmitri Alperovitch (CrowdStrike executives), working for either the HRC campaign or DNC leadership were very likely to have been behind the Guccifer 2.0 operation.” Carter’s website was described by Wikileaks as a useful source of primary information specifically regarding Guccifer 2.0.

Carter recently spoke to Disobedient Media, explaining that he had been contacted by The Forensicator, who had published a document which contained a detailed analysis of the data published by Guccifer 2.0 as “NGP-VAN.”

The document states that the files that eventually published as “NGP-VAN” by Guccifer 2.0 were first copied to a system located in the Eastern Time Zone, with this conclusion supported by the observation that “the .7z file times, after adjustment to East Coast time fall into the range of the file times in the .rar files.” This constitutes the first of a number of points of analysis which suggests that the information eventually published by the Guccifer 2.0 persona was not obtained by a Russian hacker.

The Forensicator stated in their analysis that a USB drive was most likely used to boot Linux OS onto a computer that either contained the alleged DNC files or had direct access to them. They also explained to us that in this situation one would simply plug a USB drive with the LinuxOS into a computer and reboot it; after restarting, the computer would boot from the USB drive and load Linux instead of its normal OS. A large amount of data would then be copied to this same USB drive.

In this case, additional files would have been copied en masse, to be “pruned” heavily at a later time when the 7zip archive now known as NGP-VAN was built. The Forensicator wrote that if 1.98 GB of data had been copied at a rate of 22.6 MB/s and time gaps t were noticed at the top level of the NGP-VAN 7zip file were attributed to additional file copying, then approximately 19.3 GB in total would have been copied. In this scenario, the 7zip archive (NGP-VAN) would represent only about 10% of the total amount of data that was collected.

The very small proportion of files eventually selected for use in the creation of the “NGP-VAN” files were later published by the creators of the Guccifer 2.0 persona. This point is especially significant, as it suggests the possibility that up to 90% of the information initially copied was never published.

The use of a USB drive would suggest that the person first accessing the data could not have been a Russian hacker. In this case, the person who copied the files must have physically interacted with a computer that had access to what Guccifer 2.0 called the DNC files. A less likely explanation for this data pattern where large time gaps were observed between top level files and directories

in the 7zip file, can be explained by the use of ‘think time’ to select and copy 1.9 GB of individual files, copied in small batches with think time interspersed. In either scenario, Linux would have been booted from a USB drive, which fundamentally necessitates physical access to a computer with the alleged DNC files.

The Forensicator believed that using the possible ‘think-time’ explanation to explain the time-gaps was a less likely explanation for the data pattern available, with a large amount of data most likely copied instantaneously, later “pruned” in the production of the Guccifer 2.0’s publication of the NGP-VAN files.

Both the most likely explanation and the less likely scenario provided by The Forensicator’s analysis virtually exclude the possibility of a Russian or remote hacker gaining external access to the files later published as “NGP-VAN.” In both cases, the physical presence of a person accessing a containing DNC information would be required.

Importantly, The Forensicator concluded that the chance that the files had been accessed and downloaded remotely over the internet were too small to give this idea any serious consideration. He explained that the calculated transfer speeds for the initial copy were much faster than can be supported by an internet connection. This is extremely significant and completely discredits allegations of Russian hacking made by both Guccifer 2.0 and Crowdstrike. This conclusion is further supported by analysis of the overall transfer rate of 23 MB/s. The Forensicator described this as “possible when copying over a LAN, but too fast to support the hypothetical scenario that the alleged DNC data was initially copied over the Internet (esp. to Romania).” Guccifer 2.0 had claimed to originate in Romania. So in other words, this rate indicates that the data was downloaded locally, possibly using the local DNC network. The importance of this finding in regards to destroying the Russian hacking narrative cannot be overstated. If the data is correct, then the files could not have been copied over a remote connection and so therefore cannot have been “hacked by Russia.” The use of a USB drive would also strongly suggest that the person copying the files had physical access to a computer most likely connected to the local DNC network. Indications that the individual used a USB drive to access the information over an internal connection, with time stamps placing the creation of the copies in the East Coast Time Zone, suggest that the individual responsible for initially copying what was eventually published by the Guccifer 2.0 persona under the title “NGP-VAN” was located in the Eastern United States, not Russia.

The implications of The Forensicator‘s analysis in combination with Adam Carter‘s work, suggest that at the very least, the Russian hacking narrative is patently false. Adam Carter has a strong grasp on the NGP-VAN files and Guccifer 2.0, with his website on the subject called a “good source” by Wikileaks via twitter. Carter told Disobedient Media that in his opinion the analysis provided by The Forensicator was accurate, but added that if changes are made to the work in future, any new conclusions would require further vetting.

On the heels of recent retractions by legacy media outlets like CNN and The New York Times, this could have serious consequences, if months of investigation into the matter by authorities are proven to have been based on gross misinformation based solely on the false word of Crowdstrike.

Assange recently lamented widespread ignorance about the DNC Leak via Twitter, specifically naming Hillary Clinton, the DNC, the Whitehouse and mainstream media as having “reason” to suppress the truth of the matter. As one of the only individuals who would have been aware of the source of the DNC Leaks, Assange’s statement corroborates a scenario where the DNC and parties described in Adam Carter’s work likely to have included Crowdstrike, may have participated in “suppressing knowledge” of the true origins and evidence surrounding the leak of the DNC emails by confusing them with the publication of the Guccifer 2.0 persona.

Despite Guccifer 2.0’s conflicting reports of having both been a Russian hacker and having contact with Seth Rich, the work of The Forensicator indicates that neither of these scenarios is likely true. What is suggested is that the files now known as “NGP-VAN” were copied by someone with access to a system connected to the DNC internal network, and that this action had no bearing on the files submitted to Wikileaks and were most likely unassociated with Seth Rich, and definitively not remotely “hacked” from Russia.

Kanye West has postponed upcoming concerts in Philadelphia and Detroit.

In the wake of wife Kim Kardashian West's robbery Sunday night in Paris, the Famous rapper has rescheduled Tuesday's Philadelphia show at Wells Fargo Center for Dec. 13, a Live Nation representative confirmed to USA TODAY. Thursday's Detroit concert at the Palace of Auburn Hills will now be held Dec. 22.

Ticketholders can use their original tickets on those dates.

West abruptly cut short his Sunday headlining set at The Meadows Music & Arts Festival in Queens, N.Y., when he was advised onstage of a ""family emergency."" Kardashian, who was in France for Paris Fashion Week, was robbed at gunpoint in a private residence by masked men, who made off with more than $10 million worth of jewelry. The reality TV mogul has since returned to New York.

The Saint Pablo tour will resume Friday in Chicago. The North American trek, which West launched this summer in support of album The Life of Pablo, will hit major cities across the Midwest and West Coast throughout October and November.

122,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-southchinasea-idUSKBN1572M4,newsbbc,China says will protect South China Sea sovereignty,"['Ben Blanchard', 'David Brunnstrom']","BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China said on Tuesday it had ""irrefutable"" sovereignty over disputed islands in the South China Sea after the White House vowed to defend ""international territories"" in the strategic waterway.

White House spokesman Sean Spicer in his comments on Monday signaled a sharp departure from years of cautious U.S. handling of China's assertive pursuit of territorial claims in Asia.

""The U.S. is going to make sure that we protect our interests there,"" Spicer said when asked if Trump agreed with comments by his secretary of state nominee, Rex Tillerson. On Jan. 11, Tillerson said China should not be allowed access to islands it has built in the contested South China Sea.

""It's a question of if those islands are in fact in international waters and not part of China proper, then yeah, we're going to make sure that we defend international territories from being taken over by one country,"" Spicer said.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular news briefing on Tuesday ""the United States is not a party to the South China Sea dispute"".

China claims most of the South China Sea, while Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Brunei claims parts of the sea that commands strategic sealanes and has rich fishing grounds along with oil and gas deposits.

China's sovereignty over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea was ""irrefutable"" Hua said. But China was also dedicated to protecting freedom of navigation and wants talks with nations directly involved to find a peaceful solution.

""We urge the United States to respect the facts, speak and act cautiously to avoid harming the peace and stability of the South China Sea,"" Hua said.

""Our actions in the South China Sea are reasonable and fair. No matter what changes happen in other countries, what they say or what they want to do, China's resolve to protect its sovereignty and maritime rights in the South China Sea will not change,"" she added.

Bar Access to Islands

Tillerson's remarks at his Senate confirmation hearing prompted Chinese state media to say at the time that the United States would need to ""wage war"" to bar China's access to the islands, where it has built military-length air strips and installed weapons systems.

Tillerson was asked at the hearing whether he supported a more aggressive posture toward China and said: ""We're going to have to send China a clear signal that, first, the island-building stops and, second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed.""

The former Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) chairman and chief executive did not elaborate on what might be done to deny China access to the islands.

But analysts said his comments, like those of Spicer, suggested the possibility of U.S. military action, or even a naval blockade. Such action would risk an armed confrontation with China, an increasingly formidable nuclear-armed military power. It is also the world's second-largest economy and the target of Trump accusations it is stealing American jobs.

Spicer declined to elaborate when asked how the United States could enforce such a move against China, except to say: ""I think, as we develop further, we'll have more information on it.""

Tillerson narrowly won approval from a Senate committee on Monday and is expected to win confirmation from the full Senate.

Risk of Dangerous Escalation

Military experts said that while the U.S. Navy has extensive capabilities in Asia to stage blockading operations with ships, submarines and planes, any such move against China's growing naval fleets would risk a dangerous escalation.

U.S. President Donald Trump signs an executive order on U.S. withdrawal from the Trans Pacific Partnership while flanked by Vice President Mike Pence (L) and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus (R) in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington January 23, 2017. Kevin Lamarque

Aides have said that Trump plans a major naval build-up in East Asia to counter China's rise.

China's foreign ministry said earlier this month it could not guess what Tillerson meant by his remarks, which came after Trump questioned Washington's longstanding and highly sensitive ""one-China"" policy over Taiwan.

Washington-based South China Sea expert Mira Rapp-Hooper at the Center for a New American Security called the threats to bar China's access in the South China Sea ""incredible"" and said it had no basis in international law.

""A blockade - which is what would be required to actually bar access - is an act of war,"" she added.

""The Trump administration has begun to draw red lines in Asia that they will almost certainly not be able to uphold, but they may nonetheless be very destabilizing to the relationship with China, invite crises, and convince the rest of the world that the United States is an unreliable partner.""

Bonnie Glaser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank called Spicer's remarks ""worrisome"" and said the new administration was ""sending confusing and conflicting messages.""

Dean Cheng, a China expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Spicer's remarks showed the South China Sea was an important issue for the Trump administration.

He said it was significant that neither Spicer nor Tillerson had been specific as to what actions would be taken and this left open the possibility that economic measures - instead of military steps - could be used against China and firms that carry out island building.

To ease the family’s financial burden, a GoFundMe campaign was set up. Incredibly, $325,000 was raised in just one week!

Casualties in war are inevitable. However, coping with the absence of an individual after they’ve passed never gets easier. Fortunately for the family of Special Forces Sergeant Mark De Alencar, kind people from all around the globe have reached out to honor the military member who was killed while fighting ISIS and in doing so, have greatly alleviated the financial burden the family faces.

GoodNewsNetwork reports that last weekend, Alencar was killed while fighting in Afghanistan. During his time as a Green Beret, he was recognized with over 19 awards and badges, including the Purple Heart, the Iraq Campaign Medal with two stars, Expert Infantryman Badge, and others. He leaves behind a wife and five children.

To honor the fallen soldier, a close friend named Nikki Damron created a GoFundMe campaign to ease the grieving family’s financial burdens. The initial goal was set at $15,000, but incredibly, it raised over $200,000 in one night. One week later, it surpassed $325,000.

On the campaign page, Nikki wrote:

“Mark was a close friend of my husbands and my family, a hard working soldier and more importantly, an amazing father. Our community has been hit hard in the last passing months and I just felt the need to try and do my part and help out his family. “Joining SF was a huge dream of Marks, one he worked very hard to achieve. As a fellow military wife, I feel it is my duty to make every effort to ensure his wife and family are taken care of,” she added.

War easily paints the world as a terrifying, grim place to live. Fortunately, stories are frequently offered to remind one that plenty of positive happenings occur on this planet, as well. Please share this news and comment your thoughts below!

McCain said on Wednesday Russia’s alleged cyberattacks against US political organizations to influence the 2016 presidential election amount to an “act of war.”

""It's an act of war,"" McCain, a staunch opponent of Russia, told reporters on the US Capitol in Washington, DC.

""If you try to destroy the fundamentals of democracy, then you have destroyed a nation,” said McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

""I'm not saying it's an atomic attack. I'm just saying that when you attack a nation's fundamental structure, which they are doing, then it's an act of war,” he continued.

McCain also accused Moscow of committing an ""act of war"" against the United States last week, and demanded stronger sanctions against Russia over the hacking, which the US intelligence community claims amounted to meddling in the US election.

McCain has been a virulent critic of Russia and President-elect Donald Trump, who has repeatedly cast doubt over the claim that Russia launched cyberattacks on the US.

On Thursday, the Senate Armed Services Committee, led by McCain, is to hold the first public hearing in Congress on the alleged hacking.

McCain and other top congressional leaders have pledged to press legislation on sanctions against Russia in addition to those announced by President Barack Obama last month.

On December 22, Obama announced a series of economic sanctions against Russia, as well as expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats, over allegations that it interfered in the 2016 presidential election through cyberattacks.

McCain has criticized the sanctions as insufficient and overdue.

However, Trump, the incoming US president, has repeatedly questioned the accuracy of US intelligence pointing to Russia’s responsibility for the hacks and has said it was time to ""move on.""

The US claim has been rejected by Moscow. Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, which published the stolen emails, has also denied that the Russian government provided the files."

The undercover station was in 7 World Trade Center, a smaller office tower that fell several hours after the collapse of the twin towers on Sept. 11, a U.S. government official said.

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that immediately after the attack, a special CIA team scoured the rubble in search of secret documents and intelligence reports stored in the station, either on paper or in computers. It was not known whether the efforts were successful.

A CIA spokesman declined to comment on the existence of the office, which was first reported in Sunday's editions of The New York Times.

The New York station was behind the false front of another federal organization, which the Times did not identify. The station was a base of operations to spy on and recruit foreign diplomats stationed at the United Nations, while debriefing selected American business executives and others willing to talk to the CIA after returning from overseas.

The agency's officers in New York often work undercover, posing as diplomats and business executives, among other things. They have been deeply involved in counter-terrorism efforts in the New York area, working jointly with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies.

The CIA's main New York office was unaffected by the attacks, but agents have been sharing space at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, and have borrowed other federal government offices in the city.

The agency is prohibited from conducting domestic espionage operations against Americans, but it maintains stations in a number of major United States cities, where CIA case officers try to meet and recruit students and other foreigners to return to their countries and spy for the United States.

The New York station was believed to have been the largest and most important CIA domestic station outside the Washington area.

Description:



It is said that the late-80s sports hero Bo Jackson was the last of the legends that people actually got to tell each other about, as opposed to just saying, here, watch a clip. The internet - and the instant mass distribution of almost any eye-catching video - has changed the world to the point where almost everything is recorded. But why lament times gone by? Let's enjoy our newfound viral-videotaped universe. Here are 5 moments recently captured on video that you have to see to believe. Let's begin!



#5 First monster truck front flip

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqUlSw1uqaw



Ever watched BMX and wondered how they do a front flip on a bike? Seems challenging enough. How about a car? Wow, that's impressive. But earlier this year, driver Lee O' Donnell upped the ante even farther - with an incredible front flip in a gigantic racing truck. Yes, that's a front flip by a monster truck, a 10, 000 pound gorilla of a truck that can crush whole cars. Known as the Mad Scientist and the world's most gifted racer, O' Donnell has spent 20 years wowing audiences at truck and tractor pulls across the USA. But this incredible flip made history and wrote his name in the record books.



#4 Streamer Receives Donation from Player, Immediately Plays Against Them

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLJcGGKVQOs&feature=youtu.be



Whether it’s a paycheck, found in our pant pockets or in the clothes dryer, money makes people happy whenever they see it. Enter Thijs, one of the most famous Hearthstone players on social media. During gameplay, he received a $30 donation from a friend of his, Kolento. Thijs continued to roll video and clicked to enter another fight in the game. But in one of the funniest coincidences in recent gaming history, the player chosen as his opponent was none other than he who had just donated the money, Kolento.



#3 Guy Hits Two Cars, Flies and Lives

https://www.reddit.com/r/nevertellmetheodds/comments/64n17l/after_this_and_alive/



Some people just won't die. We don't know if they're lucky, hardy or just immortal, but they seem to be guarded by the Gods. On the footage you can see this anonymous man driving a motorcycle very fast. He smashes into a car, flies into the air and lands on another motorist's wind shield. Amazingly, he gets up as if nothing happened at all. One YouTuber suggested that he must be made out of rubber. Another sagely pointed out that the company who made his helmet just got a new voucher, and possibly a new commercial ad.



#2 Insane Basketball Trick Shot

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1Lpl_tVwEM



Many home-grown sports feat videos are clearly manipulated and set up in advance. Or, they person simply tried 100 times and recorded every one until getting the viral video clip they were after. But this man's trick basketball shot seems too astronomically difficult for either of those scenarios to be the case.Lounging on camera and drinking a beer, the man tosses the basketball behind him and is shocked when it bounds off the goal, off the roof of the house, and then finally into the net for a perfect switch. Look at his reaction - that doesn't seem like a doctored video stunt.



#1 Dad Shared Child Abuse With Youtube

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOVrrL5KtsM



In one of the darkest hours in the history of YouTube, a man physically abused his family and filmed the mistreatment to upload on YouTube. First, the father made his children fight and bully one another, with the larger of two boys giving a harsh beating to his other son. Then, bizarrely, he asked his wife to kick HIS butt while the cameras rolled - satisfyingly, she did. But he didn't stop there, eventually smashing their belongings and pulling a real gun on the poor helpless tots. Because there is a merciful God in heaven, YouTube discovered and banned the user, and the sick, demented man mumbled an apology to users in this video before hopefully disappearing from the planet.

At least 8 people are dead two of which are confirmed to be “small children.” An additional 28 people are reported to be in “serious condition.”

The San Antonio Fire Department responded to a call shortly after 12:30 AM. The caller described it as dozens of people locked inside of a trailer. The trailer was apparently abandoned, and later it was discovered the driver was still at the scene.

Authorities suspect this was an illegal human smuggling operation gone very wrong.

A total of 29 Fire department units mostly ambulances responded. A spokesperson from the San Antonio Fire Department tells us this was handled like any other “mass casualty incident.” Two Emergency Medical Helicopters, known as AirLIFE, were also dispatched to retrieve victims who were in the worst shape.

166,https://nationonenews.com/2017/07/22/stein-recount-questions.html,nationonenews,"Jill Steins still has $1,361,834.20 in the bank.",[],"Right after Trump won the election Jill Stein capitalized on the disappointment of Democrats. She collected over seven million dollars to pay for her “recounts.”

Once the dust settled and it was clear that Donald Trump was the winner Stein released a statement to the Press. In that statement, she said what remained after the recount would go to charity.

According to the most recent Federal Election Commission filing, Jill Stein still has $1,361,834.20 in the bank.

President Trump was critical of the Green Party recount effort. He mentioned this on several occasions while the recount was going on. He later Tweeted referring to the recount as a “Stein scam to raise money.”

The Green Party just dropped its recount suit in Pennsylvania and is losing votes in Wisconsin recount. Just a Stein scam to raise money! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016

It appears President Trump may have been right all along. The efforts to “scam” Democrats don’t seem to end there. Just yesterday Jill Stein sent a cryptic tweet.

She appears to be trying to gain support from former Bernie supporters, and from Trump supporters when she said:

“I didn’t sabotage Bernie” and ” ludicrous Russia conspiracy theories”

Unlike the Dems, I didn't sabotage Bernie Sanders in the primaries, then try to cover my tracks with ludicrous Russia conspiracy theories. — Dr. Jill Stein🌻 (@DrJillStein) July 21, 2017

It remains unclear what Jill Stein is up to. One thing is very clear. She promised to donate the funds left over from the recount to charity, but, seven months laters, she still has over $1,300,000.00 on hand.

Democrats and Republicans alike have good reason to question Dr. Jill Stein. We attempted to contact Stein and her campaign several times in the last two weeks but received no response.

Following her cryptic Tweet aimed at a broad audience, we determined it was important for all Americans that we publish this today.

She won’t answer our requests for information about the money, so, maybe she will respond to a few million Americans. You know what to do."

Leaks of Classified information are dangerous because they expose our countries security capabilities to other countries. They are hard to defend against because the government cannot acknowledge or deny the claims because it will expose our countries security capabilities to other countries.

Classified information is showing up in the paper way too much. President Trump is changing his tactics. Earlier today President Trump took his proverbial boxing gloves off.

In a bare fisted right hook, President Trump just knocked the Washington Post to the proverbial ground. He is clearly, done with the nonsense.

Most people don’t make the connection between Amazon and the Washington Post. Today President Trump just put the founder of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post on notice.

Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post and Amazon. Some have speculated that Jeff Bezos purchased the Washington Post in order to support Hillary Clinton. The paper was out of money and Bezos picked it up cheap.

It is likely that the Washington Post is dependant on the constant influx of cash from Amazon. Without Amazon and their online sales, the Washington Post will be right back where it was when Bezos bought it, BROKE!

A new INTELLIGENCE LEAK from the Amazon Washington Post,this time against A.G. Jeff Sessions.These illegal leaks, like Comey's, must stop! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 22, 2017

Trump’s Tweet just made an unforgettable mental connection between Amazon and the Washington Post. I wonder how long the Washington Post can last if Trump Supporters decided to stop shopping with Amazon? It wouldn’t be the first time.

“Bad Ideas survive in our society by going unchallenged”- Dr. Mike Adams

On Monday evening, March 6th Mike Adams, Ph.D. Professor of Criminology at UNC-W spoke to about 100 people at the UNC Student Union about Free Speech. Speaking about his experiences and his victories, Dr. Adams received enthusiasm.

Sam Cullier, an Economics student at UNC, wanted other students to know that there are plenty of students who feel as he does about Freedom of Speech, and he was anticipating a good speech from Dr. Adams, who he feels is a “Fantastic guy.” “I have seen many of his Social Media Posts on the topics of Political Correctness,” Sam told me. “I think that Political Correctness is like a Cancer on Campus,” he went on. “I think other students are willing to sacrifice the truth to preserve a Political Ideology,” he told me. And that bothers him.

Currently, Sam doesn’t do much on the topic of Free Speech, other than post on Social Media about it to his friends.

Dr. Adams encouraged the attendees to start Freedom of Speech Clubs wherever they could, giving them examples of how to make a lasting impact on the movement.

FREE SPEECH IS SEXY!

Readers may recognize the name. Professor Adams made this topic of Campus Reform hot before anyone else in the movement knew what Sexy was! Mike has given 94 speeches on the Topic of Freedom of Speech over the years. He may be an originator of Guerilla Theater for College Republicans.

Back in 2005 Professor Adams had made a name for himself as written about in this article with the Canadian Free Press

A FOUNDING FATHER IN THE MOVEMENT!

Mike Adams may be the Orginal Milo, in fact, having been escorted off two college Campuses, after offending “snowflakes,” himself. Dr. Adams told me that he isn’t afraid of facing violent opposition to his speeches because he demands that the Police do their job and protect his speech. He is very confident and unafraid.

In attendance were 7-8 local police to keep the order, if needed. Mike is no stranger to offending people, AND he speaks out loudly to encourage others to challenge Campus “Speech Codes.”

Dr. Adams has been actively involved in a few high-profile, Campus Free Speech cases. In fact, appearing on Fox News numerous times on the topic. He once was in a debate with a Porn Star, on MSNBC. Here is a great article on Dr. Adam’s background. As you can see this guy is down for the cause of Free Speech.

“We have kicked their Asses on lawsuits, so they find new ways to suppress Free Speech”

Dr. Adams will be consulting with Lt. Governor Dan Forest on Free Speech Policy in North Carolina, under The Restore Campus Free Speech Act. He will be speaking again tomorrow, at an event for iCON, Issues Confronting Our Nation at 7:00 PM at 200 S. Elliott Rd. Chapel Hill, NC.

We have it on good authority that the cookies served tonight at the Student Union, were in case any snowflakes showed up. Tomorrow night we may all be on our own for snacks- and coloring books."

You may remember planking where a person would try to look like a board on top of some object. This challenge requires more than a single person with strong abs.

It reminds me of an extreme version of the “quiet game”. This High School just raised the bar on this challenge. I have to admit, this will be a fun challenge to watch over the next few weeks! This might just get interesting.

A High School in North Richland Hills, Texas, took the Mannequin Challenge to a whole new level today. It seems they had a Pep-Rally. The entire gymnasium full of students participated in the Mannequin Challenge. The Official Richland High School YouTube Account shared a video.

No, this video below is not computer generated graphics. This is an entire High School, over 1000 young adults standing still and silent. That is about as extreme as it gets.

About the only thing that could beat this is Jerry Jones getting his fans to participate in this challenge at a Cowboys Game! —Where you at Jerry Jones – Dallas Cowboys?!?

If you have any doubts about how EXTREME this really is, just ask any High School teacher how difficult it is to get a room full of High School students to be quite. This is just about a Extreme as it gets…

As the President arrives at Marine One he reached down and picked up the Lance Corporal’s “Cover”.

The Navy and Marines call their hats “covers.” That was awesome in itself, but the real story was missed by everyone.

As you watch the video look at how many people near the President are armed.

That young Lance Corporal, who lost his cover, is armed with a Baretta M9 9mm pistol. When you look at his chest he has two marksmanship medals. The one on the left shows his rifle proficiency the smaller one on the right his pistol skills.

He is an Expert Rifleman and an Expert with a Pistol. Achieving “Expert” status with a pistol in very difficult.

You will also notice the Presidential Seal on the Marine’s right pocket. This Marine has earned his place amoung the Presidential Guard. He has a Military Occupational Specialty of 8152.

Marines who have earned the 8152 designations are called “Gun-Slingers” by the rest of the Marine Corp. They are the very elite in small arms. What does that mean? Gunslingers have extensive training in small arms and they are VERY, VERY FAST and DEADLY ACCURATE!

Sure, most Marines can shoot and do it very well, but this Marine can pull his pistol from the holster and hit a target 30 feet away, three times, in less than half a second. Why does that matter?

How many times did you see Obama that close to a US Marine “Gun Slinger,” let alone be brave enough to try to put his hat back on!"

At least he isn’t the kind of person who would go off and do something outrageous. His response to the news that ABC was cutting his show was much more subtle, but none the less a powerful message.

ABC News announced they were cutting Tim Allen’s show “The Last Man Standing.” The announcement to cancel the third most watched comedy show in the history of ABC was a shock to loyal viewers. Frustration and surprise followed the announcement.

Tim Allen didn’t make much of a fuss about it. He just moved on. Although he did use his Twitter account to express his sadness over the show being canceled.

Stunned and blindsided by the network I called home for the last six years. #lastmanstanding — Tim Allen (@ofctimallen) May 16, 2017

Today rumors began to swirl that “Last Man Standing” may continue after all. Sources inside Fox suggest the show will move to Fox and its affiliates along with “certain streaming services.” The show is actually owned by 20th Century Fox, a subsidiary of Fox Entertainment Group a.k.a Fox, not ABC.

ABC has canceled the show, but since it is owned by Fox, Fox can just move it. We are told that negotiations are under way with Fox and their affiliates to find a time for the show on their network. The Official Announcement to come within the next month.

Update Added: 5/23/2017

According to Deadline, the Parent TV Council has now Officially recommended that Fox replaces “The Mick” with “Last Man Standing,” saying:

“it’s a much safer show for families than The Mick and, for that matter, much safer than most programs on air on primetime broadcast television.”

ABC has angered Conservatives by canceling the show. Tim Allen was the clear victim of an attack on Conservatives which will further hurt ABCs bottom line. It looks like the Last Man Standing will be Tim Allen, at a new time and place with Fox.

After you share this, check out this message that Trump has for supporters, you won’t hear about this from the Mainstream Media! ==> ABC and WaPo buried the truth, but Trump dug it up for all to see!"

Under Oath, James Comey admitted he provided information to a friend so it could be leaked to the media.

Breaking News

According to The Hill, those documents contained classified information. In a Sunday afternoon article The Hills says:

“Four of the memos had markings making clear they contained information classified at the secret or confidential level, according to officials directly familiar with the matter.”

Media SPIN

Several Main Stream Media outlets have begun to twist the story. All of them have been unable to avoid the truth. Even adversarial Politico admitted the information was leaked and it is classified. Of course “their sources” tell them it was “retroactively” classified. They provided no details of when or by whom the alleged “retroactive” action was taken. Finally, Politico was forced to admit:

At least one of Comey’s memos remains unclassified, the source with knowledge told POLITICO.

In other words, all of the memos, except for one are CLASSIFIED.

President Trump Responds

Early Monday morning President Trump shared his concerns about James Comey’s actions Tweeting:

“James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media. That is so illegal!”

James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media. That is so illegal! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 10, 2017

James Comey has not been seen publically in several weeks leaving some to wonder if he has gone into hiding alongside his co-conspirator Daniel Richman. Richman has been reported to be “in hiding” for several weeks after his involvement in the leaking scandal was revealed by the NY Post."

Sure, most Marines can shoot and do it very well, but this Marine can pull his pistol from the holster and hit a target 30 feet away, three times, in less than half a second. Why does that matter?

How many times did you see Obama that close to a US Marine “Gun Slinger,” let alone be brave enough to try to put his hat back on!"

She collected over seven million dollars to pay for her “recounts.”

Once the dust settled and it was clear that Donald Trump was the winner Stein released a statement to the Press. In that statement, she said what remained after the recount would go to charity.

According to the most recent Federal Election Commission filing, Jill Stein still has $1,361,834.20 in the bank.

President Trump was critical of the Green Party recount effort. He mentioned this on several occasions while the recount was going on. He later Tweeted referring to the recount as a “Stein scam to raise money.”

The Green Party just dropped its recount suit in Pennsylvania and is losing votes in Wisconsin recount. Just a Stein scam to raise money! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016

It appears President Trump may have been right all along. The efforts to “scam” Democrats don’t seem to end there. Just yesterday Jill Stein sent a cryptic tweet.

She appears to be trying to gain support from former Bernie supporters, and from Trump supporters when she said:

“I didn’t sabotage Bernie” and ” ludicrous Russia conspiracy theories”

Unlike the Dems, I didn't sabotage Bernie Sanders in the primaries, then try to cover my tracks with ludicrous Russia conspiracy theories. — Dr. Jill Stein🌻 (@DrJillStein) July 21, 2017

It remains unclear what Jill Stein is up to. One thing is very clear. She promised to donate the funds left over from the recount to charity, but, seven months laters, she still has over $1,300,000.00 on hand.

Democrats and Republicans alike have good reason to question Dr. Jill Stein. We attempted to contact Stein and her campaign several times in the last two weeks but received no response.

Following her cryptic Tweet aimed at a broad audience, we determined it was important for all Americans that we publish this today.

She won’t answer our requests for information about the money, so, maybe she will respond to a few million Americans. You know what to do."

CNN’s Jim Acosta continues to attack President Trump every chance he gets. Most of the time it results in Fake News. Today was no different!

Earlier this morning Jim Acosta sent out a Tweet, directed at President Trump. In that Tweet, he accused the President of “finally” holding a press conference overseas. He ignored the fact that this only President Trump’s second trip abroad. Then he starts his typical whining about being called “fake news.”

Trump finally held a news conference overseas. But he took a question from a friendly reporter and then attacked CNN as ""fake news."" — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) July 6, 2017

Everyone knows about Jim Acosta’s showboating and his attacks on the President. Do you remember the time he was rude and interrupted Donald Trump? Who can forget, right!?! Donald Trump made it clear back then that he thinks CNN is “fake news.”

The attacks from this CNN Reporter haven’t stopped. After Jim Acosta’s inflammatory Tweet this morning, he took it a step further. He implied that President Trump was holding a “fake news conference” because CNN was not given an opportunity to ask a question.

I believe that when it comes to women and work, there isn’t one right answer. The only person who can create a life you’ll love is you.- IVANKA TRUMP

By almost any definition Ivanka Trump is a successful woman. She is an author and businesswoman. The 35-year-old graduate of the University of Pennsylvania is married to Jared Kushner, a real estate executive who owns the New York Observer, who serves as a White House senior advisor in the new administration.

Aside from her husband’s wealth, Ivanka has an estimated personal net worth of $150,000,000! Yet she is one of the liberal media’s favorite targets.

The daughter of the president, graduated from the Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania, cum laude, meaning “with honor”, which typically means she finished within the top 25 to 30 percent of her class, with a bachelor’s degree in economics in 2004.

Ivanka appeared on the cover of Seventeen magazine in 1997, has walked the fashion runways for Versace, and is bilingual, speaking English and French fluently, yet she is often criticized in the media when given the slightest opportunity.

Whether working as a television personality or fashion model, Ivanka has always lived her adult life in the public eye. During the presidential campaign, she campaigned and gave speeches and interviews. She did this while raising three children

Political opponents often use criticism of Ivanka’s clothing brand, as a way to make a statement as to how they feel about her dad. As of February 2017, department store chains Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom dropped Trump’s fashion line, citing “poor performance.”

Yet, in reality, the clothing line is reporting it achieved record sales numbers in the month of February.

“Since the beginning of February, they were some of the best performing weeks in the history of the brand,” Abigail Klem, the president of the Ivanka Trump fashion brand reported on Wednesday, according to The Hill.

She is very proud of her father, President Donald Trump.

I am so proud of my daughter Ivanka. To be abused and treated so badly by the media, and to still hold her head so high, is truly wonderful! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 11, 2017

“One of my father’s greatest talents is the ability to see the potential in people”, and she said, “he will make America great again.”

“Women Who Work” will be the second book by Ivanka Trump and has a release date of May 2, 2017.

I am certain President Trump is proud of his daughter’s accomplishments. We all should hope to do so well."

Major media outlets are losing viewers to more contemporary sources like Breitbart or WND. Other sites like ours have thrived in this new world where a small paper can grow by simply telling the truth. It would seem the days of “broadcast” messaging by the establishment are numbered.

Obama is aware of the trend and is now calling it the “wild, wild west.” He claims that wild conspiracy theories run rampant on the Internet. What he really means is, he and others like him cannot control a truly FREE PRESS! That is what we are. We are FREE from the influences of political powers. We are FREE to publish what we choose. We are FREE to expose facts without fear of losing our empire.

In a speech given at the University of Pittsburg Obama says”:

“We are going to have to rebuild within this wild-wild-west-of-information flow some sort of curating function that people agree to .. …There has to be, I think, some sort of way in which we can sort through information that passes some basic truthiness tests and those that we have to discard because they just don’t have any basis in anything that’s actually happening in the world,”

Censorship

Notice the subtle word; he wants to “curate,” in other words; he wants to censor free speech. He even goes on to say that it is not censorship. He wants a place where people can go to see if something is reliable as if people cannot think for themselves.

In other words, he wants to control the PRESS. Over the past four decades, we have seen Civil rights taken by the courts. The one thing the courts has never touched in the Freedom of the Press.

This might be because the Establishment controlled the press. BUT, not anymore! If there is one thing mightier than an AR-15, it’s my KEYBOARD and my relationship with many FREE PRESS publishers who won’t “CURATE” the news!"

“Four of the memos had markings making clear they contained information classified at the secret or confidential level, according to officials directly familiar with the matter.”

Media SPIN

Several Main Stream Media outlets have begun to twist the story. All of them have been unable to avoid the truth. Even adversarial Politico admitted the information was leaked and it is classified. Of course “their sources” tell them it was “retroactively” classified. They provided no details of when or by whom the alleged “retroactive” action was taken. Finally, Politico was forced to admit:

At least one of Comey’s memos remains unclassified, the source with knowledge told POLITICO.

In other words, all of the memos, except for one are CLASSIFIED.

President Trump Responds

Early Monday morning President Trump shared his concerns about James Comey’s actions Tweeting:

“James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media. That is so illegal!”

BREAKING: We've got Trump tax returns. Tonight, 9pm ET. MSNBC. (Seriously). — Rachel Maddow MSNBC (@maddow) March 14, 2017

Half an hour into her show, she dropped the bombshell.

Maddow produced two pages from Donald Trump’s 2005 tax returns . . . thereby proving to the world that then businessman Donald Trump — wait for it — paid his taxes!!!

In fact, he paid a fortune in taxes — $38 million on $150 million of income.

Thank you Rachel Maddow for proving to your #Trump hating followers how successful @realDonaldTrump is & that he paid $40mm in taxes! #Taxes — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 15, 2017

Doing the math, Donald Trump paid about 25% of his earned income in taxes.

Trump paid more in taxes than Rachel Maddow’s boss, MSNBC Comcast, which paid only 24% in taxes on average over the last five years.

Former president Obama’s tax rate for 2015 was only 18.7%.

Mitt Romey’s 2011 tax rate was 14%.

And Socialist Bernie Sanders paid only a 13.5% percent tax rate in 2014.

Even Maddow’s big tease went flat because twenty minutes before she went on air, the White House released this statement:

You know you are desperate for ratings when you are willing to violate the law to push a story about two pages of tax returns from over a decade ago. Before being elected President, Mr. Trump was one of the most successful businessmen in the world with a responsibility to his company, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required. That being said, Mr. Trump paid $38 million dollars even after taking into account large scale depreciation for construction, on an income of more than $150 million dollars, as well as paying tens of millions of dollars in other taxes such as sales and excise taxes and employment taxes and this illegally published return proves just that. Despite this substantial income figure and tax paid, it is totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns. The dishonest media can continue to make this part of their agenda, while the President will focus on his, which includes tax reform that will benefit all Americans.

It was such an epic fail that even The Hollywood Reporter mocked Maddow.

Rachel Maddow may just have helped Donald Trump win reelection in 2020."

Trump Distances the United States from the Climate Change Scam

Climate change is a serious problem throughout the world. Developing nations dump large amounts of waste into our atmosphere while countries like the United States are held back by restrictions. Those restrictions don’t apply to the worst abusers.

President Trump was conveniently distanced from the worst environmental offenders. He seems to have made it a point to ensure that he wasn’t near the Globalist Elite when the photo was taken. He appeared to start a brief conversation with the Joko Widodo, President of Indonesia right before the photo was taken.

Several Main Stream Media outlets reported that Trump was unable to “shove his way” to the center of the stage. The reports are completely dishonest because President Trump knew exactly where to stand and he never moved. There are a lot of videos on Youtube claiming he tried to steal the spotlight.

The Telegraph created a video showing the moments leading up to the photo. It appears France’s Macron was the person who was trying to steal the spotlight or was Macron just secretly making sure Trump was distanced from the group? Have a look for yourself…

Finally, sources close to the Whitehouse told Nation One News that President Trump was aware of his position in the photo weeks in advance. Another source close to the President recounted part of an internal Whitehouse G-20 planning meeting where Trump said:

“This is great, great news! That picture will show Americans that I am not part of the Globalist crowd hurting America. I might big Big League, but I am not part of that crowd! Americans will understand that I am putting America First! I trust the American people because they trusted me!”

Overall President Trump drew a great deal of criticism about his stance on Climate Change. This was a huge success for Americans who believe that Climate Change is just another way for Globalists to steal American Jobs and strip America of her wealth.

Yes, you read that correctly. The government is adding more rules making it easier for predatory businesses to take advantage of High School graduates. Somehow they believe this will improve the dropout rate.

Beginning in 2020 Students must show they have something to do after High School. They can get a job, join the military, be accepted to college, or join a “gap year” program.

On this surface, this may seem like a good idea. A closer look at numbers tells a different story.

Chicago High School Graduates – New Jobs

In 2016 the Chicago school system announced a record breaking 20,438 graduates. Chicago added 34,400 new jobs in 2016. Sounds great right? NO!

Of the 34,400 jobs created only 7,500 of those jobs were available to High School graduates and even less to inexperienced High School graduates. That leaves the military, college or gap year programs.

The military recruits an average of 100,000 new members each year. That is an average of about 2,000 per state. Of course, some states are higher than others and we do not have access to that information. So, let’s assume that Chicago gets double the national average at 4,000.

So far, we have reached 11,500, which leaves about 9,000 students to college or gap year programs. The national average for college attendance between the ages of 18 and 24 is 33.6%. So this will account for another 6,900.

Chicago will be left with about 2,100 students attending gap year programs… Which leaves just one question.

How much does Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Barack Obama stand to gain from investments into Gap Year Programs?

Here is an idea Mr. Mayor. Bring more jobs to your city and stop creating new industries with your Crony Capitalist laws… Oh wait, but then how would you take advantage of the working poor???"

Judy O’Connor attended every class with 29-year-old Marty O’Connor, taking notes for him as he worked toward his master’s of business administration degree at Chapman University. Shortly after pushing Marty in his wheelchair across the stage, Judy was called out as a “special individual.” The crowd cheered.

The next four days could perhaps be the beginning of a return to the simple American idea of cooperation and common ground. Freedom Fest is based on one common theme. Working together to solve America’s problems.

Freedom Fest

Freedom Fest is all about respect, discussion, debate, reason, logic, leverage, and problem-solving. Nation One News is known for our entertaining and honest coverage and support of President Donald Trump. We make no apologies for sharing the truth and we look forward to bringing you honest coverage of Freedom Fest 2017.

Over the next four days, we are joining forces with online media. We will deliver in-depth and behind the scenes coverage of this important meeting of minds. To many, it looks like America is being ripped apart by a destructive political storm. Appearances can be deceiving. Amid the political storm, a calm center has formed.

President Trump

Slowly, but surely, President Trump is closing the gap between political extremes in America. Our country is staring down a double barrel crisis. On one side we have extremists who take to the streets destroying property, endangering lives, and towing the socialist line. On the other, extremists threaten to devalue President Trump’s work with their racist worldview and disruptive and unethical demeanor.

The far left and the far right can’t seem to reconcile their differences. Both sides use Trump to promote their causes. The far-left mouthpieces spew fake news, while the far-right damage the reputation of real journalism. In the middle of the storm, you can find the people who will always do what is right for America no matter what.

The Eye of the Storm

The eye of this political storm is growing in size. More and more Americans are seeking the safety, security, and CALM of historical American values. Meaningful discussion and debate about important American issues are happening despite this extremism. As you read this some of the smartest and brightest minds in the country converge on Las Vegas, Nevada. We are here.

You may not hear much about this from the Main Stream Media, but you can count on us to give you a blow by blow account of the hard work that will go down at Freedom Fest 2017.

So far we have counted three “Make America Great Again Hats,” and there are only about 150 people here… This is gonna be GREAT!

In the wake of endless articles about “rumors” from “sources,” the truth came out in the early afternoon hours of Friday, July 21, 2017. Sean Spicer is has resigned as the White Press Secretary, BUT despite several incorrect reports, Anthony Scaramucci is not replacing him.

We have seen no evidence that this change in staff is in any way a scandal, which is a distortion by the Main Stream Media. Several news organizations are screaming “Scandal, Scandal, Scandal.” For example, CNBC released the news with a salacious title that reads “Sean Spicer resigns as White House press secretary after objecting to Scaramucci hire.”

The fact is that Sean Spicer resigned, he was not fired, and he will appear on Fox’s Hannity alongside Scaramucci tonight. Anthony Scaramucci is ACTUALLY REPLACING Michael Dubke who resigned on June 2, 2017. Sean Spicer is being backfilled by Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

Through history, the Whitehouse Press Secretary and Communications Directors don’t last very long. Since Ronald Reagan took office we have seen twelve Press Secretaries and five Presidents. Bill Clinton burned through five all by himself.

Communications Directors are even more likely to have short terms. From Reagan to Obama we saw twenty-three different people walk through the revolving door. As some people at CNN might say, this is:

In May 2013 “Gay” youth were allowed into the Boy Scouts. Later that year the Supreme Court changed the meaning of the word Marriage to include gays.

Some have argued the attack on the Boy Scouts was directly related to pending Supreme Court cases. If only they could get the Boy Scouts to cave, they could get the Supreme Court to give in to the idea that people of the same sex can somehow procreate…

In 2015 the Boy Scouts opened the door wide to Sex and Politics when they allowed Gay Adults.

Trump Distances the United States from the Climate Change Scam

Climate change is a serious problem throughout the world. Developing nations dump large amounts of waste into our atmosphere while countries like the United States are held back by restrictions. Those restrictions don’t apply to the worst abusers.

President Trump was conveniently distanced from the worst environmental offenders. He seems to have made it a point to ensure that he wasn’t near the Globalist Elite when the photo was taken. He appeared to start a brief conversation with the Joko Widodo, President of Indonesia right before the photo was taken.

Several Main Stream Media outlets reported that Trump was unable to “shove his way” to the center of the stage. The reports are completely dishonest because President Trump knew exactly where to stand and he never moved. There are a lot of videos on Youtube claiming he tried to steal the spotlight.

The Telegraph created a video showing the moments leading up to the photo. It appears France’s Macron was the person who was trying to steal the spotlight or was Macron just secretly making sure Trump was distanced from the group? Have a look for yourself…

Finally, sources close to the Whitehouse told Nation One News that President Trump was aware of his position in the photo weeks in advance. Another source close to the President recounted part of an internal Whitehouse G-20 planning meeting where Trump said:

“This is great, great news! That picture will show Americans that I am not part of the Globalist crowd hurting America. I might big Big League, but I am not part of that crowd! Americans will understand that I am putting America First! I trust the American people because they trusted me!”

Overall President Trump drew a great deal of criticism about his stance on Climate Change. This was a huge success for Americans who believe that Climate Change is just another way for Globalists to steal American Jobs and strip America of her wealth.

At least he isn’t the kind of person who would go off and do something outrageous. His response to the news that ABC was cutting his show was much more subtle, but none the less a powerful message.

ABC News announced they were cutting Tim Allen’s show “The Last Man Standing.” The announcement to cancel the third most watched comedy show in the history of ABC was a shock to loyal viewers. Frustration and surprise followed the announcement.

Tim Allen didn’t make much of a fuss about it. He just moved on. Although he did use his Twitter account to express his sadness over the show being canceled.

Stunned and blindsided by the network I called home for the last six years. #lastmanstanding — Tim Allen (@ofctimallen) May 16, 2017

Today rumors began to swirl that “Last Man Standing” may continue after all. Sources inside Fox suggest the show will move to Fox and its affiliates along with “certain streaming services.” The show is actually owned by 20th Century Fox, a subsidiary of Fox Entertainment Group a.k.a Fox, not ABC.

ABC has canceled the show, but since it is owned by Fox, Fox can just move it. We are told that negotiations are under way with Fox and their affiliates to find a time for the show on their network. The Official Announcement to come within the next month.

Update Added: 5/23/2017

According to Deadline, the Parent TV Council has now Officially recommended that Fox replaces “The Mick” with “Last Man Standing,” saying:

“it’s a much safer show for families than The Mick and, for that matter, much safer than most programs on air on primetime broadcast television.”

ABC has angered Conservatives by canceling the show. Tim Allen was the clear victim of an attack on Conservatives which will further hurt ABCs bottom line. It looks like the Last Man Standing will be Tim Allen, at a new time and place with Fox.

He hopes the new rules will improve the already extremely high dropout rate of 30%.

Yes, you read that correctly. The government is adding more rules making it easier for predatory businesses to take advantage of High School graduates. Somehow they believe this will improve the dropout rate.

Beginning in 2020 Students must show they have something to do after High School. They can get a job, join the military, be accepted to college, or join a “gap year” program.

On this surface, this may seem like a good idea. A closer look at numbers tells a different story.

Chicago High School Graduates – New Jobs

In 2016 the Chicago school system announced a record breaking 20,438 graduates. Chicago added 34,400 new jobs in 2016. Sounds great right? NO!

Of the 34,400 jobs created only 7,500 of those jobs were available to High School graduates and even less to inexperienced High School graduates. That leaves the military, college or gap year programs.

The military recruits an average of 100,000 new members each year. That is an average of about 2,000 per state. Of course, some states are higher than others and we do not have access to that information. So, let’s assume that Chicago gets double the national average at 4,000.

So far, we have reached 11,500, which leaves about 9,000 students to college or gap year programs. The national average for college attendance between the ages of 18 and 24 is 33.6%. So this will account for another 6,900.

Chicago will be left with about 2,100 students attending gap year programs… Which leaves just one question.

How much does Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Barack Obama stand to gain from investments into Gap Year Programs?

Here is an idea Mr. Mayor. Bring more jobs to your city and stop creating new industries with your Crony Capitalist laws… Oh wait, but then how would you take advantage of the working poor???"

Here is Obama shaking hands with the Russian leader about three years ago. Notice any difference?

Who do you think represents the United States better? (As if I have to ask.)"

“THE APPRENTICE” has been on the air for 15 years! Trump is embarrassed the show has gone so far down hill since he left to run for the presidency.

Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't voluntarily leaving the Apprentice, he was fired by his bad (pathetic) ratings, not by me. Sad end to great show — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017

With Donald Trump, in the show’s FIRST YEAR, “The Apprentice” had a whopping 20,000,000 viewers! That is TWENTY MILLION PER WEEK!

This past year with Arnold Schwarzenegger, the show’s rating’s fell to about 5,000,000!

But the former Terminator actor is somehow blaming Trump!

“With Trump being involved in the show people have a bad taste and don’t want to participate as a spectator or as a sponsor or in any other way support the show,” Schwarzenegger said. “It’s a very divisive period now and I think this show got caught up in all that division.”

Fail then blame Trump? Sound familiar?

It makes you wonder if the Globalist Hollywood Executives put the failed governor of California in the Apprentice just to tarnish Donald Trump’s legacy! It won’t matter! President Trump’s legacy will be so much better than his years building the Apprentice!

Once again the Global Elite only hurt themselves and made President Donald Trump stronger. The show was TERMINATED and they just proved there was only ONE MAN good enough for the Apprentice. That man was Donald J. Trump!

The next four days could perhaps be the beginning of a return to the simple American idea of cooperation and common ground. Freedom Fest is based on one common theme. Working together to solve America’s problems.

Freedom Fest

Freedom Fest is all about respect, discussion, debate, reason, logic, leverage, and problem-solving. Nation One News is known for our entertaining and honest coverage and support of President Donald Trump. We make no apologies for sharing the truth and we look forward to bringing you honest coverage of Freedom Fest 2017.

Over the next four days, we are joining forces with online media. We will deliver in-depth and behind the scenes coverage of this important meeting of minds. To many, it looks like America is being ripped apart by a destructive political storm. Appearances can be deceiving. Amid the political storm, a calm center has formed.

President Trump

Slowly, but surely, President Trump is closing the gap between political extremes in America. Our country is staring down a double barrel crisis. On one side we have extremists who take to the streets destroying property, endangering lives, and towing the socialist line. On the other, extremists threaten to devalue President Trump’s work with their racist worldview and disruptive and unethical demeanor.

The far left and the far right can’t seem to reconcile their differences. Both sides use Trump to promote their causes. The far-left mouthpieces spew fake news, while the far-right damage the reputation of real journalism. In the middle of the storm, you can find the people who will always do what is right for America no matter what.

The Eye of the Storm

The eye of this political storm is growing in size. More and more Americans are seeking the safety, security, and CALM of historical American values. Meaningful discussion and debate about important American issues are happening despite this extremism. As you read this some of the smartest and brightest minds in the country converge on Las Vegas, Nevada. We are here.

You may not hear much about this from the Main Stream Media, but you can count on us to give you a blow by blow account of the hard work that will go down at Freedom Fest 2017.

So far we have counted three “Make America Great Again Hats,” and there are only about 150 people here… This is gonna be GREAT!

Stay tuned as we bring you up to date coverage. There is still time to attend Freedom Fest yourself. Visit their website: www.freedomfest.com"

I am an imperfect human being who tries each day to better myself. I own my mistakes and will never hide from the truth.

I believe mutual respect is the foundation that allows us to find common ground. The United States of America was literally built on common ground. Our country was established on the common ground of North America and the idea that Government should never tell people how to live their lives.

Things are not always what they seem. Take, for example, Democrat Beto O’Rourke. The first thing that comes to mind when I see Beto is how did an Irish American named O’Rourke wind up with a common Hispanic first name like “Beto?”

Beto is the Spanish version of BOB! Most of us who only speak English have no idea. So whats the big deal?

Beto is not his given name. His name is Robert Francis O’Rourke. He is a descendant of Irish immigrants. This guy might be WHITER than I am! You wouldn’t know it from his name…

He is currently a Congressman, but I found a little bit more about my competition. It looks like his Punk Rock career didn’t take off so now he is in Politics?

It’s not slinging mud if it’s TRUE! Please SHARE this and help me KEEP TEXAS RED in 2018!"

CNN’s Jim Acosta continues to attack President Trump every chance he gets. Most of the time it results in Fake News. Today was no different!

Earlier this morning Jim Acosta sent out a Tweet, directed at President Trump. In that Tweet, he accused the President of “finally” holding a press conference overseas. He ignored the fact that this only President Trump’s second trip abroad. Then he starts his typical whining about being called “fake news.”

Trump finally held a news conference overseas. But he took a question from a friendly reporter and then attacked CNN as ""fake news."" — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) July 6, 2017

Everyone knows about Jim Acosta’s showboating and his attacks on the President. Do you remember the time he was rude and interrupted Donald Trump? Who can forget, right!?! Donald Trump made it clear back then that he thinks CNN is “fake news.”

The attacks from this CNN Reporter haven’t stopped. After Jim Acosta’s inflammatory Tweet this morning, he took it a step further. He implied that President Trump was holding a “fake news conference” because CNN was not given an opportunity to ask a question.

Isn't it a ""fake news conference"" to take a question from a reporter who is essentially an ally of the White House? https://t.co/vD7DgAZXIv — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) July 6, 2017

It only took a few minutes for the Internet to catch on fire. Conservatives and Liberals both fired back at Jim Acosta. The most notable response was from Donald Trump Jr. He pointed out a very important fact.

If Jim Acosta thinks it is “fake news” when the President won’t take questions from CNN, does that mean every press conference held by Obama was “fake?”

So by that logic, was every news conference for the last 8 years #fakenews Jim? https://t.co/dui9XgmXgx — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 6, 2017

It looks like Don Jr. is fed up. After Acosta’s dishonest attack on the President, he ratcheted up his own Twitter heat! He Tweeted several more times about CNN.

Also CNN: Let's bully and intimidate citizens online so they never question our #fakenews again! #CNNBlackmail https://t.co/kKvjKTvg7D — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 6, 2017

No, I'm pretty sure it's their bias that makes them look biased. https://t.co/QhPOlZQ5uj — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 6, 2017

Finally, before Jim Acosta “the CNN reporter” made himself the news today, Donald Trump Jr. retweeted a valid question for CNN. So far, CNN has failed to answer the question from Charlie Kirk!

Right away, we open with the experts feel sorry for her because she is married to a Bombastic Billionaire. She is on her way to becoming a Global Icon, they acknowledge. They say she always tuned heads in her home country of Slovenia. She grew up under Communist rule, and claim her father was in the Communist party. Her Mother was a hard worker.

Friends say she didn’t drink or stay up late- or enjoy being the center of attention. She enjoyed her craft and her big dreams. Melania wanted to get into the bigger world. She always loved fashion and modeling. In 1993 she played the first female President.

Melania moved to the US at the age of 24 to pursue modeling. She liked the culture in America. Sept 1998 at 28, she met Donald Trump at a Fashion show. She later reported that she felt he had “Sparkle”. The couple did break up for a little while in 2002 around the time Donald decided to run for office.

Melania tried to stay out of the lime light, except for her modeling career. Once they got back together after their short breakup, they did not break up again. She appears in the movie in Zoolander. There were brief and short appearances on Donald’s reality show.

The couple wed in 2005. She was on the cover of Vouge Magazine in her wedding gown and the couple was on Larry King. She was the Bride of the year in a popular Aflac Commerical. And soon Barron was born. There was a celebrated photo shoot in People Magazine. And Melania loved being a mother. Melania got her citizenship soon after Barron was born. The media had a love affair with everything Donald and Melania Trump. They were celebrated and admired. Her Biographer says that Melania is great for Donald, “Because she is playful and not afraid of him”.

YET- On the left, they hate her..

Perhaps because her husband wanted to be President, on the heels one of their idols. Donald enters the President race, with Melania’s blessing. The author of, The Trump About Trump, says that Melania was reluctant to campaign. Refocusing on Melania’s speech that appeared to be plagiarized from Michelle’s Obama’s speeches. And that is when the nude photos surfaced. The campaign had started against her. Her Immigration status was called into question. She tweeted her defense. Then attention on her college degree. Then again an anti-Trump super pack PRO-Ted Cruz ad, mocking her for her Glamor “Bond Girl” shots.

On twitter the Response to the program is interesting:

btw, CNN got zero access to Melania for special. but that's fine–CNN doing 60-minute infomercial — Eric Boehlert (@EricBoehlert) March 11, 2017

Then the response to the undercover video , where Donald was joking with a friend . Melania was brave enough to defend her husband. Then recall the Pussy Bow at the Debate. The Question remains, did she do it on purpose?

There were accusations of forcible kissing by numerous women. There were reports and retractions and lawsuits. Melania then came out so strongly for American and for Donald Trump.

NoteWorthy:

Stop normalizing these people. Melania is the most useless ""First Lady"" in US history. — JenNJuice (@ZroFoxGivn) March 11, 2017

Melania wears what high fashion media call “Labels of Achievement”. She likes to shop online with a unique style. The FashionIndustryy says that is because she has a “Conflicted” relationship with the Fashion world. For example, she wore a sweater by a designer Derrek Lamb, who refused to dress her, “Because she could afford to buy it”.

She has a classic style. And her forcus is her face and hair, Canessa Friedman says. Even though she is not “Trumpian”, n Canessa’a opinion. Melainia helped design the dress she wore to the Inauguration. She is a “Throphy.”. One designer says she is the Mona Lisa of first Ladies.

But not to the Leftist Establishment Media:

Stop normalizing these people. Melania is the most useless ""First Lady"" in US history. — JenNJuice (@ZroFoxGivn) March 11, 2017

The reports are that Mrs. Trump dazzled the crowds. Yet she did not move to the White House. And now the discussion on Melania’s White House schedule. Although Melania has hired staff and made arrangements to have the East Wing decorated, the number of days Melania spends at the White House is a source of mockery for the left. Another topic that the left attacks Melaina on is her choice of social campaigns , Cyber Bullying.

Toward the end of the show, the interviews turn to digs at Melania for being very private. Overall the show was mostly positive, showing our first lady as strong, independent, beautiful and graceful. There were a few digs at her husband. There were no new interviews of Mrs. Trump.

We can see already that Melania will be loved by everyone except for those on the left who just hate President Trump’s platform of Free Enterprise and Freedom.

AND just in time, of course- there is a poll!

Then The White House Dropped the BOOM!,[],"MSNBC’s radical left-wing ideologue Rachel Maddow teased her cable news audience with the scoop of the century. Something that was sure to finally bring down President Donald Trump. It was on par with Geraldo opening Al Capone’s vault.

BREAKING: We've got Trump tax returns. Tonight, 9pm ET. MSNBC. (Seriously). — Rachel Maddow MSNBC (@maddow) March 14, 2017

Half an hour into her show, she dropped the bombshell.

Maddow produced two pages from Donald Trump’s 2005 tax returns . . . thereby proving to the world that then businessman Donald Trump — wait for it — paid his taxes!!!

In fact, he paid a fortune in taxes — $38 million on $150 million of income.

Thank you Rachel Maddow for proving to your #Trump hating followers how successful @realDonaldTrump is & that he paid $40mm in taxes! #Taxes — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 15, 2017

Doing the math, Donald Trump paid about 25% of his earned income in taxes.

Trump paid more in taxes than Rachel Maddow’s boss, MSNBC Comcast, which paid only 24% in taxes on average over the last five years.

Former president Obama’s tax rate for 2015 was only 18.7%.

Mitt Romey’s 2011 tax rate was 14%.

And Socialist Bernie Sanders paid only a 13.5% percent tax rate in 2014.

Even Maddow’s big tease went flat because twenty minutes before she went on air, the White House released this statement:

You know you are desperate for ratings when you are willing to violate the law to push a story about two pages of tax returns from over a decade ago. Before being elected President, Mr. Trump was one of the most successful businessmen in the world with a responsibility to his company, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required. That being said, Mr. Trump paid $38 million dollars even after taking into account large scale depreciation for construction, on an income of more than $150 million dollars, as well as paying tens of millions of dollars in other taxes such as sales and excise taxes and employment taxes and this illegally published return proves just that. Despite this substantial income figure and tax paid, it is totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns. The dishonest media can continue to make this part of their agenda, while the President will focus on his, which includes tax reform that will benefit all Americans.

It was such an epic fail that even The Hollywood Reporter mocked Maddow.

Rachel Maddow may just have helped Donald Trump win reelection in 2020."

In the wake of endless articles about “rumors” from “sources,” the truth came out in the early afternoon hours of Friday, July 21, 2017. Sean Spicer is has resigned as the White Press Secretary, BUT despite several incorrect reports, Anthony Scaramucci is not replacing him.

We have seen no evidence that this change in staff is in any way a scandal, which is a distortion by the Main Stream Media. Several news organizations are screaming “Scandal, Scandal, Scandal.” For example, CNBC released the news with a salacious title that reads “Sean Spicer resigns as White House press secretary after objecting to Scaramucci hire.”

The fact is that Sean Spicer resigned, he was not fired, and he will appear on Fox’s Hannity alongside Scaramucci tonight. Anthony Scaramucci is ACTUALLY REPLACING Michael Dubke who resigned on June 2, 2017. Sean Spicer is being backfilled by Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

Through history, the Whitehouse Press Secretary and Communications Directors don’t last very long. Since Ronald Reagan took office we have seen twelve Press Secretaries and five Presidents. Bill Clinton burned through five all by himself.

Communications Directors are even more likely to have short terms. From Reagan to Obama we saw twenty-three different people walk through the revolving door. As some people at CNN might say, this is:

Just Another NothingBurger!
